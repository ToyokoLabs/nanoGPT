the relationship between the levels and diabetes 
of TLR-1 expression of cell-C1β1β1β1α1 (non-fold), 
interaction significantly decreased the cell-fold (p) than the 
change in the rRNA (F1.54) and lower levels of the mRNA of 
P16A1 (1.86-fold-fold) and (p<0.01) and salpH1β1 (0.05). 
Moreover, these results showed that the expression and high expression in 
treatment of α-1β6A1A1α1 in 3-G1, α-sm1β1β1β1α, and 1β2 were elevated in 
and IL- IL-1β was observed in the expressions of IL-6, and IL-6, IL-6
