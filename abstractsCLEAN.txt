BACKGROUND: Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) is a 
175-billion-parameter natural language processing model that can generate 
conversation-style responses to user input.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT on questions 
within the scope of the United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 and 
Step 2 exams, as well as to analyze responses for user interpretability.
METHODS: We used 2 sets of multiple-choice questions to evaluate ChatGPT's 
performance, each with questions pertaining to Step 1 and Step 2. The first set 
was derived from AMBOSS, a commonly used question bank for medical students, 
which also provides statistics on question difficulty and the performance on an 
exam relative to the user base. The second set was the National Board of Medical 
Examiners (NBME) free 120 questions. ChatGPT's performance was compared to 2 
other large language models, GPT-3 and InstructGPT. The text output of each 
ChatGPT response was evaluated across 3 qualitative metrics: logical 
justification of the answer selected, presence of information internal to the 
question, and presence of information external to the question.
RESULTS: Of the 4 data sets, AMBOSS-Step1, AMBOSS-Step2, NBME-Free-Step1, and 
NBME-Free-Step2, ChatGPT achieved accuracies of 44% (44/100), 42% (42/100), 
64.4% (56/87), and 57.8% (59/102), respectively. ChatGPT outperformed 
InstructGPT by 8.15% on average across all data sets, and GPT-3 performed 
similarly to random chance. The model demonstrated a significant decrease in 
performance as question difficulty increased (P=.01) within the AMBOSS-Step1 
data set. We found that logical justification for ChatGPT's answer selection was 
present in 100% of outputs of the NBME data sets. Internal information to the 
question was present in 96.8% (183/189) of all questions. The presence of 
information external to the question was 44.5% and 27% lower for incorrect 
answers relative to correct answers on the NBME-Free-Step1 (P<.001) and 
NBME-Free-Step2 (P=.001) data sets, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: ChatGPT marks a significant improvement in natural language 
processing models on the tasks of medical question answering. By performing at a 
greater than 60% threshold on the NBME-Free-Step-1 data set, we show that the 
model achieves the equivalent of a passing score for a third-year medical 
student. Additionally, we highlight ChatGPT's capacity to provide logic and 
informational context across the majority of answers. These facts taken together 
make a compelling case for the potential applications of ChatGPT as an 
interactive medical education tool to support learning.

Interaction of ARRDC4 With GLUT1 Mediates Metabolic Stress in the Ischemic 
Heart.

Nakayama Y(1), Mukai N(1), Kreitzer G(1), Patwari P(2)(3), Yoshioka J(1)(2).

BACKGROUND: An ancient family of arrestin-fold proteins, termed alpha-arrestins, 
may have conserved roles in regulating nutrient transporter trafficking and 
cellular metabolism as adaptor proteins. One alpha-arrestin, TXNIP 
(thioredoxin-interacting protein), is known to regulate myocardial glucose 
uptake. However, the in vivo role of the related alpha-arrestin, ARRDC4 
(arrestin domain-containing protein 4), is unknown.
METHODS: We first tested whether interaction with GLUTs (glucose transporters) 
is a conserved function of the mammalian alpha-arrestins. To define the in vivo 
function of ARRDC4, we generated and characterized a novel Arrdc4 knockout (KO) 
mouse model. We then analyzed the molecular interaction between arrestin domains 
and the basal GLUT1.
RESULTS: ARRDC4 binds to GLUT1, induces its endocytosis, and blocks cellular 
glucose uptake in cardiomyocytes. Despite the closely shared protein structure, 
ARRDC4 and its homologue TXNIP operate by distinct molecular pathways. Unlike 
TXNIP, ARRDC4 does not increase oxidative stress. Instead, ARRDC4 uniquely 
mediates cardiomyocyte death through its effects on glucose deprivation and 
endoplasmic reticulum stress. At baseline, Arrdc4-KO mice have mild fasting 
hypoglycemia. Arrdc4-KO hearts exhibit a robust increase in myocardial glucose 
uptake and glycogen storage. Accordingly, deletion of Arrdc4 improves energy 
homeostasis during ischemia and protects cardiomyocytes against myocardial 
infarction. Furthermore, structure-function analyses of the interaction of 
ARRDC4 with GLUT1 using both scanning mutagenesis and deep-learning Artificial 
Intelligence identify specific residues in the C-terminal arrestin-fold domain 
as the interaction interface that regulates GLUT1 function, revealing a new 
molecular target for potential therapeutic intervention against myocardial 
ischemia.
CONCLUSIONS: These results uncover a new mechanism of ischemic injury in which 
ARRDC4 drives glucose deprivation-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress leading 
to cardiomyocyte death. Our findings establish ARRDC4 as a new scaffold protein 
for GLUT1 that regulates cardiac metabolism in response to ischemia and provide 
insight into the therapeutic strategy for ischemic heart disease.

BACKGROUND: Human pluripotent stem cell-derived muscle models show great 
potential for translational research. Here, we describe developmentally inspired 
methods for the derivation of skeletal muscle cells and their utility in 
skeletal muscle tissue engineering with the aim to model skeletal muscle 
regeneration and dystrophy in vitro.
METHODS: Key steps include the directed differentiation of human pluripotent 
stem cells to embryonic muscle progenitors followed by primary and secondary 
foetal myogenesis into three-dimensional muscle. To simulate Duchenne muscular 
dystrophy (DMD), a patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell line was 
compared to a CRISPR/Cas9-edited isogenic control line.
RESULTS: The established skeletal muscle differentiation protocol robustly and 
faithfully recapitulates critical steps of embryonic myogenesis in 
two-dimensional and three-dimensional cultures, resulting in functional human 
skeletal muscle organoids (SMOs) and engineered skeletal muscles (ESMs) with a 
regeneration-competent satellite-like cell pool. Tissue-engineered muscle 
exhibits organotypic maturation and function (up to 5.7 ± 0.5 mN tetanic twitch 
tension at 100 Hz in ESM). Contractile performance could be further enhanced by 
timed thyroid hormone treatment, increasing the speed of contraction (time to 
peak contraction) as well as relaxation (time to 50% relaxation) of single 
twitches from 107 ± 2 to 75 ± 4 ms (P < 0.05) and from 146 ± 6 to 100 ± 6 ms 
(P < 0.05), respectively. Satellite-like cells could be documented as largely 
quiescent PAX7+ cells (75 ± 6% Ki67- ) located adjacent to muscle fibres 
confined under a laminin-containing basal membrane. Activation of the engineered 
satellite-like cell niche was documented in a cardiotoxin injury model with 
marked recovery of contractility to 57 ± 8% of the pre-injury force 21 days 
post-injury (P < 0.05 compared to Day 2 post-injury), which was completely 
blocked by preceding irradiation. Absence of dystrophin in DMD ESM caused a 
marked reduction of contractile force (-35 ± 7%, P < 0.05) and impaired 
expression of fast myosin isoforms resulting in prolonged contraction 
(175 ± 14 ms, P < 0.05 vs. gene-edited control) and relaxation (238 ± 22 ms, 
P < 0.05 vs. gene-edited control) times. Restoration of dystrophin levels by 
gene editing rescued the DMD phenotype in ESM.
CONCLUSIONS: We introduce human muscle models with canonical properties of bona 
fide skeletal muscle in vivo to study muscle development, maturation, disease 
and repair.

BACKGROUND: Cachexia is a life-threatening condition observed in several 
pathologies, such as cancer or chronic diseases. Interleukin 10 (Il10) gene 
transfer is known to improve cachexia by downregulating Il6. Here, we used an 
IL10-knockout mouse model to simulate cachexia and investigate the effects of 
eggshell membrane (ESM), a resistant protein, on general pre-cachexia symptoms, 
which is particularly important for the development of cachexia therapeutics.
METHODS: Five-week-old male C57BL6/J mice were fed an AIN-93G powdered diet 
(WT), and 5-week-old male B6.129P2-Il10 < tm1Cgn>/J (IL10-/- ) mice were fed 
either the AIN-93G diet (KO) or an 8% ESM-containing diet (KOE) for 28 weeks. 
The tissue weight and levels of anaemia-, blood glucose-, lipid metabolism-, and 
muscular and colonic inflammation-related biochemical markers were measured. 
Transcriptomic analysis on liver and colon mucus and proteomic analysis on 
skeletal muscle were performed. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used to identify 
molecular pathways and networks. Caecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were 
identified using HPLC, and caecal bacteria DNA were subjected to metagenomic 
analysis. Flow cytometry analysis was performed to measure the CD4+ IL17+ T 
cells in mesenteric lymph nodes.
RESULTS: The body weight, weight of gastrocnemius muscle and fat tissues, colon 
weight/length ratio, plasma HDL and NEFA, muscular PECAM-1 levels (P < 0.01), 
plasma glucose and colonic mucosal myeloperoxidase activity (P < 0.05) and T 
helper (Th) 17 cell abundance (P = 0.071) were improved in KOE mice over KO 
mice. Proteomic analysis indicated the protective role of ESM in muscle weakness 
and maintenance of muscle formation (>1.5-fold). Transcriptomic analysis 
revealed that ESM supplementation suppressed the LPS/IL1-mediated inhibition of 
RXR function pathway in the liver and downregulated the colonic mucosal 
expression of chemokines and Th cell differentiation-related markers (P < 0.01) 
by suppressing the upstream BATF pathway. Analysis of the intestinal 
microenvironment revealed that ESM supplementation ameliorated the microbial 
alpha diversity and the abundance of microbiota associated with the degree of 
inflammation (P < 0.05) and increased the level of total organic acids, 
particularly of SCFAs such as butyrate (2.3-fold), which could inhibit Th1 and 
Th17 production.
CONCLUSIONS: ESM supplementation ameliorated the chief symptoms of cachexia, 
including anorexia, lean fat tissue mass, skeletal muscle wasting and reduced 
physical function. ESM also improved colon and skeletal muscle inflammation, 
lipid metabolism and microbial dysbiosis. These results along with the 
suppressed differentiation of Th cells could be associated with the beneficial 
intestinal microenvironment and, subsequently, attenuation of pre-cachexia. Our 
findings provide insights into the potential of ESM in complementary 
interventions for pre-cachexia prevention.

CONTEXT: The potential anti-inflammatory bioactivities of 
β-hydroxyisovalerylshikonin (β-HIVS) remain largely unknown.
OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying 
mechanisms of β-HIVS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with LPS (100 ng/mL) for 24 h 
were treated with the non-cytotoxic doses of β-HIVS (0.5 or 1 μM, determined by 
MTT and Trypan blue staining), qRT-PCR and FCM assay were used to examine 
macrophage polarization transitions. Western blotting was used to evaluate the 
activation of the AMPK/Nrf2 pathway. In vivo, C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided 
into vehicle control, LPS (10 mg/kg), and β-HIVS (2.5 mg/kg) combined with LPS 
(10 mg/kg) groups, blood samples, BALF, and lung tissues of mice were subjected 
to ELISA, qRT-PCR, FCM, and H&E staining.
RESULTS: β-HIVS (1 μM) inhibited LPS-induced expression of M1 macrophage markers 
(TNF-α: 0.29-fold, IL-1β: 0.32-fold), promoted the expression of M2 macrophage 
markers (CD206: 3.14-fold, Arginase-1: 3.98-fold) in RAW 264.7 cells; 
mechanistic studies showed that β-HIVS increased the expression of nuclear Nrf2 
(2.04-fold) and p-AMPK (3.65-fold) compared with LPS group (p < 0.05). In vivo, 
β-HIVS decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α: 1130.41 vs. 
334.88 pg/mL, IL-1β: 601.89 vs. 258.21 pg/mL in serum; TNF-α: 893.07 vs. 
418.21 pg/mL, IL-1β: 475.22 vs. 298.54 pg/mL in BALF), decreased the proportion 
of M1 macrophages (77.83 vs. 68.53%) and increased the proportion of M2 
macrophages (13.55 vs. 19.56%) in BALF, and reduced lung tissue damage and 
septic mice survival (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that β-HIVS may be a new potential 
anti-inflammatory agent.

Cancer-associated fibroblast-like fibroblasts in vocal fold leukoplakia suppress 
CD8(+)T cell functions by inducing IL-6 autocrine loop and interacting with Th17 
cells.

H(4).

The characteristics of fibroblast cells in head and neck precancerous lesion and 
its ability to secrete inflammatory cytokines and affect CD8+T cell functions 
remain unclear. Herein, we reported the existence of fibroblasts in 
human-derived vocal fold leukoplakia (VFL) with positive staining of fibroblast 
activation protein (FAP) and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). The fibroblasts from 
VFL and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) from head and neck squamous cell 
carcinoma (HNSCC) displayed similar cellular functions and robust inflammatory 
cytokine secretions. The effects of fibroblasts from VFL in inducing the 
apoptosis, depletion of CD8+ T cells and recruitment of regulatory T cells (Treg 
cells) were observed. We further assessed the autocrine loop within VFL 
fibroblasts to self-stimulate by secreting IL-6, TGF-β through the 
IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 pathway. The synergistic stimulation of IL-6 and TGF-β promoted 
Th17 cell differentiation and IL-17A secretion, which could result in fibroblast 
activation in another positive loop. Tocilizumab (TOC), a monoclonal antibody 
targeting IL-6R, managed to suppress the overexpression of both IL-6 and TGF-β 
in VFL fibroblasts, and thus blocking IL-6 autocrine loop and CAF-Th17 loop in 
vitro. In a murine model of oral leukoplakia (OL), local injection of TOC 
inhibited the outgrowth of lesions and showed notable effect in control of OL 
progression in vivo. Our findings establish a novel rationale for blocking the 
IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 pathway to inhibit vocal fold (oral) leukoplakia progression and 
postpone HNSCC tumorigenesis.

To Fold or Not to Fold: Diastereomeric Optimization of an α-Helical 
Antimicrobial Peptide.

Personne H(1), Paschoud T(1), Fulgencio S(1), Baeriswyl S(1), Köhler T(2), van 
Delden C(2)(3), Stocker A(1), Javor S(1), Reymond JL(1).

Membrane disruptive α-helical antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) offer an opportunity 
to address multidrug resistance; however, most AMPs are toxic and unstable in 
serum. These limitations can be partly overcome by introducing D-residues, which 
often confers protease resistance and reduces toxicity without affecting 
antibacterial activity, presumably due to lowered α-helicity. Here, we 
investigated 31 diastereomers of the α-helical AMP KKLLKLLKLLL. Three 
diastereomers containing two, three, and four D-residues showed increased 
antibacterial effects, comparable hemolysis, reduced toxicity against HEK293 
cells, and excellent serum stability, while another diastereomer with four 
D-residues additionally displayed lower hemolysis. X-ray crystallography 
confirmed that high or low α-helicity as measured by circular dichroism 
indicated α-helical or disordered structures independently of the number of 
chirality switched residues. In contrast to previous reports, α-helicity across 
diastereomers correlated with both antibacterial activity and hemolysis and 
revealed a complex relationship between stereochemistry, activity, and toxicity, 
highlighting the potential of diastereomers for property optimization.

Aberrant cortical development is driven by impaired cell cycle and translational 
control in a DDX3X syndrome model.

Hoye ML(1), Calviello L(2)(3), Poff AJ(1), Ejimogu NE(1), Newman CR(1), 
Montgomery MD(1), Ou J(4)(5), Floor SN(6)(7), Silver DL(1)(4)(5)(8)(9).

Mutations in the RNA helicase, DDX3X, are a leading cause of Intellectual 
Disability and present as DDX3X syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder 
associated with cortical malformations and autism. Yet, the cellular and 
molecular mechanisms by which DDX3X controls cortical development are largely 
unknown. Here, using a mouse model of Ddx3x loss-of-function we demonstrate that 
DDX3X directs translational and cell cycle control of neural progenitors, which 
underlies precise corticogenesis. First, we show brain development is sensitive 
to Ddx3x dosage; complete Ddx3x loss from neural progenitors causes microcephaly 
in females, whereas hemizygous males and heterozygous females show reduced 
neurogenesis without marked microcephaly. In addition, Ddx3x loss is sexually 
dimorphic, as its paralog, Ddx3y, compensates for Ddx3x in the developing male 
neocortex. Using live imaging of progenitors, we show that DDX3X promotes 
neuronal generation by regulating both cell cycle duration and neurogenic 
divisions. Finally, we use ribosome profiling in vivo to discover the repertoire 
of translated transcripts in neural progenitors, including those which are 
DDX3X-dependent and essential for neurogenesis. Our study reveals invaluable new 
insights into the etiology of DDX3X syndrome, implicating dysregulated 
progenitor cell cycle dynamics and translation as pathogenic mechanisms.

Plain Language Summary: During development, a complex network of genes ensures 
that the brain develops in the right way. In particular, they control how 
special ‘progenitor’ cells multiply and mature to form neurons during a process 
known as neurogenesis. Genetic mutations that interfere with neurogenesis can 
lead to disability and defects such as microcephaly, where children are born 
with abnormally small brains. DDX3X syndrome is a recently identified condition 
characterised by intellectual disability, delayed acquisition of movement and 
language skills, low muscle tone and, frequently, a diagnosis of autism spectrum 
disorder. It emerges when certain mutations are present in the DDX3X gene, which 
helps to control the process by which proteins are built in a cell (also known 
as translation). The syndrome affects girls more often than boys, potentially 
because DDX3X is carried on the X chromosome. Many of the disease-causing 
mutations in the DDX3X gene also reduce the levels of DDX3X protein. However, 
exactly what genes DDX3X controls and how its loss impairs brain development 
remain poorly understood. To address this problem, Hoye et al. set out to 
investigate the role of Ddx3x in mice neurogenesis. Experiments with genetically 
altered mice confirmed that complete loss of the gene indeed caused severe 
reduction in brain size at birth; just as in humans with mild microcephaly, this 
was only present in affected females. Further genetic studies revealed the 
reason for this: the closely related Ddx3y gene, which is only present on the Y 
(male) chromosome, helped to compensate for the loss of Ddx3x in the male mice. 
Next, the effect of the loss of just one copy of Ddx3x on neurogenesis was 
examined by following how progenitor cells developed. This likely reflects DDX3X 
levels in patients with the syndrome. Loss of the gene made the cells divide 
more slowly and produce fewer mature nerve cells, suggesting that smaller brain 
size and brain malformations caused by mutations in DDX3X could be due to 
impaired neurogenesis. Finally, a set of further biochemical and genetic 
experiments revealed a key set of genes that are under the control of the DDX3X 
protein. These results shed new light on how a molecular actor which helps to 
control translation is a key part of normal brain development. This 
understanding could one day help improve clinical management or treatments for 
DDX3X syndrome and related neurological disorders.

α-Synuclein Conformational Plasticity: Physiologic States, Pathologic Strains, 
and Biotechnological Applications.

Li A(1)(2), Rastegar C(1)(3), Mao X(1)(4).

α-Synuclein (αS) is remarkable for both its extensive conformational plasticity 
and pathologic prion-like properties. Physiologically, αS may populate 
disordered monomeric, helically folded tetrameric, or membrane-bound oligomeric 
states. Pathologically, αS may assemble into toxic oligomers and subsequently 
fibrils, the prion-like transmission of which is implicated in a class of 
neurodegenerative disorders collectively termed α-synucleinopathies. Notably, αS 
does not adopt a single "amyloid fold", but rather exists as structurally 
distinct amyloid-like conformations referred to as "strains". The inoculation of 
animal models with different strains induces distinct pathologies, and emerging 
evidence suggests that the propagation of disease-specific strains underlies the 
differential pathologies observed in patients with different 
α-synucleinopathies. The characterization of αS strains has provided insight 
into the structural basis for the overlapping, yet distinct, symptoms of 
Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, and dementia with Lewy bodies. In 
this review, we first explore the physiological and pathological differences 
between conformational states of αS. We then discuss recent studies on the 
influence of micro-environmental factors on αS species formation, propagation, 
and the resultant pathological characteristics. Lastly, we review how an 
understanding of αS conformational properties has been translated to emerging 
strain amplification technologies, which have provided further insight into the 
role of specific strains in distinct α-synucleinopathies, and show promise for 
the early diagnosis of disease.

Breakthrough methods in machine learning (ML), protein structure prediction, and 
novel ultrafast structural aligners are revolutionizing structural biology. 
Obtaining accurate models of proteins and annotating their functions on a large 
scale is no longer limited by time and resources. The most recent method to be 
top ranked by the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) assessment, 
AlphaFold 2 (AF2), is capable of building structural models with an accuracy 
comparable to that of experimental structures. Annotations of 3D models are 
keeping pace with the deposition of the structures due to advancements in 
protein language models (pLMs) and structural aligners that help validate these 
transferred annotations. In this review we describe how recent developments in 
ML for protein science are making large-scale structural bioinformatics 
available to the general scientific community.

Phase 1 and preclinical profiling of ESM-HDAC391, a myeloid-targeted histone 
deacetylase inhibitor, shows enhanced pharmacology and monocytopaenia.

Gibson A(1), Maller NC(1), Sharp C(1), Tough DF(1), Prinjha RK(1), Lewis HD(1).

AIMS: To improve the tolerability and therapeutic application of histone 
deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), by application of an esterase-sensitive motif 
(ESM), to target pharmacological activity directly to mononuclear myeloid cells 
expressing the processing enzyme carboxylesterase-1 (CES1).
METHODS: This first-in-human study comprised single and multiple ascending dose 
cohorts to determine safety and tolerability. Pharmacodynamic parameters 
included acetylation, cytokine inhibition and intracellular concentrations of 
processed acid metabolite in isolated monocytes. Mechanistic work was conducted 
in vitro and in a CES1/Es1elo mouse strain.
RESULTS: ESM-HDAC391 showed transient systemic exposure (plasma half-life of 
21-30 min) but selective retention of processed acid for at least 12 hours, 
resulting in robust targeted mechanistic engagement (increased acetylation in 
monocytes plus inhibition of ex vivo stimulated cytokine production). 
ESM-HDAC391 was well tolerated and clinical toxicities common to non-targeted 
HDACi were not observed. ESM-HDAC391 treatment was accompanied by the novel 
finding of a dose-dependent monocyte depletion that was transient and reversible 
and which plateaued at 0.06 × 109 monocytes/L after repeat dosing with 20 or 
40 mg. Characterisation of monocyte depletion in transgenic mice (CES1/Es1elo ) 
suggested that colony stimulating factor 1 receptor loss on circulating cells 
contributed to ESM-HDAC-mediated depletion. Further mechanistic investigations 
using human monocytes in vitro demonstrated HDACi-mediated change in myeloid 
fate through modulation of colony stimulating factor 1 receptor and downstream 
effects on cell differentiation.
CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate selective targeting of monocytes in 
humans using the ESM approach and identify monocytopaenia as a novel outcome of 
ESM-HDACi treatment, with implications for potential benefit of these molecules 
in myeloid-driven diseases.

24-Nor-allobetulins possess strong α-glucosidase inhibitory activity.

Zakirova L(1), Baikova I(1), Smirnova I(1), Тretyakova E(1), Lobov A(1), Nguyen 
HTT(2), Каzakova O(1).

A series of 24-nor-allobetulin derivatives holding 3β-hydroxy-, oxime, 
methoxyoxime, lactame and 4-bromobenzylidene substituents have been synthesized 
and their differences in the NMR spectra were studied in detail. It was revealed 
that 3-oxo-24-nor-allobetulin loses selectivity in the reaction of oximation and 
forms a mixture of Z/E oximes (and methoxyoximes) in contract to the related 
derivatives of native scaffold (that forms only E-isomers). The screening of 
α-glucosidase inhibitory activity revealed that 24-nor-allobetulins are more 
active than allobetulins. The lead 3-oxo-24-nor-allobetulin with IC50 0.49 µM 
was more than 60-fold and 500-fold active than acarbose and 3-oxo-allobetulin, 
respectively. We can conclude that the removal of the C-24 methyl group 
significantly increased the antidiabetic effect and 24-nor-allobetulins should 
be identified as the new and promising scaffolds as α-glucosidase inhibitors on 
the basis of triterpenoids.

Tree-ring evidence of ecological stress memory.

Mu Y(1), Lyu L(1), Li Y(1)(2), Fang O(1).

Plants experiencing stress could develop the ability to reshape their response 
toward present stress based on past stress experience, called 'ecological stress 
memory' (ESM), which is important for plant acclimation to repeated stresses. 
Although ESM has been largely reported, it remains unclear whether ESM could 
improve tree resistance to recurrent stress in subsequent decades. Here, we 
explore it from a tree-ring network of 1491 trees from 50 long-living juniper 
forests on the Tibetan Plateau. Through comparing performances of tree radial 
growth in past sequential growth stresses, we found that trees could obtain ESM 
under antecedent stresses and elevate resistance to subsequent stress after 
several years or even decades. Such positive effects of ESM are associated with 
post-stress recovery. Trees with slow recovery trajectories after antecedent 
stress show significantly improved resistance to subsequent stress, while trees 
with extremely fast post-stress recovery showed decreased resistance to 
subsequent stress. These results imply that temporary depressive tree radial 
growth after antecedent stress might be a trigger of long storage of ESM. 
Incorporating positive effects of ESM and relationship between ESM activation 
and post-stress recovery into future Earth system models could advance our 
capacity to predict forest dynamics and forest ecosystem stabilization under 
future stress conditions.

A systemic review of the role of enterotoxic Bacteroides fragilis in colorectal 
cancer.

Scott N(1), Whittle E(2), Jeraldo P(3), Chia N(4).

Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) has received significant attention 
for a possible association with, or causal role in, colorectal cancer (CRC). The 
goal of this review was to assess the status of the published evidence 
supporting (i) the association between ETBF and CRC and (ii) the causal role of 
ETBF in CRC. PubMed and Scopus searches were performed in August 2021 to 
identify human, animal, and cell studies pertaining to the role of ETBF in CRC. 
Inclusion criteria included the use of cell lines, mice, exposure to BFT or 
ETBF, and detection of bft. Review studies were excluded, and studies were 
limited to the English language. Quality of study design and risk of bias 
analysis was performed on the cell, animal, and human studies using ToxRTools, 
SYRCLE, and NOS, respectively. Ninety-five eligible studies were identified, 
this included 22 human studies, 24 animal studies, 43 cell studies, and 6 
studies that included both cells and mice studies. We found that a large 
majority of studies supported an association or causal role of ETBF in CRC, as 
well as high levels of study bias was detected in the in vitro and in vivo 
studies. The high-level heterogeneity in study design and reporting made it 
difficult to synthesize these findings into a unified conclusion, suggesting 
that the need for future studies that include improved mechanistic models, 
longitudinal in vitro and in vivo evidence, and appropriate control of 
confounding factors will be required to confirm whether ETBF has a direct role 
in CRC etiopathogenesis.

Evolutionary-scale prediction of atomic-level protein structure with a language 
model.

Verkuil R(1), Kabeli O(1), Shmueli Y(1), Dos Santos Costa A(4), Fazel-Zarandi 
M(1), Sercu T(1), Candido S(1), Rives A(1)(2).

Recent advances in machine learning have leveraged evolutionary information in 
multiple sequence alignments to predict protein structure. We demonstrate direct 
inference of full atomic-level protein structure from primary sequence using a 
large language model. As language models of protein sequences are scaled up to 
15 billion parameters, an atomic-resolution picture of protein structure emerges 
in the learned representations. This results in an order-of-magnitude 
acceleration of high-resolution structure prediction, which enables large-scale 
structural characterization of metagenomic proteins. We apply this capability to 
construct the ESM Metagenomic Atlas by predicting structures for >617 million 
metagenomic protein sequences, including >225 million that are predicted with 
high confidence, which gives a view into the vast breadth and diversity of 
natural proteins.

High value applications and current commercial market for eggshell membranes and 
derived bioactives.

Kulshreshtha G(1), Diep T(2), Hudson HA(2), Hincke MT(3).

Chicken eggshell membrane (ESM) is a highly insoluble structure that is greatly 
stabilized by extensive desmosine, isodesmosine, and disulfide cross-linkages. 
The ESM possesses numerous biological functions including anti-microbial, 
anti-inflammatory, anti-wrinkle, and antioxidant activities. The ESM is mainly 
proteinaceous; proteomics and bioinformatics analysis of ESM has 
identified > 500 proteins, such as collagens, glycoproteins, avian 
beta-defensins, and lysozyme. ESM also contains significant amounts of 
carbohydrate, including hyaluronic acid (HA). In general, HA plays an important 
role in tissue hydration and cellular mechanisms such as growth, 
differentiation, and transport, and has diverse health and medical applications. 
Despite ESM being rich in important bioactive compounds, it is often considered 
as a waste product of the egg-breaking industry and is under-utilized. A major 
challenge for the successful commercial exploitation of ESM and bioactive 
constituents is its limited solubility and bioavailability due to cross-linkages 
of ESM fibers. Various processing and extraction methods are employed to 
overcome these limitations and improve the production of HA and collagen-based 
ESM formats. Moreover, we believe that there is a wide scope to exploit ESM for 
novel applications, leading to new intellectual property (IP) and patenting 
opportunities. This review presents an overview of scientific background, IP 
landscape and current commercial market for ESM and derived bioactives including 
collagens and HA. A detailed literature survey is provided for each area of 
interest. We analyze regulatory guidelines for ESM, contrasting quality control 
/ microbial safety assessment in cosmetics and personal care products (hazard 
based) with that of the food industry (risk-based). New perspectives for 
upcycling of ESM waste to commercially viable high-value biomaterials as 
nutraceutical supplements and as cosmetics ingredients are discussed. This 
overview of ESM separation techniques and applications could form the basis for 
directed research and product development in order to exploit the unique 
bioactivities of ESM.

Hypericum hengshanense is a previously uninvestigated endemic plant species of 
China. Three new aclyphloroglucinols, hengshanols A-C (1-3), and two new 
geranyl-α-pyrones, hengshanpyol D and E (4 and 5), together with three known 
compounds were isolated from the aerial parts of H. hengshanense. The structure 
of these compounds were elucidated by NMR, MS, optical rotation, and ECD data. 
All compounds were isolated from H. hengshanense for the first time. Among them, 
compounds 2-4 may have anti-laryngeal cancer activity. Compounds isolated were 
tested for glucose uptake in L6 cells, and compound 4 showed the most potent 
glucose uptake with 1.62-fold enhancement.

GraphML-SBGN bidirectional converter for metabolic networks.

Balaur I(1)(2), Roy L(1), Touré V(1)(3), Mazein A(1)(2)(4), Auffray C(1).

Systems biology researchers need feasible solutions for editing and 
visualisation of large biological diagrams. Here, we present the ySBGN 
bidirectional converter that translates metabolic pathways, developed in the 
general-purpose yEd Graph Editor (using the GraphML format) into the Systems 
Biology Graphical Notation Markup Language (SBGN-ML) standard format and vice 
versa. We illustrate the functionality of this converter by applying it to the 
translation of the ReconMap resource (available in the SBGN-ML format) to the 
yEd-specific GraphML and back. The ySBGN tool makes possible to draw extensive 
metabolic diagrams in a powerful general-purpose graph editor while providing 
results in the standard SBGN format.

NeuroPred-PLM: an interpretable and robust model for neuropeptide prediction by 
protein language model.

Wang L(1)(2), Huang C(3), Wang M(1), Xue Z(1)(3), Wang Y(1)(2).

Neuropeptides are a diverse and complex class of signaling molecules that 
regulate a variety of biological processes. Neuropeptides provide many 
opportunities for the discovery of new drugs and targets for the treatment of a 
wide range of diseases, and thus, computational tools for the rapid and accurate 
large-scale identification of neuropeptides are of great significance for 
peptide research and drug development. Although several machine learning-based 
prediction tools have been developed, there is room for improvement in the 
performance and interpretability of the proposed methods. In this work, we 
developed an interpretable and robust neuropeptide prediction model, named 
NeuroPred-PLM. First, we employed a language model (ESM) of proteins to obtain 
semantic representations of neuropeptides, which could reduce the complexity of 
feature engineering. Next, we adopted a multi-scale convolutional neural network 
to enhance the local feature representation of neuropeptide embeddings. To make 
the model interpretable, we proposed a global multi-head attention network that 
could be used to capture the position-wise contribution to neuropeptide 
prediction via the attention scores. In addition, NeuroPred-PLM was developed 
based on our newly constructed NeuroPep 2.0 database. Benchmarks based on the 
independent test set show that NeuroPred-PLM achieves superior predictive 
performance compared with other state-of-the-art predictors. For the convenience 
of researchers, we provide an easy-to-install PyPi package 
(https://pypi.org/project/NeuroPredPLM/) and a web server 
(https://huggingface.co/spaces/isyslab/NeuroPred-PLM).

NetGO 3.0: Protein Language Model Improves Large-scale Functional Annotations.

Wang S(1), You R(1), Liu Y(2), Xiong Y(3), Zhu S(4).

As one of the state-of-the-art automated function prediction (AFP) methods, 
NetGO 2.0 integrates multi-source information to improve the performance. 
However, it mainly utilizes the proteins with experimentally supported 
functional annotations without leveraging valuable information from a vast 
number of unannotated proteins. Recently, protein language models have been 
proposed to learn informative representations [e.g., Evolutionary Scale 
Modelling (ESM)-1b embedding] from protein sequences based on self-supervision. 
We represented each protein by ESM-1b and used logistic regression (LR) to train 
a new model, LR-ESM, for AFP. The experimental results showed that LR-ESM 
achieved comparable performance with the best-performing component of NetGO 2.0. 
Therefore, by incorporating LR-ESM into NetGO 2.0, we developed NetGO 3.0 to 
improve the performance of AFP extensively. NetGO 3.0 is freely accessible at

An Experience Sampling Measure of the Key Features of Rumination.

Hoebeke Y(1), Blanchard MA(1)(2), Contreras A(1), Heeren A(1)(2)(3).

OBJECTIVE: Research indicates that rumination can be viewed as a dynamic process 
that fluctuates over time, within hours and days. An increasing number of 
intensive longitudinal studies on rumination are accordingly being conducted and 
published using experiencing sampling methodology (ESM), a technique with 
measurements in everyday life. Yet, this literature suffers from a profound 
caveat: rumination has so far been conceptualized and measured as a unitary 
construct in these ESM studies. This is unfortunate, since such a unitary view 
contrasts with prominent contemporary models that regard rumination as a 
multifaceted construct, wherein the key features are not interchangeable and 
should therefore be measured separately. Moreover, no validated ESM measure of 
the key features of rumination has yet been developed. Therefore, we developed 
and validated an ESM protocol and the first ESM questionnaire to assess 
rumination as a multifaceted construct, measuring five features of rumination.
METHOD: We conducted an ESM study in a community sample of 40 French-speaking 
participants. They answered the five rumination ESM items in French four times a 
day for fourteen days. At the end of the ESM assessment period, participants 
completed trait-like questionnaires of rumination, depression, and general 
anxiety.
RESULTS: The ESM rumination items exhibited good psychometric properties, 
including excellent within-person variability and convergent validity with 
corresponding trait-like constructs.
CONCLUSIONS: Although further validation is warranted, this novel ESM assessment 
protocol of rumination as a multifaceted construct (validated in French and 
translated into English) will allow future researchers to study how rumination's 
features fluctuate and interact with other constructs over time.

Relationship between the thickness of erector spinae muscles and mortality in 
patients with pulmonary tuberculosis.

Shimoda M(1), Yoshiyama T(2), Tanaka Y(2), Morimoto K(2), Okumura M(2), Kodama 
T(2), Nakajima K(2), Yoshimori K(2), Ohta K(2).

BACKGROUND: Skeletal muscle mass is a known predictor of mortality in older 
patients. However, its relationship with tuberculosis is unclear. Skeletal 
muscle mass is determined by the cross-sectional area of erector spinae muscle 
(ESMCSA). Additionally, the erector spinae muscle thickness (ESMT) is an easier 
measurement than ESMCSA. This study investigated the relationship of ESMT and 
ESMCSA with mortality in tuberculosis patients.
METHODS: We retrospectively collected the data of 267 older patients (age ≥65 
years) who were hospitalized due to tuberculosis at the Fukujuji Hospital from 
January 2019 to July 2021. This included 40 patients with 60-day mortality (the 
death group) and 227 patients with 60-day survival (the alive group). Here, we 
assessed the correlations between ESMCSA and ESMT, and the data were compared 
between the two groups.
RESULTS: ESMT had a strong proportional relationship with ESMCSA (r = 0.991, 
p < 0.001). ESMCSA (median 670.2 mm2 [interquartile range (IQR): 585.1-760.9] 
vs. 914.3 mm2 [717.6-1141.6], p < 0.001) and ESMT (median 16.7 mm [15.4-18.6] 
vs. 21.1 mm [18.0-25.5], p < 0.001) were significantly lower in the patients in 
the death group than those of patients in the alive group. A multivariable Cox 
proportional hazard model for 60-day mortality showed significantly independent 
differences in ESMT (hazard ratio [HR] 0.870 [95% confidence interval (Cl): 
0.795-0.952], p = 0.003) and ESMCSA (HR 0.998 [95% Cl: 0.996-0.999], p = 0.009).
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a strong correlation between ESMCSA and 
ESMT, which were risk factors for mortality in patients with tuberculosis. 
Therefore, using ESMT is easier to predict mortality than ESMCSA.

Distributions of α- and δ-TOCopherol in Intact Olive and Soybean Oil-in-Water 
Emulsions at Various Acidities: A Test of the Sensitivity of the Pseudophase 
Kinetic Model.

Fernández-Ventoso L(1), Toba-Pérez A(1), Losada-Barreiro S(1), Paiva-Martins 
F(2), Bravo-Díaz C(1).

During the last years, the formalism of the pseudophase kinetic model (PKM) has 
been successfully applied to determine the distributions of antioxidants and 
their effective interfacial concentrations, and to assess the relative 
importance of emulsion and antioxidant properties (oil and surfactant nature, 
temperature, acidity, chemical structure, hydrophilic-liphophilic balance (HLB), 
etc.) on their efficiency in intact lipid-based emulsions. The PKM permits 
separating the contributions of the medium and of the concentration to the 
overall rate of the reaction. In this paper, we report the results of a 
specifically designed experiment to further test the suitability of the PKM to 
evaluate the distributions of antioxidants among the various regions of intact 
lipid-based emulsions and provide insights into their chemical reactivity in 
multiphasic systems. For this purpose, we employed the antioxidants α- and 
δ-TOCopherol (α- and δ-TOC, respectively) and determined, at different acidities 
well below their pKa, the interfacial rate constants kI for the reaction between 
16-ArN2+ and α- and δ-TOC, and the antioxidant distributions in intact emulsions 
prepared with olive and soybean oils. Results show that the effective 
interfacial concentration of δ-TOC is higher than that of α-TOC in 1:9 (v/v) 
soybean and 1:9 olive oil emulsions. The effective interfacial concentrations of 
tocopherols are much higher (15-96-fold) than the stoichiometric concentrations, 
as the effective interfacial concentrations of both δ-TOC and α-TOC in soybean 
oil emulsions are higher (2-fold) than those in olive oil emulsions. Overall, 
the results demonstrate that the PKM grants an effective separation of the 
medium and concentration effects, demonstrating that the PKM constitutes a 
powerful non-destructive tool to determine antioxidant concentrations in intact 
emulsions and to assess the effects of various factors affecting them.

Structure and function of microbial α-l-fucosidases: a mini review.

Wu H(1), Owen CD(2)(3), Juge N(4).

Fucose is a monosaccharide commonly found in mammalian, insect, microbial and 
plant glycans. The removal of terminal α-l-fucosyl residues from 
oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates is catalysed by α-l-fucosidases. To date, 
glycoside hydrolases (GHs) with exo-fucosidase activity on α-l-fucosylated 
substrates (EC 3.2.1.51, EC 3.2.1.-) have been reported in the GH29, GH95, 
GH139, GH141 and GH151 families of the Carbohydrate Active Enzymes (CAZy) 
database. Microbes generally encode several fucosidases in their genomes, often 
from more than one GH family, reflecting the high diversity of naturally 
occuring fucosylated structures they encounter. Functionally characterised 
microbial α-l-fucosidases have been shown to act on a range of substrates with 
α-1,2, α-1,3, α-1,4 or α-1,6 fucosylated linkages depending on the GH family and 
microorganism. Fucosidases show a modular organisation with catalytic domains of 
GH29 and GH151 displaying a (β/α)8-barrel fold while GH95 and GH141 show a 
(α/α)6 barrel and parallel β-helix fold, respectively. A number of crystal 
structures have been solved in complex with ligands, providing structural basis 
for their substrate specificity. Fucosidases can also be used in 
transglycosylation reactions to synthesise oligosaccharides. This mini review 
provides an overview of the enzymatic and structural properties of microbial 
α-l-fucosidases and some insights into their biological function and 
biotechnological applications.

G(4), Rocchetti M(3), Starace F(2), Zamparini M(5), de Girolamo G(5).

The application of innovative technologies in psychiatry is promising, but the 
debate about its feasibility is not settled. Our aim was to investigate and 
compare adherence to and usability of 7-day monitoring with an Experience 
Sampling Method (ESM) and Actigraphy among a sample of individuals with a 
diagnosis of Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders (SSD) and paired healthy controls. 
Twenty-two patients living in residential facilities (RFs), 20 outpatients and 
26 controls were enrolled in this study as part of the DiAPAson project. 
Participants wore an actigraph and were evaluated for daily time use and mood 
with a smartphone-based ESM. Then, they completed questionnaires to assess the 
usability of the devices and were interviewed. Adherence was assessed as the 
percentage of time spent wearing actigraph and answering ESM notifications. 
Residential patients, compared to controls, showed significantly higher 
usability of the actigraph and lower adherence to both the actigraph and ESM. 
From the qualitative interviews, four high-order themes emerged: effects of 
monitoring, adherence and usability, emotions and mental states, and advice. 
Findings are promising for the application of these methodologies in such 
populations. The role of multidisciplinary staff in RFs is crucial for 
guaranteeing the realization of such projects.

High-efficiency decomposition of eggshell membrane by a keratinase from 
Meiothermus taiwanensis.

Lien YC(1), Lai SJ(2)(3), Lin CY(1), Wong KP(#)(4), Chang MS(#)(4), Wu SH(5).

Eggshell membrane (ESM), a plentiful biological waste, consists of collagen-like 
proteins and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) such as hyaluronic acid (HA). Here we 
used a keratinase (oeMtaker)-mediated system to decompose ESM. The best reaction 
condition was established by incubating the solution containing oeMtaker, sodium 
sulfite, and ESM with a weight ratio of 1:120:600. ESM enzymatic hydrolysate 
(ESM-EH) showed a high proportion of essential amino acids and type X collagen 
peptides with 963-2259 Da molecular weights. The amounts of GAGs and sulfated 
GAGs in ESM-EH were quantified as 6.4% and 0.7%, respectively. The precipitated 
polysaccharides with an average molecular weight of 1300-1700 kDa showed an 
immunomodulatory activity by stimulating pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and 
TNF-α) production. In addition, a microorganism-based system was established to 
hydrolyze ESM by Meiothermus taiwanensis WR-220. The amounts of GAGs and 
sulfated GAGs in the system were quantified as 0.9% and 0.1%, respectively. 
Based on our pre-pilot tests, the system shows great promise in developing into 
a low-cost and high-performance process. These results indicate that the 
keratinase-mediated system could hydrolyze ESM more efficiently and produce more 
bioactive substances than ever for therapeutical applications and dietary 
supplements.

Towards an extension of equivalent system mass for human exploration missions on 
Mars.

Ho D(1)(2), Makrygiorgos G(1)(3), Hill A(1)(2), Berliner AJ(4)(5).

NASA mission systems proposals are often compared using an equivalent system 
mass (ESM) framework, wherein all elements of a technology to deliver an 
effect-its components, operations, and logistics of delivery-are converted to 
effective masses, which has a known cost scale in space operations. To date, ESM 
methods and the tools for system comparison largely fail to consider 
complexities stemming from multiple transit and operations stages, such as would 
be required to support a crewed mission to Mars, and thus do not account for 
different mass equivalency factors during each period and the inter-dependencies 
of the costs across the mission segments. Further, ESM does not account well for 
the differential reliabilities of the underlying technologies. The uncertainty 
in the performance of technology should incur an equivalent mass penalty for 
technology options that might otherwise provide a mass advantage. Here we draw 
attention to the importance of addressing these limitations and formulate the 
basis of an extension of ESM that allows for a direct method for analyzing, 
optimizing, and comparing different mission systems. We outline a preliminary 
example of applying extended ESM (xESM) through a techno-economic calculation of 
crop-production technologies as an illustrative case for developing offworld 
biomanufacturing systems.

BACKGROUND: There are increasing evidences for a direct relationship between the 
vascular system and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The aim of this study was to 
investigate the relationship between circulating endothelial cell specific 
molecule-1 (ESM-1), adhesion molecules and subclinical atherosclerosis in 
patients with OSA.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study in which 161 patients with OSA and 56 
controls were recruited. Demographic data, biochemical and polysomnography 
parameters were collected. We used a powerful high-throughput Multiplex 
Immunobead Assay technique to simultaneously test plasm levels of ESM-1, 
P-selectin, E-selectin, L-selectin, inter-cellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), 
and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1). Carotid intima-media thickness 
(CIMT) were measured as parameters of vascular endothelial dysfunction and early 
atherosclerosis.
RESULTS: Increasing circulating levels of ESM-1, P-selectin, E-selectin, 
L-selectin, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were found increased in patients with OSA (all 
P &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, OSA patients exhibited increased CIMT than controls 
(P &lt; 0.05). Multivariate linear analysis indicated that elevated ESM-1, 
P-Selectin, E-selectin, and L-selectin levels were associated with AHI (all 
P &lt; 0.05). Moreover, multivariate analysis showed that increasing ESM-1, 
VCAM-1, P-Selectin, and L-selectin were significantly associated with thick CIMT 
in OSA patients (all P &lt; 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Increased circulating ESM-1 and adhesion molecules associated with 
thick CIMT in OSA, which is a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis. Strict 
attention to monitor circulating ESM-1 and adhesion molecules is necessary for 
early detection of subclinical atherosclerosis in OSA patients.

Lifetime and Current Self-Harm Thoughts and Behaviors and Their Relationship to 
Parent and Peer Attachment.

Janssens JJ(1), Myin-Germeys I(1), Lafit G(1)(2), Achterhof R(1), Hagemann N(1), 
Hermans KSFM(1), Hiekkaranta AP(1), Lecei A(3), Kirtley OJ(1).

Background: Previous research suggests attachment is a vulnerability factor for 
self-harm thoughts and behaviors in adults. Yet, few studies have investigated 
this relationship during adolescence, although adolescence is a critical period 
for changes in attachment relationships and self-harm onset. Whether and how 
attachment relates to self-harm thoughts and behaviors as measured in daily life 
is also unknown. Aims: To investigate whether and how paternal, maternal, and 
peer attachment are associated with lifetime and current adolescent self-harm 
thoughts and behaviors. Additionally, to examine how different attachment bonds 
interact in relation to lifetime and current adolescent self-harm thoughts and 
behaviors. Method: Pre-existing data from N = 1,913 adolescents of the SIGMA 
study were used. Attachment and lifetime history of self-harm thoughts and 
behaviors were measured via retrospective questionnaires. Current self-harm 
thoughts and behaviors were assessed 10 times per day for 6 days using the 
experience sampling method (ESM). Results: Paternal and maternal attachments 
were associated with lifetime self-harm thoughts and behaviors and current 
self-harm thoughts. No significant associations were found between peer 
attachment and self-harm outcomes. Limitations: Some analyses were underpowered. 
Conclusion: Our results highlight the importance of parent-child attachment 
relationships, which may be intervention targets for prevention and treatment of 
adolescent self-harm.

    Kidney360. 2022 Dec 29;3(12):1998-2000.

BACKGROUND: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the most common cause of kidney 
failure in the world, and novel predictive biomarkers and molecular mechanisms 
of disease are needed. Endothelial cell-specific molecule-1 (Esm-1) is a 
secreted proteoglycan that attenuates inflammation. We previously identified 
that a glomerular deficiency of Esm-1 associates with more pronounced 
albuminuria and glomerular inflammation in DKD-susceptible relative to 
DKD-resistant mice, but its contribution to DKD remains unexplored.
METHODS: Using hydrodynamic tail-vein injection, we overexpress Esm-1 in 
DKD-susceptible DBA/2 mice and delete Esm-1 in DKD-resistant C57BL/6 mice to 
study the contribution of Esm-1 to DKD. We analyze clinical indices of DKD, 
leukocyte infiltration, podocytopenia, and extracellular matrix production. We 
also study transcriptomic changes to assess potential mechanisms of Esm-1 in 
glomeruli.
RESULTS: In DKD-susceptible mice, Esm-1 inversely correlates with albuminuria 
and glomerular leukocyte infiltration. We show that overexpression of Esm-1 
reduces albuminuria and diabetes-induced podocyte injury, independent of changes 
in leukocyte infiltration. Using a complementary approach, we find that 
constitutive deletion of Esm-1 in DKD-resistant mice modestly increases the 
degree of diabetes-induced albuminuria versus wild-type controls. By glomerular 
RNAseq, we identify that Esm-1 attenuates expression of kidney disease-promoting 
and interferon (IFN)-related genes, including Ackr2 and Cxcl11.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that, in DKD-susceptible mice, Esm-1 protects 
against diabetes-induced albuminuria and podocytopathy, possibly through select 
IFN signaling. Companion studies in patients with diabetes suggest a role of 
Esm-1 in human DKD.

Aquaporins Display a Diversity in their Substrates.

Sachdeva R(1), Priyadarshini P(2), Gupta S(3).

Aquaporins constitute a family of transmembrane proteins that function to 
transport water and other small solutes across the cell membrane. Aquaporins 
family members are found in diverse life forms. Aquaporins share the common 
structural fold consisting of six transmembrane alpha helices with a central 
water-transporting channel. Four such monomers assemble together to form 
tetramers as their biological unit. Initially, aquaporins were discovered as 
water-transporting channels, but several studies supported their involvement in 
mediating the facilitated diffusion of different solutes. The so-called water 
channel is able to transport a variety of substrates ranging from a neutral 
molecule to a charged molecule or a small molecule to a bulky molecule or even a 
gas molecule. This article gives an overview of a diverse range of substrates 
conducted by aquaporin family members. Prime focus is on human aquaporins where 
aquaporins show a wide tissue distribution and substrate specificity leading to 
various physiological functions. This review also highlights the structural 
mechanisms leading to the transport of water and glycerol. More research is 
needed to understand how one common fold enables the aquaporins to transport an 
array of solutes.

Exploiting pretrained biochemical language models for targeted drug design.

Uludoğan G(1), Ozkirimli E(2), Ulgen KO(3), Karalı N(4), Özgür A(1).

MOTIVATION: The development of novel compounds targeting proteins of interest is 
one of the most important tasks in the pharmaceutical industry. Deep generative 
models have been applied to targeted molecular design and have shown promising 
results. Recently, target-specific molecule generation has been viewed as a 
translation between the protein language and the chemical language. However, 
such a model is limited by the availability of interacting protein-ligand pairs. 
On the other hand, large amounts of unlabelled protein sequences and chemical 
compounds are available and have been used to train language models that learn 
useful representations. In this study, we propose exploiting pretrained 
biochemical language models to initialize (i.e. warm start) targeted molecule 
generation models. We investigate two warm start strategies: (i) a one-stage 
strategy where the initialized model is trained on targeted molecule generation 
and (ii) a two-stage strategy containing a pre-finetuning on molecular 
generation followed by target-specific training. We also compare two decoding 
strategies to generate compounds: beam search and sampling.
RESULTS: The results show that the warm-started models perform better than a 
baseline model trained from scratch. The two proposed warm-start strategies 
achieve similar results to each other with respect to widely used metrics from 
benchmarks. However, docking evaluation of the generated compounds for a number 
of novel proteins suggests that the one-stage strategy generalizes better than 
the two-stage strategy. Additionally, we observe that beam search outperforms 
sampling in both docking evaluation and benchmark metrics for assessing compound 
quality.

Recent developments in stereo electroencephalography monitoring for epilepsy 
surgery.

Samanta D(1).

Recently the utilization of the stereo electroencephalography (SEEG) method has 
exploded globally. It is now the preferred method of intracranial monitoring for 
epilepsy. Since its inception, the basic tenet of the SEEG method remains the 
same: strategic implantation of intracerebral electrodes based on a hypothesis 
grounded on anatomo-electroclinical correlation, interpretation of interictal 
and ictal abnormalities, and formation of a surgical plan based on these data. 
However, there are recent advancements in all these domains-electrodes 
implantations, data interpretation, and therapeutic strategy- that can make the 
SEEG a more accessible and effective approach. In this narrative review, these 
newer developments are discussed and summarized. Regarding implantation, 
efficient commercial robotic systems are now increasingly available, which are 
also more accurate in implanting electrodes. In terms of ictal and interictal 
abnormalities, newer studies focused on correlating these abnormalities with 
pathological substrates and surgical outcomes and analyzing high-frequency 
oscillations and cortical-subcortical connectivity. These abnormalities can now 
be further quantified using advanced tools (spectrum, spatiotemporal, 
connectivity analysis, and machine learning algorithms) for objective and 
efficient interpretation. Another aspect of recent development is renewed 
interest in SEEG-based electrical stimulation mapping (ESM). The SEEG-ESM has 
been used in defining epileptogenic networks, mapping eloquent cortex (primarily 
language), and analyzing cortico-cortical evoked potential. Regarding 
SEEG-guided direct therapeutic strategy, several clinical studies evaluated the 
use of radiofrequency thermocoagulation. As the emerging SEEG-based diagnosis 
and therapeutics are better evolved, treatments aimed at specific epileptogenic 
networks without compromising the eloquent cortex will become more easily 
accessible to improve the lives of individuals with drug-resistant epilepsy 
(DRE).

A comparative evaluation of biomedical similar article recommendation.

Zhang L(1), Lu W(2), Chen H(3), Huang Y(4), Cheng Q(5).

BACKGROUND: Biomedical sciences, with their focus on human health and disease, 
have attracted unprecedented attention in the 21st century. The proliferation of 
biomedical sciences has also led to a large number of scientific articles being 
produced, which makes it difficult for biomedical researchers to find relevant 
articles and hinders the dissemination of valuable discoveries. To bridge this 
gap, the research community has initiated the article recommendation task, with 
the aim of recommending articles to biomedical researchers automatically based 
on their research interests. Over the past two decades, many recommendation 
methods have been developed. However, an algorithm-level comparison and rigorous 
evaluation of the most important methods on a shared dataset is still lacking.
METHOD: In this study, we first investigate 15 methods for automated article 
recommendation in the biomedical domain. We then conduct an empirical evaluation 
of the 15 methods, including six term-based methods, two word embedding methods, 
three sentence embedding methods, two document embedding methods, and two 
BERT-based methods. These methods are evaluated in two scenarios: 
article-oriented recommenders and user-oriented recommenders, with two publicly 
available datasets: TREC 2005 Genomics and RELISH, respectively.
RESULTS: Our experimental results show that the text representation models BERT 
and BioSenVec outperform many existing recommendation methods (e.g., BM25, PMRA, 
XPRC) and web-based recommendation systems (e.g., MScanner, MedlineRanker, 
BioReader) on both datasets regarding most of the evaluation metrics, and 
fine-tuning can improve the performance of the BERT-based methods.
CONCLUSIONS: Our comparison study is useful for researchers and practitioners in 
selecting the best modeling strategies for building article recommendation 
systems in the biomedical domain. The code and datasets are publicly available.

Enhancing heterologous expression of a key enzyme for the biosynthesis of 
2'-fucosyllactose.

Liu W(1)(2), Tang S(1)(2), Peng J(1)(2), Pan L(3), Wang J(3), Cheng H(1)(2), 
Chen Z(1)(2), Wang Y(1)(2), Zhou H(1)(2).

BACKGROUND: 2'-Fucosyllactose (2'-FL) is the most abundant human milk 
oligosaccharide (HMO) in human milk and has important physiological functions. 
The market demand of 2'-FL is continuing to grow, but high production cost has 
limited its availability. To solve the dilemma, biosynthesis of 2'-FL has been 
proposed and is considered the most promising pathway for massive production. 
α-1,2-Fucosyltransferase is one of the key elements involved in its 
biosynthesis, but the limited intracellular accumulation and unstable properties 
of α-1,2-fucosyltransferases when expressed in host strains have become a major 
hurdle for the effective biosynthesis of 2'-FL.
RESULTS: A combinatorial engineering strategy of synergic modification of 
ribosome binding site, fusion peptide and enzyme gene was leveraged to enhance 
the soluble expression of α-1,2-fucosyltransferases and promote enzyme activity. 
The preferable combination was to employ an optimized ribosome binding site 
region to drive 3 × FLAG as a fusion partner along with the 
α-1,2-fucosyltransferase for expression in Escherichia coli (DE3) PlySs, and 
protein yield and enzyme activity were remarkably improved by 11.51-fold and 
13.72-fold, respectively.
CONCLUSION: After finely tuning the synergy among different elements, the 
abundant protein yield and high enzyme activity confirmed that the drawbacks of 
heterologous expression in α-1,2-fucosyltransferase had been properly addressed. 
A suitable external environment further drives the efficient synthesis of 
α-1,2-fucosyltransferases. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a 
systematic and effective modification of α-1,2-fucosyltransferase expression, 
which could potentially serve as a guideline for industrial application. © 2022

MMP-12 polarizes neutrophil signalome towards an apoptotic signature.

Chalise U(1), Becirovic-Agic M(1), Konfrst SR(1), Rodriguez-Paar JR(1), Cook 
LM(2), Lindsey ML(3).

While macrophages are well-known to polarize across the inflammatory spectrum, 
neutrophils have only recently been found to activate in a similar fashion in 
response to pro- or anti-inflammatory stimuli. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-12 
mediates neutrophil physiology with direct signaling mechanisms yet to be 
investigated. We hypothesized MMP-12 may modify neutrophil signaling. Bone 
marrow neutrophils were stimulated with interleukin (IL-1β; pro-inflammatory), 
IL-4 (anti-inflammatory), or MMP-12. The secretome was mapped by multi-analyte 
profiling and intracellular signaling evaluated by array. IL-1β induced a 
cytokine-mediated inflammatory LPS-like signalome, with upregulation of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interferon gamma (IFNγ,15.2-fold,p = 0.001), 
chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1,8.4-fold,p = 0.005), and tumor necrosis 
factor alpha (TNFα,11.2-fold,p = 0.004). IL-4 induced strong intracellular 
signaling with upregulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 
(MEK1;1.9-fold,p = 0.0005) and downregulation of signal transducer and activator 
of transcription 4 (STAT4;0.77-fold,0.001). MMP-12 increased IL-4 secretion 
20-fold and induced a robust apoptotic neutrophil signalome with upregulation of 
forkhead box O1 (FOXO1;1.4-fold,p < 0.0001) and downregulation of WNT signaling 
with MMP-12 cleavage of the adherens junction components β-catenin, cahderin-3, 
and catenin-α2. In conclusion, neutrophils shifted phenotype by stimuli, with 
MMP-12 inducing a unique apoptotic signalome with higher resemblance to the 
anti-inflammatory signalome. SIGNIFICANCE: This study revealed that neutrophils 
demonstrate unique polarization signaling responses to specific stimuli, with 
the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-12 signalome showing similarity to the IL-4 
signalome. MMP-12 polarized neutrophils towards a strong apoptotic signature by 
upregulating FOXO1 and downregulating WNT signaling. Our results highlight that 
neutrophils display more plasticity than previously appreciated.

Collectively encoding protein properties enriches protein language models.

An J(1)(2), Weng X(3).

Pre-trained natural language processing models on a large natural language 
corpus can naturally transfer learned knowledge to protein domains by 
fine-tuning specific in-domain tasks. However, few studies focused on enriching 
such protein language models by jointly learning protein properties from 
strongly-correlated protein tasks. Here we elaborately designed a multi-task 
learning (MTL) architecture, aiming to decipher implicit structural and 
evolutionary information from three sequence-level classification tasks for 
protein family, superfamily and fold. Considering the co-existing contextual 
relevance between human words and protein language, we employed BERT, 
pre-trained on a large natural language corpus, as our backbone to handle 
protein sequences. More importantly, the encoded knowledge obtained in the MTL 
stage can be well transferred to more fine-grained downstream tasks of TAPE. 
Experiments on structure- or evolution-related applications demonstrate that our 
approach outperforms many state-of-the-art Transformer-based protein models, 
especially in remote homology detection.

Deep embedding and alignment of protein sequences.

Llinares-López F(1), Berthet Q(1), Blondel M(1), Teboul O(1), Vert JP(2).

Comment in
    Nat Methods. 2023 Jan;20(1):40-41.

Protein sequence alignment is a key component of most bioinformatics pipelines 
to study the structures and functions of proteins. Aligning highly divergent 
sequences remains, however, a difficult task that current algorithms often fail 
to perform accurately, leaving many proteins or open reading frames poorly 
annotated. Here we leverage recent advances in deep learning for language 
modeling and differentiable programming to propose DEDAL (deep embedding and 
differentiable alignment), a flexible model to align protein sequences and 
detect homologs. DEDAL is a machine learning-based model that learns to align 
sequences by observing large datasets of raw protein sequences and of correct 
alignments. Once trained, we show that DEDAL improves by up to two- or threefold 
the alignment correctness over existing methods on remote homologs and better 
discriminates remote homologs from evolutionarily unrelated sequences, paving 
the way to improvements on many downstream tasks relying on sequence alignment 
in structural and functional genomics.

BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) is influencing our society on many 
levels and has broad implications for the future practice of hematology and 
oncology. However, for many medical professionals and researchers, it often 
remains unclear what AI can and cannot do, and what are promising areas for a 
sensible application of AI in hematology and oncology. Finally, the limits and 
perils of using AI in oncology are not obvious to many healthcare professionals.
METHODS: In this article, we provide an expert-based consensus statement by the 
joint Working Group on "Artificial Intelligence in Hematology and Oncology" by 
the German Society of Hematology and Oncology (DGHO), the German Association for 
Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology (GMDS), and the Special Interest 
Group Digital Health of the German Informatics Society (GI). We provide a 
conceptual framework for AI in hematology and oncology.
RESULTS: First, we propose a technological definition, which we deliberately set 
in a narrow frame to mainly include the technical developments of the last 
ten years. Second, we present a taxonomy of clinically relevant AI systems, 
structured according to the type of clinical data they are used to analyze. 
Third, we show an overview of potential applications, including clinical, 
research, and educational environments with a focus on hematology and oncology.
CONCLUSION: Thus, this article provides a point of reference for hematologists 
and oncologists, and at the same time sets forth a framework for the further 
development and clinical deployment of AI in hematology and oncology in the 
future.

Structural and thermodynamic analyses of the β-to-α transformation in RfaH 
reveal principles of fold-switching proteins.

Zuber PK(1), Daviter T(2), Heißmann R(1), Persau U(1), Schweimer K(1), Knauer 
SH(1).

The two-domain protein RfaH, a paralog of the universally conserved NusG/Spt5 
transcription factors, is regulated by autoinhibition coupled to the reversible 
conformational switch of its 60-residue C-terminal Kyrpides, Ouzounis, Woese 
(KOW) domain between an α-hairpin and a β-barrel. In contrast, NusG/Spt5-KOW 
domains only occur in the β-barrel state. To understand the principles 
underlying the drastic fold switch in RfaH, we elucidated the thermodynamic 
stability and the structural dynamics of two RfaH- and four NusG/Spt5-KOW 
domains by combining biophysical and structural biology methods. We find that 
the RfaH-KOW β-barrel is thermodynamically less stable than that of most 
NusG/Spt5-KOWs and we show that it is in equilibrium with a globally unfolded 
species, which, strikingly, contains two helical regions that prime the 
transition toward the α-hairpin. Our results suggest that transiently structured 
elements in the unfolded conformation might drive the global folding transition 
in metamorphic proteins in general.

Functional MRI and electrical stimulation mapping for language localization: A 
comparative meta-analysis.

Holloway T(1), Leach JL(2), Tenney JR(3), Byars AW(3), Horn PS(3), Greiner 
HM(3), Mangano FT(4), Holland KD(3), Arya R(5).

OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the diagnostic 
validity of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) compared to electrical 
stimulation mapping (ESM) for pre-surgical language mapping.
METHODS: A structured literature search was performed and studies with 
electrode-level data comparing fMRI and ESM for language localization were 
analyzed. Outcome measures included pooled estimates of diagnostic odds ratio 
(DOR), sensitivity, and specificity. Sources of heterogeneity were explored with 
a meta-regression framework.
RESULTS: Nine studies were included in the analysis having 5-40 patients with 
mean age 11.3-43.4 years. Verb generation and picture naming were the most 
common fMRI tasks, while picture naming was the most common ESM task. 
Sensitivity (0.37-0.95), specificity (0.36-0.97), and DOR (1.9-44.6) for fMRI 
compared to ESM varied widely across studies with statistically significant 
heterogeneities. Pooled estimates were: sensitivity 0.71 (95% confidence 
interval 0.54, 0.83), specificity 0.74 (0.58, 0.85), and DOR 7.0 (3.5, 13.8), 
from a valid meta-analysis (area under the summary receiver-operating-curve 
0.78). fMRI was noted to have higher sensitivity in studies using higher maximal 
ESM currents. fMRI variables could not be included in the meta-regression 
because of substantial methodological differences among studies.
CONCLUSIONS: fMRI is moderately sensitive and moderately specific for language 
localization compared to ESM in well-designed studies. However, because the 
confidence limits for sensitivity and DOR are close to the line of no effect, 
and there is high unmeasured heterogeneity, fMRI cannot perhaps be used as the 
only modality for language localization to inform neurosurgical decisions at 
present.

Imaging peripheral lymphatic dysfunction in chronic conditions.

Sevick-Muraca EM(1), Fife CE(2), Rasmussen JC(1).

The lymphatics play important roles in chronic diseases/conditions that comprise 
the bulk of healthcare worldwide. Yet the ability to routinely image and 
diagnose lymphatic dysfunction, using commonly available clinical imaging 
modalities, has been lacking and as a result, the development of effective 
treatment strategies suffers. Nearly two decades ago, investigational 
near-infrared fluorescence lymphatic imaging and ICG lymphography were developed 
as routine diagnostic for clinically evaluating, quantifying, and treating 
lymphatic dysfunction in cancer-related and primary lymphedema, chronic venous 
disease, and more recently, autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorders. In this 
review, we provide an overview of what these non-invasive technologies have 
taught us about lymphatic (dys) function and anatomy in human studies and in 
corollary animal studies of human disease. We summarize by commenting on new 
impactful clinical frontiers in lymphatic science that remain to be facilitated 
by imaging.

Systematic Review of Endocan as a Potential Biomarker of COVID-19.

Khalaji A(1)(2), Amirkhani N(1), Sharifkashani S(1), Peiman S(3), Behnoush 
AH(1)(2).

Since the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, several 
biomarkers have been proposed to assess the diagnosis and prognosis of this 
disease. The present systematic review evaluated endocan (a marker of 
endothelial cell damage) as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for 
COVID-19. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase were searched for studies 
comparing circulating endocan levels between COVID-19 cases and controls, and/or 
different severities/complications of COVID-19. Eight studies (686 individuals) 
were included, from which four reported significantly higher levels of endocan 
in COVID-19 cases compared with healthy controls. More severe disease was also 
associated with higher endocan levels in some of the studies. Studies reported 
higher endocan levels in patients who died from COVID-19, were admitted to an 
intensive care unit, and had COVID-19-related complications. Endocan also acted 
as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker with different cut-offs. In conclusion, 
endocan could be a novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for COVID-19. 
Further studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to evaluate this role of 
endocan.

Analysis of Metabolic Regulators PGC1-α and PGC1-β in Oral Squamous Cell 
Carcinoma with and without Hyperglycemia.

Thamizhanambi TP(1), Rameshkumar A(1), Ramya R(2), Krishnan R(1), Dineshkumar 
T(1), Nandhini G(1).

AIM: To assess the expression of PGC1-α and PGC1-β in Oral squamous cell 
carcinoma in the presence and absence of hyperglycemia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fresh tissue samples were collected from 14 well 
differentiated OSCC patients with hyperglycemia, 14 OSCC patients without 
hyperglycemia  and 14 healthy controls and subjected to quantitative real-time 
PCR to assess expression of PGC1-α and PGC1-β. The relative gene expression of 
PGC1-α and PGC1-β was calculated using the double delta Ct method. A two-fold 
difference was defined as over or under- expression.  To further evaluate 
clinicopathological association, Independent t-test was employed.
RESULTS: The expression of both PGC1-α and PGC1-β were increased in OSCC 
patients when compared to healthy controls and similar findings were observed on 
calculating the fold change healthy controls and OSCC study groups. On assessing 
the expression of target genes within study groups, they did not present with 
significant fold change and the hyperglycemic status of the individual did not 
contribute to the expression of the target genes as P value obtained for PGC1-α 
and PGC1-β were >0.05.
CONCLUSION: The hyperglycemic status of the individual does not influence the 
expression of PGC1-α and PGC1-β in OSCC tissues and the cause for 
over-expression of the study targets in OSCC tissues must be further evaluated 
 to assess their potential as possible candidates for targeted therapy in OSCC 
patients.

Eggshell membranes (ESM) contain 90% protein, 3% lipids, 2% sugars, and small 
amounts of minerals such as calcium and magnesium. Of the 90% of proteins 
present, 472 proteins species have been identified. ESM provide the initial 
mineralization platform for eggshell formation, and can be used for to produce 
adsorbents, cosmetics, and medical products because of their special physical 
structure and chemical composition. The special physical structure of the 
eggshell membrane, with disulfide bonds between and within the protein molecules 
and the cross-linking of lysine-derived and heterochain chains between the 
eggshell membrane, makes the membrane very difficult to dissolve, with a maximum 
solubility rate of only 62%. Also, the insolubility of ESM limits its 
development and use also any related research. Based on the physical structure 
and chemical composition of the eggshell membrane, this paper reviews the latest 
research on eggshell membrane separation and membrane protein solubilization to 
provide a reference for promoting the separation, dissolution, and rational 
development and use of the avian eggshell membrane.

C-type lectin-(like) fold - Protein-protein interaction patterns and 
utilization.

Dohnálek J(1), Skálová T(2).

The C-type lectin-like fold (CTL fold) is a building block of many proteins, 
including saccharide-binding lectins, natural killer cell receptors, macrophage 
mannose receptor, selectins, collectins, snake venoms and others. Some are 
important players in innate immunity and are involved in the first-line response 
to virally infected cells or cancer cells, some play a role in antimicrobial 
defense, and some are potential targets for fight against problems connected 
with allergies, obesity, and autoimmunity. The structure of a CTL domain 
typically contains two α-helices, two small β-sheets and a long surface loop, 
with two or three disulfide bridges stabilizing the structure. This small domain 
is often involved in interactions with a target molecule, however, utilizing 
varied parts of the domain surface, with or without structural modifications. 
More than 500 three-dimensional structures of CTL fold-containing proteins are 
available in the Protein Data Bank, including a significant number of complexes 
with their key interacting partners (protein:protein complexes). The amount of 
available structural data enables a detailed analysis of the rules of 
interaction patterns utilized in activation, inhibition, attachment, and other 
pathways or functionalities. Interpretation of known CTL receptor structures and 
all other CTL-containing proteins and complexes with described three-dimensional 
structures, complemented with sequence/structure/interaction correlation 
analysis, offers a comprehensive view of the rules of interaction patterns of 
the CTL fold. The results are of value for prediction of interaction behavior of 
so far not understood CTL-containing proteins and development of new protein 
binders based on this fold, with applications in biomedicine or biotechnologies. 
It follows from the available structural data that almost the whole surface of 
the CTL fold is utilized in protein:protein interactions, with the heaviest 
frequency of utilization in the canonical interaction region. The individual 
categories of interactions differ in the interface buildup strategy. The 
strongest CTL binders rely on interfaces with large interaction area, presence 
of hydrophobic core, or high surface complementarity. The typical interaction 
surfaces of the fold are not conserved in amino acid sequence and can be 
utilized in design of new binders for biotechnological applications.

AMPDeep: hemolytic activity prediction of antimicrobial peptides using transfer 
learning.

Salem M(#)(1), Keshavarzi Arshadi A(#)(2), Yuan JS(3).

BACKGROUND: Deep learning's automatic feature extraction has proven to give 
superior performance in many sequence classification tasks. However, deep 
learning models generally require a massive amount of data to train, which in 
the case of Hemolytic Activity Prediction of Antimicrobial Peptides creates a 
challenge due to the small amount of available data.
RESULTS: Three different datasets for hemolysis activity prediction of 
therapeutic and antimicrobial peptides are gathered and the AMPDeep pipeline is 
implemented for each. The result demonstrate that AMPDeep outperforms the 
previous works on all three datasets, including works that use physicochemical 
features to represent the peptides or those who solely rely on the sequence and 
use deep learning to learn representation for the peptides. Moreover, a combined 
dataset is introduced for hemolytic activity prediction to address the problem 
of sequence similarity in this domain. AMPDeep fine-tunes a large transformer 
based model on a small amount of peptides and successfully leverages the 
patterns learned from other protein and peptide databases to assist hemolysis 
activity prediction modeling.
CONCLUSIONS: In this work transfer learning is leveraged to overcome the 
challenge of small data and a deep learning based model is successfully adopted 
for hemolysis activity classification of antimicrobial peptides. This model is 
first initialized as a protein language model which is pre-trained on masked 
amino acid prediction on many unlabeled protein sequences in a self-supervised 
manner. Having done so, the model is fine-tuned on an aggregated dataset of 
labeled peptides in a supervised manner to predict secretion. Through transfer 
learning, hyper-parameter optimization and selective fine-tuning, AMPDeep is 
able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on three hemolysis datasets using 
only the sequence of the peptides. This work assists the adoption of large 
sequence-based models for peptide classification and modeling tasks in a 
practical manner.

Cytotoxicity of phenylpironetin analogs and the metabolic fate of pironetin and 
phenylpironetin.

Noman MAA(1), Huang DS(1), Coulup SK(1), Syeda SS(1), Henry(1), Wong L(1), Georg 
GI(2).

To improve pironetin's metabolic stability we prepared four analogs by replacing 
its C12-14 segment with an aryl group. The antiproliferative activity of phenyl 
analog 4 was reduced two-fold and dihydroxy-4-fluorophenyl analog 5 was slightly 
more effective against OVCAR5 and A2780 ovarian cancer cell lines compared with 
the parent compound pironetin (1). The activity of 4-fluorophenyl analog 6 was 
reduced 3-fold in both cell lines. The activity of 7-O-methyl analog 7 was 
reduced 36-fold in OVCAR5 cells and 47-fold and A2780 cells, compared with 
pironetin. Phenylpironetin (4) was rapidly metabolized by mouse and human liver 
microsomes. We identified 17 human metabolites for phenyl analog 4 and 14 human 
metabolites for pironetin. Metabolism occurred at the C12-13 moiety, the 
α,β-unsaturated lactone and the side chains of the molecules (C6-C11 segments). 
The significant extent of oxidative metabolism suggests that it may not be 
possible to attain a metabolically stable pironetin analog by structural 
modifications of the parent compound.

Premature discontinuation among individuals with epilepsy participating in 
epilepsy self-management research interventions.

MR(6), Jobst BC(7), Johnson EK(8), Kiriakopoulos ET(9), Rentsch J(10), Shegog 
R(11), Spruill TM(12), Sajatovic M(13).

OBJECTIVE: The Managing Epilepsy Well (MEW) Network conducts epilepsy 
self-management (ESM) intervention development, testing, and archival clinical 
trials data analyses in the MEW Network Integrated Database (MEW-DB). However, 
not all trial participants fully benefit from ESM due to prematurely 
discontinuing program participation. This analysis sought to identify 
demographic and clinical predictors of premature discontinuation (PD) of ESM 
interventions available in the MEW-DB.
METHODS: Data from prior studies were included if: 1) they were prospective 
trials testing an ESM intervention, 2) included baseline assessment and at least 
one post-intervention assessment, and 3) included data on PD. Dependent 
variables were all-cause PD, categorized as a binary variable (yes/no) and time 
to PD for the intervals between baseline and follow-up visit 1 (V1; 
approximately week 12) and visit two (V2; approximately week 24). Multivariable 
Cox proportional hazard models were used to identify factors affecting PD 
time-point. Explanatory variables included age, gender, race/ethnicity, 
education, employment, income, marital status, psychiatric comorbidities, 
depressive severity, anxiety symptoms, self-efficacy, number of anti-seizure 
medications (ASMs), health status, seizure frequency, and study design.
RESULTS: Six prior MEW-DB studies were included, consisting of 627 people, where 
624 were assigned to ESM or to control. PD among randomized individuals was 14.3 
% by V1 and 15.7 % by V2. Predictors for V1 PD were treatment (ESM) vs. control 
arm, more severe depressive symptoms and having schizophrenia. Predictors for V2 
PD were younger age, white race, more severe depressive symptoms and having 
schizophrenia.
SIGNIFICANCE: While ESM approaches can improve multiple health outcomes among 
people with epilepsy, nearly one in six individuals prematurely discontinues 
their program. These findings suggest that ESM interventionists need to be 
particularly attentive to program retention over the first 3 months after ESM 
initiation. Younger people with epilepsy, those who self-identify as white, 
those with schizophrenia, and/or more severe depressive symptoms may need 
additional support for engagement.

Parameter Screening and Optimization for a Polycaprolactone-Based GTR/GBR 
Membrane Using Taguchi Design.

Kalluri L(1), Duan Y(1).

Our objective was to determine and optimize the significant parameters affecting 
mechanical properties and mean fiber diameter (MFD) of a novel GTR/GBR membrane 
composed of polycaprolactone (PCL) and chicken eggshell membrane (ESM). For 
this, we prepared electrospun membrane specimens (n = 16) with varying 
concentrations of PCL, ESM, nano-hydroxyapatite (HAp), and altered 
electrospinning parameters as generated by DOE++ software. After the 
determination of MFD and mechanical properties for all specimens, Taguchi 
orthogonal array L8 design was used to screen significant factors affecting the 
MFD and mechanical properties. PCL wt%, ESM wt%, HAp wt%, applied voltage (AV), 
flow rate (FR), and spinneret-collector distance (SCD) were the independent 
variables investigated. The response variables analyzed were MFD, tensile 
strength (TS), and elastic modulus. ANOVA outlined ESM wt%, HAp wt%, AV, FR, 
SCD, and an interactive effect between PCL wt% and AV to be the significant 
factors affecting modulus values of an electrospun PCL/ESM membrane (p < 0.05). 
Furthermore, concentrations of PCL and ESM were the significant factors 
affecting MFD (p < 0.05) and there were no significant factors affecting the TS 
values. Optimization using DOE++ software predicted that the maximal TS of 3.125 
MPa, modulus of 278.168 MPa, and MFD of 882.75 nm could be achieved.

Antibody apparent solubility prediction from sequence by transfer learning.

Feng J(1), Jiang M(2), Shih J(1), Chai Q(1).

Developing therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for the subcutaneous 
administration requires identifying mAbs with superior solubility that are 
amenable for high-concentration formulation. However, experimental screening is 
often material and labor intensive. Here, we present a strategy (named 
solPredict) that employs the embeddings from pretrained protein language 
modeling to predict the apparent solubility of mAbs in histidine (pH 6.0) 
buffer. A dataset of 220 diverse, in-house mAbs were used for model training and 
hyperparameter tuning through 5-fold cross validation. solPredict achieves high 
correlation with experimental solubility on an independent test set of 40 mAbs. 
Importantly, solPredict performs well for both IgG1 and IgG4 subclasses despite 
the distinct solubility behaviors. This approach eliminates the need of 3D 
structure modeling of mAbs, descriptor computation, and expert-crafted input 
features. The minimal computational expense of solPredict enables rapid, 
large-scale, and high-throughput screening of mAbs using sequence information 
alone during early antibody discovery.

Optimization of Transcription Factor Genetic Circuits.

Frank SA(1).

Transcription factors (TFs) affect the production of mRNAs. In essence, the TFs 
form a large computational network that controls many aspects of cellular 
function. This article introduces a computational method to optimize TF 
networks. The method extends recent advances in artificial neural network 
optimization. In a simple example, computational optimization discovers a 
four-dimensional TF network that maintains a circadian rhythm over many days, 
successfully buffering strong stochastic perturbations in molecular dynamics and 
entraining to an external day-night signal that randomly turns on and off at 
intervals of several days. This work highlights the similar challenges in 
understanding how computational TF and neural networks gain information and 
improve performance.

The accuracy of protein structures in solution determined by AlphaFold and NMR.

Fowler NJ(1), Williamson MP(2).

In the recent Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) competition, 
AlphaFold2 performed outstandingly. Its worst predictions were for nuclear 
magnetic resonance (NMR) structures, which has two alternative explanations: 
either the NMR structures were poor, implying that Alpha-Fold may be more 
accurate than NMR, or there is a genuine difference between crystal and solution 
structures. Here, we use the program Accuracy of NMR Structures Using RCI and 
Rigidity (ANSURR), which measures the accuracy of solution structures, and show 
that one of the NMR structures was indeed poor. We then compare Alpha-Fold 
predictions to NMR structures and show that Alpha-Fold tends to be more accurate 
than NMR ensembles. There are, however, some cases where the NMR ensembles are 
more accurate. These tend to be dynamic structures, where Alpha-Fold had low 
confidence. We suggest that Alpha-Fold could be used as the model for 
NMR-structure refinements and that Alpha-Fold structures validated by ANSURR may 
require no further refinement.

Bariatric Surgery-induced High-density Lipoprotein Functionality Enhancement Is 
Associated With Reduced Inflammation.

Adam S(1)(2), Ho JH(1)(3), Liu Y(1), Siahmansur T(1), Siddals K(1), Iqbal 
Z(1)(3), Azmi S(1)(3), Senapati S(4), New J(5), Jeziorska M(1), Ammori BJ(1)(5), 
Syed AA(1)(5), Donn R(1), Malik RA(1)(6), Durrington PN(1), Soran H(1)(3).

BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence suggests an association between impaired 
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) functionality and cardiovascular disease (CVD). 
HDL is essential for reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) and reduces 
inflammation and oxidative stress principally via paraoxonase-1 (PON1). RCT 
depends on HDL's capacity to accept cholesterol (cholesterol efflux capacity 
[CEC]) and active transport through ATP-binding cassette (ABC) A1, G1, and 
scavenger receptor-B1 (SR-B1). We have studied the impact of Roux-en-Y gastric 
bypass (RYGB) in morbidly obese subjects on RCT and HDL functionality.
METHODS: Biomarkers associated with increased CVD risk including tumour necrosis 
factor-α (TNF-α), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), myeloperoxidase 
mass (MPO), PON1 activity, and CEC in vitro were measured in 44 patients before 
and 6 and 12 months after RYGB. Overweight but otherwise healthy (mean body mass 
index [BMI] 28 kg/m2) subjects acted as controls. Twelve participants also 
underwent gluteal subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies before and 6 months after 
RYGB for targeted gene expression (ABCA1, ABCG1, SR-B1, TNF-α) and histological 
analysis (adipocyte size, macrophage density, TNF-α immunostaining).
RESULTS: Significant (P < 0.05) improvements in BMI, HDL-cholesterol, hsCRP, 
TNF-α, MPO mass, PON1 activity, and CEC in vitro were observed after RYGB. ABCG1 
(fold-change, 2.24; P = 0.005) and ABCA1 gene expression increased significantly 
(fold-change, 1.34; P = 0.05). Gluteal fat adipocyte size (P < 0.0001), 
macrophage density (P = 0.0067), and TNF-α immunostaining (P = 0.0425) were 
reduced after RYBG and ABCG1 expression correlated inversely with TNF-α 
immunostaining (r = -0.71; P = 0.03).
CONCLUSION: RYGB enhances HDL functionality in association with a reduction in 
adipose tissue and systemic inflammation.

Tubulin expression and modification in heart failure with preserved ejection 
fraction (HFpEF).

Schulz L(1), Werner S(1), Böttner J(1), Adams V(2)(3), Lurz P(1), Besler C(1), 
Thiele H(1), Büttner P(4).

Diastolic dysfunction in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) 
is characterised by increased left ventricular stiffness and impaired active 
relaxation. Underpinning pathomechanisms are incompletely understood. Cardiac 
hypertrophy and end stage heart disease are associated with alterations in the 
cardiac microtubule (MT) network. Increased amounts and modifications of 
α-tubulin associate with myocardial stiffness. MT alterations in HFpEF have not 
been analysed yet. Using ZSF1 obese rats (O-ZSF1), a validated HFpEF model, we 
characterised MT-modifying enzymes, quantity and tyrosination/detyrosination 
pattern of α-tubulin at 20 and 32 weeks of age. In the left ventricle of O-ZSF1, 
α-tubulin concentration (20 weeks: 1.5-fold, p = 0.019; 32 weeks: 1.7-fold, 
p = 0.042) and detyrosination levels (20 weeks: 1.4-fold, p = 0.013; 32 weeks: 
1.3-fold, p = 0.074) were increased compared to lean ZSF1 rats. 
Tyrosination/α-tubulin ratio was lower in O-ZSF1 (20 weeks: 0.8-fold, p = 0.020; 
32 weeks: 0.7-fold, p = 0.052). Expression of α-tubulin modifying enzymes was 
comparable. These results reveal new alterations in the left ventricle in HFpEF 
that are detectable during early (20 weeks) and late (32 weeks) progression. We 
suppose that these alterations contribute to diastolic dysfunction in HFpEF and 
that reestablishment of MT homeostasis might represent a new target for 
pharmacological interventions.

Solomon T(2)(4), Simmerman R(1), Kauffman T(2)(4), Gallagher DT(2)(5), Orban 
J(6)(7), Bryan PN(8)(9).

To better understand how amino acid sequence encodes protein structure, we 
engineered mutational pathways that connect three common folds (3α, β-grasp, and 
α/β-plait). The structures of proteins at high sequence-identity intersections 
in the pathways (nodes) were determined using NMR spectroscopy and analyzed for 
stability and function. To generate nodes, the amino acid sequence encoding a 
smaller fold is embedded in the structure of an ~50% larger fold and a new 
sequence compatible with two sets of native interactions is designed. This 
generates protein pairs with a 3α or β-grasp fold in the smaller form but an 
α/β-plait fold in the larger form. Further, embedding smaller antagonistic folds 
creates critical states in the larger folds such that single amino acid 
substitutions can switch both their fold and function. The results help explain 
the underlying ambiguity in the protein folding code and show that new protein 
structures can evolve via abrupt fold switching.

Intervention initiatives to raise young people's interest and participation in 
STEM.

Schneider B(1), Chen IC(1), Bradford L(1), Bartz K(1).

For nearly a decade, two science interventions anchored in project-based 
learning (PBL) principles have been shown to increase student science learning 
in 3rd grade and high school physical science classes. Both interventions 
employed a randomized control trial of several thousand students (N = 3,271 in 
3rd grade and N = 4,238 in 10th, 11th, and 12th grades). Incorporating a rich 
background of research studies and reports, the two interventions are based on 
the ideas of PBL as well as the National Academies of Science's publications, 
including how children learn; how science learning and instruction can be 
transformed; and the performance expectations for science learning articulated 
in the Next Generation of Science Standards. Results show significant positive 
increases in student academic, social, and emotional learning in both elementary 
and secondary school. These findings can be traced, in part, to carefully 
crafted experiential participatory activities and high-quality instructional 
materials which act as strong facilitators for knowledge acquisition and use. 
Reviewing the innovations undertaken by these two interventions, this article 
describes the importance of studying social and emotional factors 'in situ', 
using the Experience Sampling Method (ESM), that can motivate and engage 
students in science learning in both elementary and secondary school. Using 
these 'in situ' data collection (N = 596 students in 3rd and N = 1412 students 
in 10th, 11th, and 12th grades) along with case studies and repeated measures 
analysis gave deep insights into emotional and social development for young 
children and adolescents. These methods should continue to be considered when 
trying to understand key factors of improving engagement in science.

Enhancement of Fungal Enzyme Production by Radio-Frequency Electromagnetic 
Fields.

HY(1), Kim NY(1)(3), Park G(2)(4).

Enzyme production by microorganisms on an industrial scale has demonstrated 
technical bottlenecks, such as low efficiency in enzyme expression and 
extracellular secretion. In this study, as a potential tool for overcoming these 
technical limits, radio-frequency electromagnetic field (RF-EMF) exposure was 
examined for its possibility to enhance production of an enzyme, α-amylase, in a 
filamentous fungus, Aspergillus oryzae. The RF-EMF perfectly resonated at 2 GHz 
with directivity radiation pattern and peak gain of 0.5 dB (0.01 Watt). Total 
protein concentration and activity of α-amylase measured in media were about 
1.5-3-fold higher in the RF-EMF exposed (10 min) sample than control (no RF-EMF) 
during incubation (the highest increase after 16 h). The level of α-amylase mRNA 
in cells was approximately 2-8-fold increased 16 and 24 h after RF-EMF exposure 
for 10 min. An increase in vesicle accumulation within fungal hyphae and the 
transcription of some genes involved in protein cellular trafficking was 
observed in RF-EMF-exposed samples. Membrane potential was not changed, but the 
intracellular Ca2+ level was elevated after RF-EMF exposure. Our results suggest 
that RF-EMF can increase the extracellular level of fungal total proteins and 
α-amylase activity and the intracellular level of Ca2+.

Rosemary essential oil and its components 1,8-cineole and α-pinene induce 
ROS-dependent lethality and ROS-independent virulence inhibition in Candida 
albicans.

Shahina Z(1), Al Homsi R(2), Price JDW(1), Whiteway M(2), Sultana T(1), Dahms 
TES(1).

The essential oil from Rosmarinus officinalis L., a composite mixture of 
plant-derived secondary metabolites, exhibits antifungal activity against 
virulent candidal species. Here we report the impact of rosemary oil and two of 
its components, the monoterpene α-pinene and the monoterpenoid 1,8-cineole, 
against Candida albicans, which induce ROS-dependent cell death at high 
concentrations and inhibit hyphal morphogenesis and biofilm formation at lower 
concentrations. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (100% inhibition) for both 
rosemary oil and 1,8-cineole were 4500 μg/ml and 3125 μg/ml for α-pinene, with 
the two components exhibiting partial synergy (FICI = 0.55 ± 0.07). At MIC and 
1/2 MIC, rosemary oil and its components induced a generalized cell wall stress 
response, causing damage to cellular and organelle membranes, along with 
elevated chitin production and increased cell surface adhesion and elasticity, 
leading to complete vacuolar segregation, mitochondrial depolarization, elevated 
reactive oxygen species, microtubule dysfunction, and cell cycle arrest mainly 
at the G1/S phase, consequently triggering cell death. Interestingly, the same 
oils at lower fractional MIC (1/8-1/4) inhibited virulence traits, including 
reduction of mycelium (up to 2-fold) and biofilm (up to 4-fold) formation, 
through a ROS-independent mechanism.

SEMA: Antigen B-cell conformational epitope prediction using deep transfer 
learning.

One of the primary tasks in vaccine design and development of immunotherapeutic 
drugs is to predict conformational B-cell epitopes corresponding to primary 
antibody binding sites within the antigen tertiary structure. To date, multiple 
approaches have been developed to address this issue. However, for a wide range 
of antigens their accuracy is limited. In this paper, we applied the transfer 
learning approach using pretrained deep learning models to develop a model that 
predicts conformational B-cell epitopes based on the primary antigen sequence 
and tertiary structure. A pretrained protein language model, ESM-1v, and an 
inverse folding model, ESM-IF1, were fine-tuned to quantitatively predict 
antibody-antigen interaction features and distinguish between epitope and 
non-epitope residues. The resulting model called SEMA demonstrated the best 
performance on an independent test set with ROC AUC of 0.76 compared to 
peer-reviewed tools. We show that SEMA can quantitatively rank the 
immunodominant regions within the SARS-CoV-2 RBD domain. SEMA is available at

P2Y(2)R-Mediated PAK1 Activation Is Involved in ESM-1 Overexpression in 
RT-R-MDA-MB-231 through FoxO1 Regulation.

Jin H(1), Kim HJ(1)(2).

ESM-1, overexpressed in several cancer types, is a potential cancer diagnostic 
and prognostic indicator. In our previous study, we determined that RT-R-TNBC 
cells were more aggressive than TNBC cells, and this difference was associated 
with ESM-1 overexpression. However, the mechanism explaining upregulated ESM-1 
expression in RT-R-TNBC cells compared to TNBC cells was unclear. Therefore, we 
aimed to identify the mechanism by which ESM-1 is overexpressed in 
RT-R-MDA-MB-231 cells. RT-R-MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with various ESM-1 
transcription factor inhibitors, and only the FoxO1 inhibitor downregulated 
ESM-1 expression. FoxO1 nuclear localization was modulated by JNK and p38 MAPKs, 
which were differentially regulated by PKC, PDK1 and PAK1. PAK1 profoundly 
modulated JNK and p38 MAPKs, whereas PKC and PDK1 affected only p38 MAPK. P2Y2R 
activated by ATP, which is highly released from RT-R-BC cells, was involved in 
PAK1 activation, subsequent JNK and p38 MAPK activation, FoxO1 induction, and 
ESM-1 expression in RT-R-MDA-MB-231 cells. These findings suggest for the first 
time that ESM-1 was overexpressed in RT-R-MDA-MB-231 cells and regulated through 
the P2Y2R-PAK1-FoxO1 signaling pathway.

Scaling Catalytic Contributions of Small Self-Cleaving Ribozymes.

Egger M(1), Bereiter R(1), Mair S(1), Micura R(1).

Nucleolytic ribozymes utilize general acid-base catalysis to perform 
phosphodiester cleavage. In most ribozyme classes, a conserved active site 
guanosine is positioned to act as general base, thereby activating the 2'-OH 
group to attack the scissile phosphate (γ-catalysis). Here, we present an atomic 
mutagenesis study for the pistol ribozyme class. Strikingly, "general base 
knockout" by replacement of the guanine N1 atom by carbon results in only 
2.7-fold decreased rate. Therefore, the common view that γ-catalysis critically 
depends on the N1 moiety becomes challenged. For pistol ribozymes we found that 
γ-catalysis is subordinate in overall catalysis, made up by two other catalytic 
factors (α and δ). Our approach allows scaling of the different catalytic 
contributions (α, β, γ, δ) with unprecedented precision and paves the way for a 
thorough mechanistic understanding of nucleolytic ribozymes with active site 
guanines.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is characterized by neutrophil-dominated 
inflammation resulting in emphysema. The cholesterol-rich neutrophil outer 
plasma membrane plays a central role in adhesion and subsequent transmigration 
to underlying tissues. This study aimed to investigate mechanisms of increased 
neutrophil adhesion in AATD and whether alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) augmentation 
therapy abrogates this effect. Plasma and blood neutrophils were donated by 
healthy controls (n = 20), AATD (n = 30), and AATD patients after AAT 
augmentation therapy (n = 6). Neutrophil membrane protein expression was 
investigated using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The effect of 
once-weekly intravenous AAT augmentation therapy was assessed by calcium 
fluorometric, μ-calpain, and cell adhesion assays. Decreased neutrophil plasma 
membrane cholesterol content (P = 0.03), yet increased abundance of integrin α-M 
(fold change 1.91), integrin α-L (fold change 3.76), and cytoskeletal adaptor 
proteins including talin-1 (fold change 4.04) were detected on AATD neutrophil 
plasma membrane fractions. The described inflammatory induced structural changes 
were a result of a more than twofold increased cytosolic calcium concentration 
(P = 0.02), leading to significant calcium-dependent μ-calpain activity 
(3.5-fold change; P = 0.005), resulting in proteolysis of the membrane 
cholesterol trafficking protein caveolin-1. Treatment of AAT-deficient 
individuals with AAT augmentation therapy resulted in increased caveolin-1 and 
membrane cholesterol content (111.8 ± 15.5 vs. 64.18 ± 7.8 μg/2 × 107 cells 
before and after treatment, respectively; P = 0.02), with concurrent decreased 
neutrophil integrin expression and adhesion. Results demonstrate an auxiliary 
benefit of AAT augmentation therapy, evident by a decrease in circulating 
inflammation and controlled neutrophil adhesion.

Vocal fold fibroblasts promote angiogenesis in vocal fold leukoplakia by 
secreting pro-angiogenic factors.

Chu Y(1), Fang Y(1), Wu H(1), Chen J(2), Cheng L(3).

OBJECTIVE: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have been reported to play an 
essential role in tumor angiogenesis and progression. In this study, we aimed to 
investigate the impact of vocal fold leukoplakia-associated fibroblasts (VFLFs) 
on the angiogenesis process in vocal fold leukoplakia (VFL) and their potential 
secretions of proangiogenic factors.
METHODS: A total of 160 lesions (86 laryngeal carcinoma, 67 vocal fold 
leukoplakia, 7 vocal fold polyp) were detected under narrow band imaging (NBI) 
mode to evaluate the relationship between pathology and intraepithelial 
papillary capillary loop (IPCL) grades. We characterized immortalized vocal fold 
CAFs, VFLFs, normal fibroblasts (NFs) cell lines using immunofluorescence 
cytochemistry and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). 
The effects of fibroblast conditioned media (CM) on the proliferative, migrating 
and tube formation capacity of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) 
were investigated using the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, wound healing 
assay, transwell migration experiment and Matrigel tube formation experiment. 
The expression levels of proangiogenic factors in CAFs, VFLFs, and NFs were 
evaluated by antibody microarray and RT-qPCR.
RESULTS: NBI images depicted that angiogenesis was abnormally activated during 
laryngeal tumorigenesis. Both CAF and VFLF expressed Vimentin, alpha-smooth 
muscle actin (α-SMA) and fibroblast activation protein (FAP). NF expressed 
Vimentin and α-SMA, but not FAP. The PCR results showed that mRNA expression 
levels of Vimentin, α-SMA and FAP in CAFs and VFLFs were significantly increased 
than those in NFs. CAF-CM and VFLF-CM promoted the proliferative, migrating, and 
tube formation ability of HUVECs. Secretome profiling of fibroblasts by antibody 
microarray demonstrated that VFLFs secreted significantly more vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiogenin, bFGF and HGF than NFs.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we demonstrated that VEGF, angiogenin, bFGF and HGF 
derived from VFLFs may play crucial roles in the angiogenesis process of 
laryngeal premalignant and malignant lesions. This may contribute to the 
exploitation of novel therapeutic strategies for VFL.

Personalized Prediction of Behaviors and Experiences: An Idiographic 
Person-Situation Test.

Beck ED(1)(2), Jackson JJ(3).

A longstanding goal of psychology is to predict the things that people do and 
feel, but tools to accurately predict future behaviors and experiences remain 
elusive. In the present study, we used intensive longitudinal data (N = 104 
college-age adults at a midwestern university; total assessments = 5,971) and 
three machine-learning approaches to investigate the degree to which three 
future behaviors and experiences-loneliness, procrastination, and studying-could 
be predicted from past psychological (i.e., personality and affective states), 
situational (i.e., objective situations and psychological situation cues), and 
time (i.e., trends, diurnal cycles, time of day, and day of the week) phenomena 
from an idiographic, person-specific perspective. Rather than pitting persons 
against situations, such an approach allows psychological phenomena, situations, 
and time to jointly predict future behaviors and experiences. We found (a) a 
striking degree of prediction accuracy across participants, (b) that a majority 
of participants' future behaviors are predicted by both person and situation 
features, and (c) that the most important features vary greatly across people.

The chicken eggshell membrane: a versatile, sustainable, biological material for 
translational biomedical applications.

Mensah RA(1), Salim K(1), Peszko K(1), Diop S(1), Wong TH(1), Chau DY(1).

Naturally derived materials are often preferred over synthetic materials for 
biomedical applications due to their innate biological characteristics, relative 
availability, sustainability, and agreement with conscientious end-users. The 
chicken eggshell membrane (ESM) is an abundant resource with a defined 
structural profile, chemical composition, and validated morphological and 
mechanical characteristics. These unique properties have not only allowed the 
ESM to be exploited within the food industry but has also led to it be 
considered for other novel translational applications such as tissue 
regeneration and replacement, wound healing and drug delivery. However, 
challenges still exist in order to enhance the native ESM (nESM): the need to 
improve its mechanical properties, the ability to combine/join fragments of ESM 
together, and the addition or incorporation of drugs/growth factors to advance 
its therapeutic capacity. This review article provides a succinct background to 
the nESM, its extraction, isolation, and consequent physical, mechanical and 
biological characterisation including possible approaches to enhancement. 
Moreover, it also highlights current applications of the ESM in regenerative 
medicine and hints at future novel applications in which this novel biomaterial 
could be exploited to beneficial use.

Healthy pediatric platelets are moderately hyporeactive in comparison with 
adults' platelets.

Ponomarenko EA(1)(2), Ignatova AA(1)(3), Polokhov DM(1), Khismatullina RD(1), 
Kurilo DS(1), Shcherbina A(1), Zharkov PA(1), Maschan AA(1), Novichkova GA(1), 
Panteleev MA(1)(3)(4).

Studies on platelet function in children older than neonatal period are few and 
their results are controversial. The pediatric platelets were alternatively 
reported to be more active or less active than adults' ones. We compared 
platelet function in the several age groups of children to adults and evaluated 
the age when platelet function reaches the adults' status. The study included 76 
healthy children and 49 healthy adult volunteers. Types of platelet activation 
used included: collagen-related peptide (CRP) and PAR-1 activating peptide 
SFLLRN; SFLLRN, PAR-4 activating peptide AYPGKF and adenosine diphosphate (ADP); 
ADP. The parameters determined included forward (FSC) and side scatter (SSC), 
CD42b, CD61, CD62P, PAC-1, annexin V binding and mepacrine release levels. 
Resting pediatric platelets were similar to adults' platelets except for 
1.2-fold decreased FSC and dense granules volume in youngest children, and 
2.5-fold increased annexin V level in children aged 1-10 years. After CRP+SFLLRN 
stimulation, pediatric platelets had a 1.2-fold lower alpha- and 1.1-fold lower 
dense granule release than adults. For SFLLRN+AYPGKF+ADP stimulation, this was 
observed only for youngest children. The response to ADP stimulation was 
identical for pediatric platelets and adults. Pediatric platelets have lower 
granular release than adults' platelets, which persists until the age of 18.

Canonical NF-κB signaling pathway and GRO-α/CXCR2 axis are activated in 
unruptured intracranial aneurysm patients.

Kamińska J(1), Tylicka M(2), Dymicka-Piekarska V(3), Mariak Z(4), 
Matowicka-Karna J(3), Koper-Lenkiewicz OM(3).

Activation of the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) stimulates the production of 
pro-inflammatory molecules involved in the formation of intracranial aneurysms 
(IA). The study aimed to assess the NF-κB p65 subunit and the GRO-α chemokine 
and its receptor CXCR2 concentrations in unruptured intracranial aneurysm 
patients (UIA, n = 25) compared to individuals without vascular changes in the 
brain (n = 10). It was also analyzed whether tested proteins are related to the 
size and number of aneurysms. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum protein levels 
were measured using the ELISA method. Median CSF and serum NF-κB p65 
concentrations were significantly lower, while median CSF GRO-α and CXCR2 
concentrations were significantly higher in UIA patients compared to the control 
group. CSF and serum NF-κB p65 concentrations negatively correlated with the 
number of aneurysms. In UIA patients the median GRO-α concentration was two-fold 
and CXCR2 almost four-fold higher in CSF compared to the serum value. CSF GRO-α 
concentration positively correlated with the size of aneurysms.Significantly 
decreased CSF NF-κB p65 and significantly increased CSF GRO-α and its CXCR2 
receptor concentrations in UIA patients compared to the control group may 
altogether suggest that the canonical NF-κB signaling pathway is activated and 
its target pro-inflammatory genes are highly expressed in UIA patients. However, 
to unequivocally assess the involvement of the classical NF-κB pathway with the 
participation of the NF-κB p65 subunit and the GRO-α/CXCR2 axis in the formation 
of IA, further in vivo model studies are needed.

Development of New Antibodies and an ELISA System to Detect the Potato Alkaloids 
α-Solanine and α-Chaconine.

Okada K(1), Matsuo K(2).

Food poisoning can be caused by the potato alkaloids α-solanine (SO) and 
α-chaconine (CHA). Therefore, this study aimed to establish new enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for detecting these two toxins in biological 
samples and potato extracts. Two antibodies that bind to solanidine, a chemical 
compound found in both SO and CHA, were newly developed, and two types of ELISAs 
(Sold1 ELISA and Sold2 ELISA) were constructed. We measured SO and CHA diluted 
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), serum, and urine. The detection performance 
of the two ELISAs for SO and CHA in PBS was higher than in serum and urine, and 
the sensitivity of Sold2 ELISA was lower than that of Sold1 ELISA. Thus, we used 
these ELISAs to measure SO and CHA in potato part extracts and found that potato 
sprouts contained approximately 80-fold more SO and CHA than tubers and 8-fold 
more SO and CHA than peels. Although the detection sensitivity of SO and CHA 
depends on the sample types, these ELISAs may be effective as future clinical 
and food testing methods after further improvements.

Effect of Polydeoxyribonucleotide (PDRN) Treatment on Corneal Wound Healing in 
Zebrafish (Danio rerio).

Edirisinghe SL(1), Nikapitiya C(1), Dananjaya SHS(2), Park J(2), Kim D(2), Choi 
D(2), De Zoysa M(1).

This study aimed to develop a corneal epithelial injury model in zebrafish 
(Danio rerio) and investigate the effectiveness of polydeoxyribonucleotide 
(PDRN) treatment on in vivo corneal epithelial regeneration and wound healing. 
Chemical injury to zebrafish cornea was produced by placing a small cotton swab 
containing 3% acetic acid solution. PDRN treatment was performed by immersing 
corneal-injured zebrafish in water containing PDRN (2 mg/mL) for 10 min at 0, 
24, 48, and 72 h post-injury (hpi). The level of corneal healing was evaluated 
by fluorescein staining, histological examination, transcriptional profiling, 
and immunoblotting techniques. Fluorescein staining results demonstrate that 
PDRN treatment significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the wounded area of the 
zebrafish eye at 48 and 72 hpi, suggesting that PDRN may accelerate the corneal 
re-epithelialization. Histopathological evaluation revealed that injured corneal 
epithelial cells were re-organized at 72 hpi upon PDRN treatment with increased 
goblet cell density and size. Moreover, transcriptional analysis results 
demonstrate that PDRN treatment induced the mRNA expression of adora2ab 
(6.3-fold), pax6a (7.8-fold), pax6b (29.3-fold), klf4 (7.3-fold), and muc2.1 
(5.0-fold) after the first treatment. Besides, tnf-α (2.0-fold) and heat-shock 
proteins (hsp70; 2.8-fold and hsp90ab1; 1.6-fold) have modulated the gene 
expression following the PDRN treatment. Immunoblotting results convincingly 
confirmed the modulation of Mmp-9, Hsp70, and Tnf-α expression levels upon PDRN 
treatment. Overall, our corneal injury model in zebrafish allows for 
understanding the morphological and molecular events of corneal epithelial 
healing, and ophthalmic responses for PDRN treatment following acid injury in 
zebrafish.

Developing ecotourism sustainability maximization (ESM) model: a safe minimum 
standard for climate change mitigation in the Indian Himalayas.

Ashok S(1), Behera MD(2), Tewari HR(3), Jana C(4).

Recently, ecotourism has been identified as an adaptation strategy for 
mitigating climate change impacts, as it can optimize carbon sequestration, 
biodiversity recovery, and livelihood benefits and generate new opportunities 
for the sustenance of the economy, environment, and society of the area endowed 
with natural resources and cultural values. With the growing responsibility at 
the global level, ecotourism resource management (ERM) becomes inevitable for 
its sustainable requirements. The integration of ecological and socio-economic 
factors is vital for ERM, as has been demonstrated by developing an Ecotourism 
Sustainability Maximization Model for an area under study, that is the 
Yuksam-Dzongri corridor (also known as Kangchendzonga Base Camp Trek), in the 
Khangchendzonga Biosphere Reserve (KBR), Sikkim, India. This model is based on 
the earlier developed ecotourism sustainability assessment (ESA) framework by 
the authors, which is based on the hierarchical relationship among ecotourism 
principles, criteria, indicators, and verifiers. Employing such relationships, 
this paper attempts to maximize ecotourism sustainability (ES) as a function of 
its sustainability principles, criteria, indicators, and verifiers, subject to 
the constraints identified through the safe minimum standard (SMS) approach by 
employing linear programming. Using 58 indicators as decision variables and 114 
constraints, the model resulted in a maximum level of achievable ES with a score 
of 84.6%, allowing the resultant optimum values of the indicators to be 
maintained at the operational level. A central tenet of the model is the 
collective responsibility and adoption of a holistic approach involving the 
government, tourists, tourism enterprises, and local people.

The role of systemic dehydration in vocal fold healing: Preliminary findings.

Venkatraman A(1), Hawkins J(2), McCain R(3), Duan C(4), Cannes do Nascimento 
N(1), Cox A(5), Sivasankar MP(1).

RATIONALE: Systemic dehydration negatively alters the expression of vocal fold 
inflammatory and cell junction markers. These biological changes can have 
downstream effects on the healing processes of injured vocal folds. In the 
dermis, reduced hydration prolongs inflammation and delays healing. It is 
unknown whether this biological effect is observed in vocal fold tissue.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of systemic dehydration on vocal fold 
healing outcomes following acute, bilateral vocal fold injury in a rodent model.
METHODS: Eighteen systemic dehydrated and 18 euhydrated adult male Sprague 
Dawley rats experienced bilateral vocal fold injuries or no injury 
(N = 9/group). Vocal fold gene expression levels of inflammatory mediators and 
epithelial cell junction markers were measured 24 h post-injury.
RESULTS: Pro-inflammatory gene markers (IL-1β; TNF-α) were differentially 
expressed in response to systemic dehydration with vocal fold injury compared to 
non-injury. Epithelial cell junction markers (Cadherin-3, Desmoglein-1) also 
exhibited divergent trends following systemic dehydration, but these data were 
not statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Systemic dehydration may affect cellular vocal fold healing 
processes within 24 h. These findings lay the groundwork for further 
investigation of how hydration status can affect vocal fold tissue recovery and 
influence clinical care.

DMFpred: Predicting protein disorder molecular functions based on protein cubic 
language model.

Pang Y(1), Liu B(1)(2).

Intrinsically disordered proteins and regions (IDP/IDRs) are widespread in 
living organisms and perform various essential molecular functions. These 
functions are summarized as six general categories, including entropic chain, 
assembler, scavenger, effector, display site, and chaperone. The alteration of 
IDP functions is responsible for many human diseases. Therefore, identifying the 
function of disordered proteins is helpful for the studies of drug target 
discovery and rational drug design. Experimental identification of the molecular 
functions of IDP in the wet lab is an expensive and laborious procedure that is 
not applicable on a large scale. Some computational methods have been proposed 
and mainly focus on predicting the entropic chain function of IDRs, while the 
computational predictive methods for the remaining five important categories of 
disordered molecular functions are desired. Motivated by the growing numbers of 
experimental annotated functional sequences and the need to expand the coverage 
of disordered protein function predictors, we proposed DMFpred for disordered 
molecular functions prediction, covering disordered assembler, scavenger, 
effector, display site and chaperone. DMFpred employs the Protein Cubic Language 
Model (PCLM), which incorporates three protein language models for 
characterizing sequences, structural and functional features of proteins, and 
attention-based alignment for understanding the relationship among three 
captured features and generating a joint representation of proteins. The PCLM 
was pre-trained with large-scaled IDR sequences and fine-tuned with functional 
annotation sequences for molecular function prediction. The predictive 
performance evaluation on five categories of functional and multi-functional 
residues suggested that DMFpred provides high-quality predictions. The 
web-server of DMFpred can be freely accessed from http://bliulab.net/DMFpred/.

Transformer-based deep learning for predicting protein properties in the life 
sciences.

Chandra A(1), Tünnermann L(2), Löfstedt T(1), Gratz R(2)(3).

Recent developments in deep learning, coupled with an increasing number of 
sequenced proteins, have led to a breakthrough in life science applications, in 
particular in protein property prediction. There is hope that deep learning can 
close the gap between the number of sequenced proteins and proteins with known 
properties based on lab experiments. Language models from the field of natural 
language processing have gained popularity for protein property predictions and 
have led to a new computational revolution in biology, where old prediction 
results are being improved regularly. Such models can learn useful multipurpose 
representations of proteins from large open repositories of protein sequences 
and can be used, for instance, to predict protein properties. The field of 
natural language processing is growing quickly because of developments in a 
class of models based on a particular model-the Transformer model. We review 
recent developments and the use of large-scale Transformer models in 
applications for predicting protein characteristics and how such models can be 
used to predict, for example, post-translational modifications. We review 
shortcomings of other deep learning models and explain how the Transformer 
models have quickly proven to be a very promising way to unravel information 
hidden in the sequences of amino acids.

Myofibroblasts Are Not Characteristic Features of Keloid Lesions.

Hahn JM(1), McFarland KL(1), Combs KA(1), Powell HM(2)(3), Supp DM(1)(3).

Keloids are disfiguring, scar-like lesions that are challenging to treat, with 
low response rates to current interventions and frequent recurrence. It has been 
widely reported that keloids are characterized by myofibroblasts, specialized 
contractile fibroblasts that express alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). However, 
evidence supporting a role for myofibroblasts in keloid pathology is 
inconclusive, with conflicting reports in the literature. This complicates 
development of more effective therapies, as the benefit of interventions 
targeting myofibroblasts is unclear. This study was undertaken to determine 
whether myofibroblasts can be considered characteristic of keloids.
METHODS: Myofibroblasts in tissue sections from keloids, hypertrophic scars 
(HTSs), and normal skin were localized by α-SMA immunostaining. Expression of 
α-SMA mRNA (ACTA2 gene) in normal skin and keloid tissue, and in fibroblasts 
from normal skin, keloid, and HTSs, was measured using quantitative polymerase 
chain reaction.
RESULTS: Normal skin did not exhibit α-SMA-expressing myofibroblasts, but 
myofibroblasts were identified in 50% of keloids and 60% of HTSs. No significant 
differences in ACTA2 expression between keloid and normal skin tissue were 
observed. Mean ACTA2 expression was higher in HTS (2.54-fold, P = 0.005) and 
keloid fibroblasts (1.75-fold, P = 0.046) versus normal fibroblasts in vitro. 
However, α-SMA expression in keloids in vivo was not associated with elevated 
ACTA2 in keloid fibroblasts in vitro.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite elevated ACTA2 in cultured keloid fibroblasts, 
myofibroblast presence is not a consistent feature of keloids. Therefore, 
therapies that target myofibroblasts may not be effective for all keloids. 
Further research is required to define the mechanisms driving keloid formation 
for development of more effective therapies.

Conservation and Diversity in Allosteric Fingerprints of Proteins for 
Evolutionary-inspired Engineering and Design.

Tee WV(1), Tan ZW(1), Guarnera E(1), Berezovsky IN(2).

Hand-in-hand work of physics and evolution delivered protein universe with 
diversity of forms, sizes, and functions. Pervasiveness and advantageous traits 
of allostery made it an important component of the protein function regulation, 
calling for thorough investigation of its structural determinants and evolution. 
Learning directly from nature, we explored here allosteric communication in 
several major folds and repeat proteins, including α/β and β-barrels, 
β-propellers, Ig-like fold, ankyrin and α/β leucine-rich repeat proteins, which 
provide structural platforms for many different enzymatic and signalling 
functions. We obtained a picture of conserved allosteric communication 
characteristic in different fold types, modifications of the structure-driven 
signalling patterns via sequence-determined divergence to specific functions, as 
well as emergence and potential diversification of allosteric regulation in 
multi-domain proteins and oligomeric assemblies. Our observations will be 
instrumental in facilitating the engineering and de novo design of proteins with 
allosterically regulated functions, including development of therapeutic 
biologics. In particular, results described here may guide the identification of 
the optimal structural platforms (e.g. fold type, size, and oligomerization 
states) and the types of diversifications/perturbations, such as mutations, 
effector binding, and order-disorder transition. The tunable allosteric linkage 
across distant regions can be used as a pivotal component in the 
design/engineering of modular biological systems beyond the traditional 
scaffolding function.

Immunomodulatory effect of polysaccharides isolated from Lonicera japonica 
Thunb. in cyclophosphamide-treated BALB/c mice.

Zhang T(1)(2), Liu H(1), Ma P(1), Huang J(1)(2), Bai X(3), Liu P(3), Zhu L(3), 
Min X(1)(2).

Lonicera japonica (L. japonica) is utilized as foods and healthy drink around 
the world. Until now, the immunomodulatory activity of polysaccharides from 
L. japonica (LJP) is little studied. In our previous work, LJP was fractionated 
to a neutral component (LJP-N) and an acidic component (LJP-A) by a 
DEAE-Cellulose column, and LJP-N was a starch-like polysaccharide and LJP-A was 
a pectic polysaccharide. In this study, LJP-N and LJP-A were investigated for 
their immunomodulatory effect, and the protective effect of these two 
polysaccharide fractions against immune injury by cyclophosphamide (CTX) in 
BALB/c mice was evaluated. Results showed that when compared with CTX group, LJP 
fractions, especially for LJP-A (200 mg kg-1) can enhance the immune function, 
improve atrophy of the lymphoid organs thymus and spleen (the increased 
approximately 1.8- and 1.6-fold), increase the phagocytic function of 
macrophages (increased approximately 1.7-fold), increase the secretion of 
cytokines (the levels of IL-6, IL-2, and TNF-α increased approximately 2.5-, 
2.0-, and 1.4-fold) and immunoglobulins levels (the levels of IgM and IgG 
increased approximately 1.2- and 1.7-fold) in serum, and enhance the cytotoxic 
activity of NK cells (increased approximately 3.5-fold). Taken together, the 
present results suggest that LJP-A, rich in uronic acid, with a molecular weight 
of 400 kDa, may be a potential candidate as the functional foods.

Impact of the introduction of a low-cost uterine balloon tamponade (ESM-UBT) 
device for managing severe postpartum hemorrhage in India: A comparative 
before-and-after study.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of introducing a uterine balloon tamponade 
(ESM-UBT) device for managing severe postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), mainly due to 
uterine atony, in health facilities in India on the rates of PPH-related 
maternal death and invasive procedures for PPH control.
METHODS: We used a quasi-experimental, difference-in-difference (DID) design to 
compare changes in the rates of a composite outcome (PPH-related maternal death 
and/or artery ligation, uterine compression sutures, or hysterectomy) among 
women delivering in nine intervention facilities compared with those delivering 
in two control facilities, before and after the introduction of ESM-UBT.
RESULTS: The study sample included 214 123 deliveries (n = 78 509 before ESM-UBT 
introduction; n = 47 211 during ESM-UBT introduction; and n = 88 403 after 
ESM-UBT introduction). After introduction of ESM-UBT, there was a significant 
decline in the rate of the primary composite outcome in intervention facilities 
(21.0-11.4 per 10 000 deliveries; difference -9.6, 95% confidence interval -14.0 
to -5.4). Change in the rate of the primary composite outcome was not 
significant in control facilities (11.7-17.2 per 10 000 deliveries; difference 
5.4, 95% confidence interval -3.9 to 14.9). DID analyses showed there was a 
significant reduction in the rate of the primary composite outcome in 
intervention facilities relative to control facilities (adjusted DID estimate 
-15.0 per 10 000 points, 95% confidence interval -23.3 to -6.8; P = 0.005).
CONCLUSION: Introduction of the ESM-UBT in health facilities in India was 
associated with a significant reduction in PPH-related maternal death and/or 
invasive procedures for PPH control.

TREAT: Therapeutic RNAs exploration inspired by artificial intelligence 
technology.

Zhao L(1), Wu Y(1), Zhang D(4), Bu D(1)(5), Chen R(4)(6), Zhao Y(1).

Recent advances in RNA engineering have enabled the development of RNA-based 
therapeutics for a broad spectrum of applications. Developing RNA therapeutics 
start with targeted RNA screening and move to the drug design and optimization. 
However, existing target screening tools ignore noncoding RNAs and their 
disease-relevant regulatory relationships. And designing therapeutic RNAs 
encounters high computational complexity of multi-objective optimization to 
overcome the immunogenicity, instability and inefficient translational 
production. To unlock the therapeutic potential of noncoding RNAs and enable 
one-stop screening and design of therapeutic RNAs, we have built the platform 
TREAT. It incorporates 43,087,953 regulatory relationships between coding and 
noncoding genes from 81 biological networks under different physiological 
conditions. TREAT introduces graph representation learning with Random Walk 
Diffusions to perform disease-relevant target screening, in addition to the 
commonly utilized Topological Degree and PageRank algorithms. Design and 
optimization of large RNAs or interfering RNAs are both available. To reduce the 
computational complexity of multi-objective optimization for large RNA, we 
stratified the features into local and global features. The local features are 
evaluated on the fixed-length or dynamic-length local bins, whereas the latter 
are inspired by AI language models of protein sequence. Then the global 
assessment is performed on refined candidates, thus reducing the enormous search 
space. Overall, TREAT is a one-stop platform for the screening and designing of 
therapeutic RNAs, with particular attention to noncoding RNAs and cutting-edge 
AI technology embedded, leading the progress of innovative therapeutics for 
challenging diseases. TREAT is freely accessible at https://rna.org.cn/treat.

Rudolph M(1), Rominger F(1), Hashmi ASK(1)(2).

α-Ketoamides have been found to be an important functional group in a broad 
spectrum of inhibitors such as the Corona virus and other viruses. Here we 
report an unprecedented gold-catalyzed 2-fold reaction of a bromoalkyne with 
anthranils. Hydrolysis of the initial product then directly leads to 
α-ketoamides. Water addition to the intermediate α-iminoimidoyl halides 
delivered α-ketoamides from a broad range of bromoalkynes.

Survey of Protein Sequence Embedding Models.

Tran C(1), Khadkikar S(2), Porollo A(3)(4)(5).

Derived from the natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, protein language 
models enable the encoding of protein sequences, which are widely diverse in 
length and amino acid composition, in fixed-size numerical vectors (embeddings). 
We surveyed representative embedding models such as Esm, Esm1b, ProtT5, and 
SeqVec, along with their derivatives (GoPredSim and PLAST), to conduct the 
following tasks in computational biology: embedding the Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
proteome, gene ontology (GO) annotation of the uncharacterized proteins of this 
organism, relating variants of human proteins to disease status, correlating 
mutants of beta-lactamase TEM-1 from Escherichia coli with experimentally 
measured antimicrobial resistance, and analyzing diverse fungal mating factors. 
We discuss the advances and shortcomings, differences, and concordance of the 
models. Of note, all of the models revealed that the uncharacterized proteins in 
yeast tend to be less than 200 amino acids long, contain fewer aspartates and 
glutamates, and are enriched for cysteine. Less than half of these proteins can 
be annotated with GO terms with high confidence. The distribution of the cosine 
similarity scores of benign and pathogenic mutations to the reference human 
proteins shows a statistically significant difference. The differences in 
embeddings of the reference TEM-1 and mutants have low to no correlation with 
minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC).

Expression of Transient Receptor Potential Channel Genes and Their Isoforms in 
Alpha-Cells and Beta-Cells of Human Islets of Langerhans.

Matos GM(1), Andersson B(1), Islam MS(2)(3).

Expression of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel genes and their 
isoforms in the alpha-cells and the beta-cells of the human islets of Langerhans 
has not been studied in detail. In this study, we have analyzed the RNA 
sequencing data obtained from purified human alpha-cells and beta-cells to 
identify the genes and their isoforms that are expressed differentially in these 
two cell types. We found that TRPC1, TRPC4, TRPC7, TRPM3, and TRPML1 were 
differentially expressed in these two cell types. TRPC1, TRPM3, and TRPML1 were 
expressed at a higher level in the beta-cells than in the alpha-cells. TRPC4 and 
TRPC7 were expressed at a higher level in the alpha-cells than in the 
beta-cells. The TRPC4-206 isoform was expressed at a 45-fold higher level in the 
alpha-cells compared to the beta-cells. Expression of TRPM3-202 was 200-fold and 
TRPM3-209 was 25-fold higher in the beta-cells than in the alpha-cells. Our 
study has demonstrated the relative abundance of expression of the TRP channel 
genes and their isoforms in the human alpha-cells and the beta-cells.

Characterization of immunomodulatory responses induced by manuka honey.

Masad RJ(1), Nasser RA(1), Bashir G(1), Mohamed YA(1), Al-Sbiei A(2), Al-Saafeen 
BH(1), Fernandez-Cabezudo MJ(2), Al-Ramadi BK(1)(3).

Manuka honey (MH) is known for its wound-healing, anti-microbial, anti-oxidant 
and anti-tumor properties. However, there is conflicting evidence regarding the 
role of MH in inflammatory responses, with some studies highlighting its 
pro-inflammatory capacity and others showing that it has a predominantly 
anti-inflammatory activity. The current study is aimed at characterizing the 
immunomodulatory capacity of MH using both in vitro and in vivo approaches, 
focusing on the underlying mechanisms. Treatment of RAW 264.7 macrophages with 
1% MH (w/v) resulted in a significant increase in the gene expression (~26-fold) 
and secretion (~27-fold) of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Similarly, an 
increase was observed in the gene expression of other inflammatory cytokines 
including interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and inducible nitric 
oxide synthase (iNOS), as well as the chemokines; (C-X-C motif) ligand 2 (CXCL2) 
and (C-C) motif ligand 2 (CCL2). Using an in vivo model, intraperitoneal (i.p.) 
administration of MH in C57BL/6 mice elicited a peritoneal response 
characterized by a significant expansion in the number of peritoneal exudate 
cells (PECs), which was mainly due to a 35-fold increase in the recruitment of 
neutrophils. Importantly, this response was evident in toll-like receptor 4 
(TLR4)-defective C3H/HeJ mice, indicating that the observed stimulatory effect 
occurs independently of TLR4 and unlikely to be mediated by any 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) contaminant. MH administration also led to changes in 
the phenotypic expression and functional maturation of peritoneal macrophages, 
as evidenced by a shift towards the CD11blo F4/80lo phenotype and an increase in 
the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II proteins. In 
contrast, the MH-initiated peritoneal response was largely abrogated in mice 
deficient in myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) protein, a 
critical adaptor of most TLR signaling pathways. Thus, the current findings help 
to characterize the immunostimulatory properties of MH and their dependence on 
TLR signaling, and highlight the potential utility of MH as an immunomodulatory 
agent in a variety of disorders.

Fine-tuning of BERT Model to Accurately Predict Drug-Target Interactions.

Kang H(1), Goo S(1), Lee H(1), Chae JW(1)(2), Yun HY(1)(2), Jung S(1)(3).

The identification of optimal drug candidates is very important in drug 
discovery. Researchers in biology and computational sciences have sought to use 
machine learning (ML) to efficiently predict drug-target interactions (DTIs). In 
recent years, according to the emerging usefulness of pretrained models in 
natural language process (NLPs), pretrained models are being developed for 
chemical compounds and target proteins. This study sought to improve DTI 
predictive models using a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from the 
Transformers (BERT)-pretrained model, ChemBERTa, for chemical compounds. 
Pretraining features the use of a simplified molecular-input line-entry system 
(SMILES). We also employ the pretrained ProBERT for target proteins (pretraining 
employed the amino acid sequences). The BIOSNAP, DAVIS, and BindingDB databases 
(DBs) were used (alone or together) for learning. The final model, taught by 
both ChemBERTa and ProtBert and the integrated DBs, afforded the best DTI 
predictive performance to date based on the receiver operating characteristic 
area under the curve (AUC) and precision-recall-AUC values compared with 
previous models. The performance of the final model was verified using a 
specific case study on 13 pairs of subtrates and the metabolic enzyme cytochrome 
P450 (CYP). The final model afforded excellent DTI prediction. As the real-world 
interactions between drugs and target proteins are expected to exhibit specific 
patterns, pretraining with ChemBERTa and ProtBert could teach such patterns. 
Learning the patterns of such interactions would enhance DTI accuracy if 
learning employs large, well-balanced datasets that cover all relationships 
between drugs and target proteins.

Comparative study of TNF-α and vitamin D reveals a significant role of TNF-α in 
NSCLC in an ethnically conserved vitamin D deficient population.

Bhat IA(1), Mir IR(1), Malik GH(1), Mir JI(2), Dar TA(3), Nisar S(4), Naik 
NA(5), Sabah ZU(6), Shah ZA(7).

Growing evidence has implicated tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) as an 
important regulator of the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, various molecular 
epidemiological studies have proposed vitamin D deficiency to be a mediator of 
cancer progression. Here we comparatively analyzed the role of TNF-α and vitamin 
D in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in an ethnically conserved vitamin D 
deficient population. Confirmed NSCLC cases (n = 190) matchedfor age, gender, 
dwelling, and smoking against cancer-free healthy controls ((n = 200) were 
genotyped for TNF-α promoter polymorphisms (rs361525 and rs1800629) by PCR-RFLP. 
48 NSCLC tumor and adjacent normal tissues were quantified for TNF-α mRNA 
expression by RT-qPCR. 48 NSCLC cases and 60 healthy controls were analyzed for 
TNF-α and vitamin D serum levels by ELISA and chemiluminescence respectively. 
Our study indicates thatrs361525 and rs1800629 bear a significant risk towards 
NSCLC. Both mutant genotype and mutant allele of rs361525 elicit a likelihood of 
NSCLC reflected by their odds ratio (OR) of 3.16 and 1.81 respectively. In case 
of rs1800629, the heterogeneous genotype (GA) showed two fold higher risk for 
NSCLC (OR-2.07, P = 0.006), which could be attributed to the presence of the 
mutant allele as reflected by overall frequency of mutant A allele vs wild G 
allele (OR-1.92, P = 0.01). A combined effect of genotypes for rs361525 and 
rs1800629 revealed a 3.7 fold higher risk towards NSCLC for the presence of 
heterozygous genotype at both loci. Our preliminary expression results showed 
significant increase of TNF-α mRNA expression in tumor tissues of NSCLC as 
compared to adjacent normal tissues [cases- 8.56 ± 3.90vs controls-4.88 ± 2.96, 
P &lt; 0.0001)] which was further affirmed by extrapolation of TNF-α expression 
in serum (Cases- 55.75 ± 22.50vs controls- 21.46 ± 27.75, P &lt; 0.0001). 
Multivariate regression analyses revealed TNF-α mRNA expression to be 
significantly associated with NSCLC cases less than 50 years of age 
(P &lt; 0.05). In comparison to the putative role of TNF-α in NSCLC as suggested 
by the results observed, vitamin D showed no significance towards any of the 
analyzed parameters or with the risk of NSCLC. This study suggests that TNF-α 
could be a potential mediator of NSCLC which bears important clinical 
implications and could be an important therapeutic marker in NSCLC.

Engineering Saccharomyces cerevisiae for enhanced (-)-α-bisabolol production.

Jiang Y(1)(2), Xia L(1)(2), Gao S(1)(2), Li N(1)(2), Yu S(1)(2), Zhou 
J(1)(2)(3)(4).

(-)-α-Bisabolol is naturally occurring in many plants and has great potential in 
health products and pharmaceuticals. However, the current extraction method from 
natural plants is unsustainable and cannot fulfil the increasing requirement. 
This study aimed to develop a sustainable strategy to enhance the biosynthesis 
of (-)-α-bisabolol by metabolic engineering. By introducing the heterologous 
gene MrBBS and weakening the competitive pathway gene ERG9, a de novo 
(-)-α-bisabolol biosynthesis strain was constructed that could produce 
221.96 mg/L (-)-α-bisabolol. Two key genes for (-)-α-bisabolol biosynthesis, 
ERG20 and MrBBS, were fused by a flexible linker (GGGS)3 under the GAL7 promoter 
control, and the titer was increased by 2.9-fold. Optimization of the mevalonic 
acid pathway and multi-copy integration further increased (-)-α-bisabolol 
production. To promote product efflux, overexpression of PDR15 led to an 
increase in extracellular production. Combined with the optimal strategy, 
(-)-α-bisabolol production in a 5 L bioreactor reached 7.02 g/L, which is the 
highest titer reported in yeast to date. This work provides a reference for the 
efficient production of (-)-α-bisabolol in yeast.

Establishment and characterization of immortalized human vocal fold fibroblast 
cell lines.

Chu Y(#)(1), Fang Y(#)(1), Wu H(1), Cheng L(2), Chen J(3).

PURPOSE: Vocal fold scarring is abnormal scar tissue in the lamina propria layer 
of the vocal fold. To facilitate investigation of vocal fold scarring, we 
established and characterized immortalized human vocal fold fibroblast (iHVFF) 
cell lines.
METHODS: Human vocal fold fibroblasts were immortalized by introducing Simian 
virus 40 large T antigen (SV40TAg) by transfection. Successfully transfected 
fibroblasts were sorted using flow cytometry. Immunofluorescence cytochemistry 
and western blot were applied to analyze the expression of fibronectin, 
vimentin, alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and fibroblast activation protein 
(FAP). Cell proliferation rate was measured by CCK-8 assay. Real-time 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to analyze the mRNA 
expression level.
RESULTS: The iHVFFs continued to proliferate for more than 30 generations and 
appeared spindle-shaped. The expression of Vimentin and α-SMA were detected in 
both iHVFFs and primary fibroblasts, and enhanced expression of FAP was observed 
in iHVFFs. Furthermore, iHVFFs exhibited an increased proliferative capability 
compared with the primary fibroblasts. RT-qPCR results suggested that collagen 
type III alpha 1 chain (COL3A1), interleukin-6, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), 
hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in the iHVFFs 
significantly increased, whereas transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), elastin 
and matrix metallopeptidase-1 (MMP-1) expression significantly downregulated. No 
differences in mRNA expression of α-SMA, fibronectin and collagen type I alpha 2 
chain (COL1A2) were noted between iHVFFs and primary fibroblasts.
CONCLUSION: iHVFFs can be used as a novel tool cell for future researches on the 
mechanisms of pathogenesis and treatment of vocal fold scarring.

Combination of Maternal Serum ESM-1 and PLGF with Uterine Artery Doppler PI for 
Predicting Preeclampsia.

Xie X(1)(2), Chen D(1)(2)(3), Yang X(1)(2)(4), Cao Y(1), Guo Y(1), Cheng 
W(1)(2).

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether the combination of 
pregnancy-associated endothelial cell-specific molecule 1 (ESM-1), the placental 
growth factor (PLGF) in the first- and second-trimester maternal serum, and the 
uterine artery Doppler pulsatility index (PI) in the second trimester can 
predict preeclampsia (PE).
METHODS: The serum levels of ESM-1 and PLGF in 33 severe preeclampsia (SPE) 
patients, 18 mild preeclampsia patients (MPE), and 60 age-matched normal 
controls (CON) were measured. The Doppler ultrasonography was performed, and the 
artery pulsatility index (PI) was calculated for the same subjects.
RESULTS: The 2nd PLGF level was significantly lower and the 2nd PI was higher 
than those in the MPE group. Combining the 2nd PLGF with the 2nd PI yielded an 
AUC of 0.819 (83.33% sensitivity and 70.00% specificity). In the SPE group, the 
1st ESM-1 level and the 2nd PLGF level were significantly lower, and the 2nd 
ESM-1 level and the 2nd PI were significantly higher in the SPE group. The 
combination of the 1st ESM-1, the 2nd PLGF, and the 2nd PI yielded an AUC of 
0.912 (72.73% sensitivity and 95.00% specificity).
CONCLUSIONS: The 1st ESM-1 and the 2nd PLGF levels and the 2nd PI were 
associated with PE. The combination of serum biomarkers and the PI improved the 
screening efficiency of the PE prediction, especially for SPE.

Potent and Selective Cell-Active Iminosugar Inhibitors of Human 
α-N-Acetylgalactosaminidase (α-NAGAL).

Ashmus RA(1), Wang Y(1), González-Cuesta M(2), King DT(3), Tiet B(1), Chen X(1), 
Zhu Y(1), Kirk B(1), García Fernandez JÉM(4), Ortiz Mellet C(5), Britton R(1), 
Vocadlo DJ(6).

Glycoside hydrolases (GHs) are a class of enzymes with emerging roles in various 
diseases. Selective GH inhibitors are sought to better understand their 
functions and assess the therapeutic potential of modulating their activities. 
Iminosugars are a promising class of GH inhibitors but typically lack the 
selectivity required to accurately perturb biological systems. Here, we describe 
a concise synthesis of iminosugar inhibitors of N-acetyl-α-galactosaminidase 
(α-NAGAL), the GH responsible for cleaving terminal α-N-acetylgalactosamine 
residues from glycoproteins and glycoconjugates. Starting from non-carbohydrate 
precursors, this modular synthesis supported the identification of a potent (490 
nM) and α-NAGAL selective (~200-fold) guanidino-containing derivative DGJNGuan.  
To illustrate the cellular activity of this new inhibitor, we developed a 
quantitative fluorescence image-based method to measure levels of the 
Tn-antigen, a cellular glycoprotein substrate of a-NAGAL. Using this assay we 
show that DGJGuan exhibits excellent inhibition of a-NAGAL within cells using 
patient derived fibroblasts (EC50 = 150 nM). Moreover, in vitro and in cell 
assays to assess levels of lysosomal b-hexosaminidase substrate ganglioside GM2 
show that DGJGuan is selective whereas DGJNAc exhibits off-target inhibition 
both in vitro and within cells. DGJNGuan is a readily produced and selective 
tool compound that should prove useful for investigating the physiological roles 
of α-NAGAL.

A systematic review of the relationship between momentary emotional states and 
nonsuicidal self-injurious thoughts and behaviours.

Brown AC(1), Dhingra K(2), Brown TD(3), Danquah AN(1), Taylor PJ(1).

BACKGROUND: Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is associated with high levels of 
distress, co-morbid mental health issues, and elevated risk of suicide. Previous 
literature indicates that emotion regulation is the most endorsed function of 
NSSI. Experience Sampling Methodology (ESM) provides a powerful tool for 
investigating the moment-to-moment associations between emotional states and 
NSSI thoughts and behaviours. The aim of the current study was to systematically 
review and evaluate ESM research concerning the relationship between momentary 
emotional states and NSSI.
METHODS: A systematic search of electronic databases from date of inception to 
16th April 2021 was conducted. This was supplemented through backwards citation 
tracking. A risk of bias assessment was completed prior to data synthesis.
RESULTS: Nineteen eligible studies were identified for inclusion in the review. 
Heightened negative affect was found to typically precede instances of NSSIT 
thoughts and behaviour. Results were less consistent for positive affect.
LIMITATIONS: Sample sizes across studies were often small, meaningful effect 
sizes were not always reported, and non-validated measures of NSSI thoughts and 
behaviour were used during ESM assessments.
CONCLUSIONS: The results support affect regulation models of NSSI, and 
demonstrate the value of ESM studies, specifically those sampling more than once 
per day, in plotting the temporal, "in-the-moment" characteristics of these 
processes.

Design decisions and data completeness for experience sampling methods used in 
psychosis: systematic review.

Deakin E(1)(2)(3), Ng F(4), Young E(5), Thorpe N(5), Newby C(6), Coupland C(6), 
Craven M(7)(8)(9), Slade M(4)(7)(10).

BACKGROUND: The experience sampling method (ESM) is an intensive longitudinal 
research method.  Participants complete questionnaires at multiple times about 
their current or very recent state. The design of ESM studies is complex. People 
with psychosis have been shown to be less adherent to ESM study protocols than 
the general population. It is not known how to design studies that increase 
adherence to study protocols. A lack of typology makes it is hard for 
researchers to decide how to collect data in a way that allows for 
methodological rigour, quality of reporting, and the ability to synthesise 
findings. The aims of this systematic review were to characterise the design 
choices made in ESM studies monitoring the daily lives of people with psychosis, 
and to synthesise evidence relating the data completeness to different design 
choices.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted of published literature on studies 
using ESM with people with psychosis. Studies were included if they used digital 
technology for data collection and reported the completeness of the data set. 
The constant comparative method was used to identify design decisions, using 
inductive identification of design decisions with simultaneous comparison of 
design decisions observed. Weighted regression was used to identify design 
decisions that predicted data completeness. The review was pre-registered 
(PROSPERO CRD42019125545).
RESULTS: Thirty-eight studies were included. A typology of design choices used 
in ESM studies was developed, which comprised three superordinate categories of 
design choice: Study context, ESM approach and ESM implementation. Design 
decisions that predict data completeness include type of ESM protocol used, 
length of time participants are enrolled in the study, and if there is contact 
with the research team during data collection.
CONCLUSIONS: This review identified a range of design decisions used in studies 
using ESM in the context of psychosis. Design decisions that influence data 
completeness were identified. Findings will help the design and reporting of 
future ESM studies. Results are presented with the focus on psychosis, but the 
findings can be applied across different mental health populations.

and is also a key intermediate metabolite in the flavonoid synthesis pathway. In 
this study, three α-rhamnosidases from Thermotoga petrophia DSM 13995 (TpeRha), 
Alternaria sp. L1 (AsRha), and Aspergillus mulundensis (AmRha), and three 
β-glucosidases from T. thermarum DSM 5069 T (BGLI-Tt and BGLII-Tt), and A. niger 
NL-1 (BGL-NL) were cloned, expressed, and characterized. The Kcat/Km value of 
AmRha for naringin was 2.389 s-1mM-1 which was 796-fold and 26-fold of TpeRha 
and AsRha. The Kcat/Km value of BGL-NL for prunin was 0.946 s-1mM-1, which was 
about 4.4-fold and 4.6-fold of BGLI-Tt and BGLII-Tt. According to the catalytic 
efficiency, expression level, and reaction condition compatibility, AmRha was 
coupled with BGL-NL to construct a one-pot enzymatic cascade for preparing 
naringenin from naringin. The effects of the ratio and dosage of the enzyme, the 
naringin concentration, and reaction conditions on naringenin production were 
optimized. At a dosage of 200 U/L AmRha and 1000 U/L BGL-NL, a temperature of 
50 °C and pH 5.0, 30 mM naringin was transformed into 29.3 mM naringenin for 
24 h reaction with a corresponding molar conversion of 97.6%. Therefore, this 
study provides an efficient enzymatic cascade to meet the large-scale and low 
cost preparation of naringenin from naringin.

outcomes in COVID-19 patients.

BACKGROUND: Chronic disease causes skeletal muscle loss that contributes to 
morbidity and mortality. There are limited data on the impact of dynamic muscle 
loss on clinical outcomes in COVID-19. We hypothesized that acute 
COVID-19-related muscle loss (acute sarcopenia) is associated with adverse 
outcomes.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a prospective clinical registry of COVID-19 
patients was performed in consecutive hospitalized patients with acute COVID-19 
(n = 95) and compared with non-COVID-19 controls (n = 19) with two temporally 
unique CT scans. Pectoralis muscle (PM), erector spinae muscle (ESM) and 30 day 
standardized per cent change in cross sectional muscle area were quantified. 
Primary outcomes included mortality and need for intensive care unit (ICU) 
admission. Multivariate linear and logistic regression were performed. Cox 
proportional hazard ratios were generated for ICU admission or mortality for the 
per cent muscle loss standardized to 30 days.
RESULTS: The COVID-19 CT scan cohort (n = 95) had an average age of 
63.3 ± 14.3 years, comorbidities including COPD (28.4%) and diabetes mellitus 
(42.1%), and was predominantly Caucasian (64.9%). The proportion of those 
admitted to the ICU was 54.7%, with 10.5% requiring tracheostomy and overall 
mortality 16.8%. Median duration between CT scans was 32 days (IQR: 16-63 days). 
Significant reductions in median per cent loss was noted for PM (-2.64% loss 
[IQR: -0.28, -5.47] in COVID-19 vs. -0.06 loss [IQR: -0.01, -0.28] in 
non-COVID-19 CT controls, P < 0.001) and ESM (-1.86% loss [IQR: -0.28, -5.47] in 
COVID-19 vs. -0.06 loss [IQR: -0.02, -0.11]) in non-COVID-19 CT controls, 
P < 0.001). Multivariate linear regression analysis of per cent loss in PM was 
significantly associated with mortality (-10.8% loss [95% CI: -21.5 to -0.19]) 
and ICU admission (-11.1% loss [95% CI: -19.4 to -2.67]), and not significant 
for ESM. Cox proportional hazard ratios demonstrated greater association with 
ICU admission (adj HR 2.01 [95% CI: 1.14-3.55]) and mortality (adj HR 5.30 [95% 
CI: 1.19-23.6]) for those with significant per cent loss in PM, and greater 
association with ICU admission (adj HR 8.22 [95% CI: 1.11-61.04]) but not 
mortality (adj HR 2.20 [95% CI: 0.70-6.97]) for those with significant per cent 
loss in ESM.
CONCLUSIONS: In a well-characterized cohort of 95 hospitalized patients with 
acute COVID-19 and two temporally distinct CT scans, acute sarcopenia, 
determined by standardized reductions in PM and ESM, was associated with worse 
clinical outcomes. These data lay the foundation for evaluating dynamic muscle 
loss as a predictor of clinical outcomes and targeting acute sarcopenia to 
improve clinical outcomes for COVID-19.

Experimental warming increases fungal alpha diversity in an oligotrophic 
maritime Antarctic soil.

Newsham KK(1), Misiak M(1)(2), Goodall-Copestake WP(1)(3), Dahl MS(4), Boddy 
L(2), Hopkins DW(5), Davey ML(4)(6).

The climate of maritime Antarctica has altered since the 1950s. However, the 
effects of increased temperature, precipitation and organic carbon and nitrogen 
availability on the fungal communities inhabiting the barren and oligotrophic 
fellfield soils that are widespread across the region are poorly understood. 
Here, we test how warming with open top chambers (OTCs), irrigation and the 
organic substrates glucose, glycine and tryptone soy broth (TSB) influence a 
fungal community inhabiting an oligotrophic maritime Antarctic fellfield soil. 
In contrast with studies in vegetated soils at lower latitudes, OTCs increased 
fungal community alpha diversity (Simpson's index and evenness) by 102-142% in 
unamended soil after 5 years. Conversely, OTCs had few effects on diversity in 
substrate-amended soils, with their only main effects, in glycine-amended soils, 
being attributable to an abundance of Pseudogymnoascus. The substrates reduced 
alpha and beta diversity metrics by 18-63%, altered community composition and 
elevated soil fungal DNA concentrations by 1-2 orders of magnitude after 5 
years. In glycine-amended soil, OTCs decreased DNA concentrations by 57% and 
increased the relative abundance of the yeast Vishniacozyma by 45-fold. The 
relative abundance of the yeast Gelidatrema declined by 78% in chambered soil 
and increased by 1.9-fold in irrigated soil. Fungal DNA concentrations were also 
halved by irrigation in TSB-amended soils. In support of regional- and 
continental-scale studies across climatic gradients, the observations indicate 
that soil fungal alpha diversity in maritime Antarctica will increase as the 
region warms, but suggest that the accumulation of organic carbon and nitrogen 
compounds in fellfield soils arising from expanding plant populations are 
likely, in time, to attenuate the positive effects of warming on diversity.

S(6), Al-Raddadi RM(7), Almashjary MN(8)(9)(10), Bawazir WMS(9)(11), Haque 
S(12).

Several therapies and cosmetics are available commercially to prevent or delay 
cell ageing, which manifests as premature cell death and skin dullness. Use of 
herbal products such as Aloe vera, curcumin, vitamin C-enriched natural 
antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory biomolecules are potential ways to prevent or 
delay ageing. Eggshell membrane (ESM) is also a rich source of collagen; 
glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) also play an essential role in healing and preventing 
ageing. It is important to use an extended therapeutic process to prolong the 
effectiveness of these products, despite the fact that they all have significant 
anti-ageing properties and the ability to regenerate healthy cells. Encapsulated 
herbal components are therefore designed to overcome the challenge of ensuring 
continued treatment over time to prolong the effects of a bioactive component 
after in situ administration. To study their synergistic effects on a cellular 
level, alginate, Aloe vera, and orange peel extract were encapsulated in 
bio-polymeric foaming beads and modified with eggshell membrane protein (ESMP) 
at various concentrations (1 gm, 2 gm, and 5 gm): (A-Av-OP, A-Av-OP-ESMP1, 
ESMP2, and ESMP3). Analysis of the structural and functional properties of 
foaming beads showed interconnected 3D porous structure, a 
surface-functionalized group for entrapment of ESMP, and a significant reduction 
in pore size (51-35 m) and porosity (80%-60%). By performing DPPH assays, HRBC 
stabilization assays, and antibacterial tests, the beads were assessed as a 
natural anti-ageing product with sustained release of molecules effective 
against inflammatory response, oxidative stress, and microbial contamination. 
MTT assays were conducted using in vitro cell cultures to demonstrate 
cytocompatibility (in mouse 3T3 fibroblast cells) and cytotoxicity (in human 
carcinoma HeLa cells). Our study demonstrates that bio-polymeric ESMP beads up 
to 2 g (A-Av-OP-ESMP2) are practical and feasible natural remedies for 
suspending defective cell pathways, preventing cell ageing, and promoting 
healthy cell growth, resulting in a viable and practical natural remedy or 
therapeutic system.

Skeletal muscle atrophy and short-term mortality in patients with acute 
exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: an observational cohort study.

Ichikado K(7), Tobino K(8), Tachikawa R(9), Ito H(10), Nakamura T(11), Kishaba 
T(12), Yamamoto Y(13), Inomata M(1), Izumo T(1).

BACKGROUND: Skeletal muscle atrophy, a common complication of idiopathic 
pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and its presence upon diagnosis can indicate a poor 
prognosis. Patients with IPF frequently experience acute exacerbations (AE), 
which is associated with a high mortality rate. However, the association between 
skeletal muscle atrophy and short-term mortality remains unknown.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective, multicenter cohort study of patients 
admitted for AE-IPF in Japan. The cross-sectional areas of the erector spinae 
muscle (ESMCSA) and the pectoralis muscle (PMCSA) were analyzed via single-slice 
computed tomography (CT). The primary outcome was 90-day mortality. Survival 
probability was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the log-rank test 
was used between the low and high groups of ESMCSA and PMCSA. We used 
multivariable Cox proportional-hazards models to evaluate the association 
between ESMCSA and PMCSA and prognosis.
RESULTS: Of the 212 patients included, 94 (44%) died during the observation 
period. The low ESMCSA group (<25.6 cm2) had a significantly worse prognosis 
than that of the high ESMCSA group (≥25.6 cm2) (hazard ratio (HR) [95% 
confidence interval (CI)]: 1.52 [1.00-2.33], P = 0.049). Multivariable analyses 
showed that all-cause mortality was associated with low ESMCSA (model 1, 
adjusted HR [95% CI]: 1.59 [0.98-2.60]; model 2, 1.55 [0.95-2.56], and model 3, 
1.67 [1.00-2.78], respectively). The adjusted HR of low PMCSA (<20.4 cm2) vs. 
high PMCSA (≥20.4 cm2) was 1.39 (95% CI: 0.88-2.20).
CONCLUSIONS: Low ESMCSA on CT images is associated with a high 90-day mortality 
rate in patients with AE-IPF.

Synergistic Effects of Plant Growth Regulators and Elicitors on α-Humulene and 
Zerumbone Production in Zingiber zerumbet Smith Adventitious Root Cultures.

Alwakil NH(1), Mohamad Annuar MS(1)(2), Jalil M(2)(3).

Zingiber zerumbet, also known as 'Lempoyang', possesses various phytomedicinal 
properties, such as anticancer, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antiulcer, and 
antioxidant properties. Secondary metabolites possessing such properties i.e., 
zerumbone and α-humulene, are found dominantly in the plant rhizome. Synergistic 
effects of plant growth hormones and elicitors on in vitro α-humulene and 
zerumbone production, and biomass growth, in adventitious root culture (AdRC) of 
Z. zerumbet cultivated in a two-stage culture are reported. The culture was 
induced by supplementation of 1.0 mg/L NAA and 2.0 mg/L IBA (dark), and 
subsequently maintained in medium supplemented with 1 mg/L NAA and 3 mg/L BAP 
(16:08 light-dark cycle), yielded the production of zerumbone at 3440 ± 168 µg/g 
and α-humulene at 3759 ± 798 µg/g. Synergistic elicitation by 400 μM methyl 
jasmonate (MeJa) and 400 μM salicylic acid (SA) resulted in a 13-fold increase 
in zerumbone (43,000 ± 200 µg/g), while 400 μM MeJa and 600 μM SA produced a 
4.3-fold increase in α-humulene (15,800 ± 5100 µg/g) compared to control.

BACKGROUND: The current COVID-19 pandemic and the previous SARS/MERS outbreaks 
of 2003 and 2012 have resulted in a series of major global public health crises. 
We argue that in the interest of developing effective and safe vaccines and 
drugs and to better understand coronaviruses and associated disease mechenisms 
it is necessary to integrate the large and exponentially growing body of 
heterogeneous coronavirus data. Ontologies play an important role in 
standard-based knowledge and data representation, integration, sharing, and 
analysis. Accordingly, we initiated the development of the community-based 
Coronavirus Infectious Disease Ontology (CIDO) in early 2020.
RESULTS: As an Open Biomedical Ontology (OBO) library ontology, CIDO is open 
source and interoperable with other existing OBO ontologies. CIDO is aligned 
with the Basic Formal Ontology and Viral Infectious Disease Ontology. CIDO has 
imported terms from over 30 OBO ontologies. For example, CIDO imports all 
SARS-CoV-2 protein terms from the Protein Ontology, COVID-19-related phenotype 
terms from the Human Phenotype Ontology, and over 100 COVID-19 terms for 
vaccines (both authorized and in clinical trial) from the Vaccine Ontology. CIDO 
systematically represents variants of SARS-CoV-2 viruses and over 300 amino acid 
substitutions therein, along with over 300 diagnostic kits and methods. CIDO 
also describes hundreds of host-coronavirus protein-protein interactions (PPIs) 
and the drugs that target proteins in these PPIs. CIDO has been used to model 
COVID-19 related phenomena in areas such as epidemiology. The scope of CIDO was 
evaluated by visual analysis supported by a summarization network method. CIDO 
has been used in various applications such as term standardization, inference, 
natural language processing (NLP) and clinical data integration. We have applied 
the amino acid variant knowledge present in CIDO to analyze differences between 
SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron variants. CIDO's integrative host-coronavirus PPIs 
and drug-target knowledge has also been used to support drug repurposing for 
COVID-19 treatment.
CONCLUSION: CIDO represents entities and relations in the domain of coronavirus 
diseases with a special focus on COVID-19. It supports shared knowledge 
representation, data and metadata standardization and integration, and has been 
used in a range of applications.

New SNCA mutation and structures of α-synuclein filaments from juvenile-onset 
synucleinopathy.

A 21-nucleotide duplication in one allele of SNCA was identified in a previously 
described disease with abundant α-synuclein inclusions that we now call 
juvenile-onset synucleinopathy (JOS). This mutation translates into the 
insertion of MAAAEKT after residue 22 of α-synuclein, resulting in a protein of 
147 amino acids. Both wild-type and mutant proteins were present in 
sarkosyl-insoluble material that was extracted from frontal cortex of the 
individual with JOS and examined by electron cryo-microscopy. The structures of 
JOS filaments, comprising either a single protofilament, or a pair of 
protofilaments, revealed a new α-synuclein fold that differs from the folds of 
Lewy body diseases and multiple system atrophy (MSA). The JOS fold consists of a 
compact core, the sequence of which (residues 36-100 of wild-type α-synuclein) 
is unaffected by the mutation, and two disconnected density islands (A and B) of 
mixed sequences. There is a non-proteinaceous cofactor bound between the core 
and island A. The JOS fold resembles the common substructure of MSA Type I and 
Type II dimeric filaments, with its core segment approximating the C-terminal 
body of MSA protofilaments B and its islands mimicking the N-terminal arm of MSA 
protofilaments A. The partial similarity of JOS and MSA folds extends to the 
locations of their cofactor-binding sites. In vitro assembly of recombinant 
wild-type α-synuclein, its insertion mutant and their mixture yielded structures 
that were distinct from those of JOS filaments. Our findings provide insight 
into a possible mechanism of JOS fibrillation in which mutant α-synuclein of 147 
amino acids forms a nucleus with the JOS fold, around which wild-type and mutant 
proteins assemble during elongation.

D-π-A-Based Trisubstituted Alkenes as Environmentally Sensitive Fluorescent 
Probes to Detect Lewy Pathologies.

Zeng Q(1), Chen Y(1), Yan Y(1), Wan R(1), Li Y(1), Fu H(1), Liu Y(2), Liu S(3), 
Yan XX(4), Cui M(1)(5).

Lewy pathologies, which mainly consist of insoluble α-synuclein (α-syn) 
aggregates, are the hallmarks of Parkinson's disease and many other 
neurodegenerative diseases termed "synucleinopathies". Detection of Lewy 
pathologies with optical methods is of interest for preclinical studies, while 
the α-syn fluorescent probe is still in great demand. By rational design, we 
obtained a series of D-π-A-based trisubstituted alkenes with acceptable optical 
properties and high binding affinities to α-syn fibrils. Among these probes, 
FPQXN and TQXN-2 exhibited high binding affinities (6 and 8 nM, respectively), 
significant fluorescence enhancements (17.2- and 26.6-fold, respectively), and 
satisfying quantum yields (36.5% and 10.4%, respectively), which met the need 
for the in vitro neuropathological staining of Lewy pathologies in the PD brain 
sections. In addition, TQXN-2 showed great potential in fluorescent 
discrimination of Lewy pathologies and Aβ plaques. Our research provides 
flexible tools for in vitro detection of α-syn aggregates and offers new 
structural frameworks for the further development of α-syn fluorescent probes.

Comment in
    Eur J Cardiothorac Surg. 2022 Dec 2;63(1):

OBJECTIVES: Erector spinae muscle (ESM) is an antigravity muscle group that can 
be evaluated as an index of muscle loss on chest computed tomography. The amount 
of ESM has been reported to be related to the prognosis of several respiratory 
diseases. However, few studies clarify the impact on postoperative 
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We investigated the relationship between ESM 
and postoperative prognosis in patients with early-stage NSCLC.
METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 534 patients with stage I NSCLC who 
underwent lobectomy or segmentectomy. The ESM was identified by preoperative 
computed tomography, and the amount was normalized according to height and sex. 
Overall survival, lung cancer-related deaths and non-lung cancer-related deaths 
(NLCRD) were analysed using log-rank and Gray's tests. Multivariable analyses 
were conducted to identify factors that influenced overall survival (OS) and 
NLCRD.
RESULTS: The amount of ESM normalized according to height and sex was 
significantly associated with age and body mass index. When the amount was low, 
OS (5-year OS, 79.6 vs 89.5%; P< 0.001) and NLCRD (5-year cumulative mortality 
rate, 14.7 vs 6.8%; P< 0.001) were significantly worse, although no difference 
was found in lung cancer-related deaths.
CONCLUSIONS: The amount of preoperative ESM was strongly related to non-lung 
cancer-related death and was a significant prognostic factor for stage I NSCLC. 
Patients with a low amount of the muscle should be treated based on proper risk 
assessment.

Promoting Daily Well-being in Adolescents using mHealth.

Mens MMJ(1)(2), Keijsers L(3), Dietvorst E(4), Koval S(4), Legerstee JS(4), 
Hillegers MHJ(4).

Adolescents are at increased risk for developing mental health problems. The 
Grow It! app is an mHealth intervention aimed at preventing mental health 
problems through improving coping by cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-inspired 
challenges as well as self-monitoring of emotions through Experience Sampling 
Methods (ESM). Yet, little is known about daily changes in well-being and coping 
during a stressful period, like the COVID-19 pandemic. The current study aimed 
to elucidate daily changes in positive and negative affect, and adaptive coping, 
and to better understand the within-person's mechanisms of the Grow It! app. The 
sample consisted of 12-25-year old Dutch adolescents in two independent cohorts 
(cohort 1: N = 476, Mage = 16.24, 76.1% female, 88.7% Dutch; cohort 2: N = 814, 
Mage = 18.45, 82.8% female, 97.2% Dutch). ESM were used to measure daily 
positive and negative affect and coping (cohort 1: 42 days, 210 assessments per 
person; cohort 2: 21 days, 105 assessments). The results showed that, on 
average, adolescents decreased in daily positive affect and adaptive coping, and 
increased in their experienced negative affect. A positive relation between 
adaptive coping and positive affect was found, although independent of the 
CBT-based challenges. Latent class analysis identified two heterogeneous 
trajectories for both positive and negative affect, indicating that the majority 
of participants with low to moderate-risk on developing mental health problems 
were likely to benefit from the Grow It! app.

Physical and mental fatigue in post-COVID syndrome and their associations over 
time: A small-sample ESM-study to explore fatigue, quality of sleep and 
behaviours.

Wensink M(1), Schaap G(1), Ten Klooster PM(1), Doggen CJM(2), van der Palen 
J(3), Vonkeman HE(4), Bode C(5).

OBJECTIVE: Post-COVID syndrome leaves millions of people with severe fatigue, 
yet little is known about its nature in daily life. In this exploratory study, 
momentary associations between physical and mental fatigue, quality of sleep and 
behaviours over two weeks in patients with post-COVID syndrome were assessed.
METHOD: Data on fatigue levels, quality of sleep and behaviours was collected 
for 14 consecutive days using the experience sampling method in ten 
ex-hospitalised patients with post-COVID syndrome.
RESULTS: Multilevel linear regression modelling showed strong associations 
between physical and mental fatigue (β = 0.61, p ≤0.001), significant both 
between and within individuals. Sleeping more hours at night was associated with 
less physical and mental fatigue the following day (β = -0.35, p = .001; 
β = -0.27, p = .008). Strenuous relaxation (B = 0.45, p ≤0.001; B = 0.28, 
p = .004) and social contacts (B = -0.33, p = .003; B = -0.22, p = .02) were 
associated with physical and mental fatigue at the same measurement point. 
Performing household chores decreased physical and mental fatigue (B = -0.29, 
p = .02; B = -0.30, p = .006) two hours later on the same day, whereas eating 
and drinking increased physical fatigue (B = 0.20, p = .05) two hours later on 
the same day.
CONCLUSION: Physical fatigue and mental fatigue were strongly associated and 
revealed fluctuations in fatigue levels between individuals, which might suggest 
potentially different post-COVID subgroups. Indications for potential risk and 
beneficial behaviours for fatigue were found.

Fabry disease is caused by a deficiency of α-galactosidase A (GLA) leading to 
the lysosomal accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and other 
glycosphingolipids. Fabry patients experience significant damage to the heart, 
kidney, and blood vessels that can be fatal. Here we apply directed evolution to 
generate more stable GLA variants as potential next generation treatments for 
Fabry disease. GLAv05 and GLAv09 were identified after screening more than 
12,000 GLA variants through 8 rounds of directed evolution. Both GLAv05 and 
GLAv09 exhibit increased stability at both lysosomal and blood pH, stability to 
serum, and elevated enzyme activity in treated Fabry fibroblasts (19-fold) and 
GLA-/- podocytes (10-fold). GLAv05 and GLAv09 show improved pharmacokinetics in 
mouse and non-human primates. In a Fabry mouse model, the optimized variants 
showed prolonged half-lives in serum and relevant tissues, and a decrease of 
accumulated Gb3 in heart and kidney. To explore the possibility of diminishing 
the immunogenic potential of rhGLA, amino acid residues in sequences predicted 
to bind MHC II were targeted in late rounds of GLAv09 directed evolution. An MHC 
II-associated peptide proteomics assay confirmed a reduction in displayed 
peptides for GLAv09. Collectively, our findings highlight the promise of using 
directed evolution to generate enzyme variants for more effective treatment of 
lysosomal storage diseases.

Rolling Bearing Fault Diagnosis Based on WOA-VMD-MPE and MPSO-LSSVM.

Jin Z(1), Chen G(1), Yang Z(1).

In order to further improve the accuracy of fault identification of rolling 
bearings, a fault diagnosis method based on the modified particle swarm 
optimization (MPSO) algorithm optimized least square support vector machine 
(LSSVM), combining parameter optimization variational mode decomposition (VMD) 
and multi-scale permutation entropy (MPE), was proposed. Firstly, to solve the 
problem of insufficient decomposition and mode mixing caused by the improper 
selection of mode component K and penalty factor α in VMD algorithm, the whale 
optimization algorithm (WOA) was used to optimize the penalty factor and mode 
component number in the VMD algorithm, and the optimal parameter combination (K, 
α) was obtained. Secondly, the optimal parameter combination (K, α) was used for 
the VMD of the rolling bearing vibration signal to obtain several intrinsic mode 
functions (IMFs). According to the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) 
criterion, the optimal IMF component was selected, and its optimal multi-scale 
permutation entropy was calculated to form the feature set. Finally, K-fold 
cross-validation was used to train the MPSO-LSSVM model, and the test set was 
input into the trained model for identification. The experimental results show 
that compared with PSO-SVM, LSSVM, and PSO-LSSVM, the MPSO-LSSVM fault diagnosis 
model has higher recognition accuracy. At the same time, compared with VMD-SE, 
VMD-MPE, and PSO-VMD-MPE, WOA-VMD-MPE can extract more accurate features.

Effect of SOCS3 on vocal fold fibroblast activation by regulating the JAK2/STAT3 
signalling pathway.

Li X(1), Hu R(1), Wang H(1), Xu W(2).

PURPOSE: To explore the regulation of SOCS3 in the JAK2/STAT3 pathway during 
vocal fold fibroblast activation after vocal fold injury.
METHODS: Normal vocal fold fibroblasts (VFFs), injured VFFs, and simulated 
injured VFFs (normal VFFs supplemented with transforming growth factor beta 
[TGF-β]) were treated with a JAK2 inhibitor (AG490), and SOCS3 was overexpressed 
in each group. Type I collagen (COL1), α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), SOCS3, 
JAK2, and STAT3 were detected using immunofluorescence, quantitative real-time 
polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and western blotting.
RESULTS: Compared with normal VFFs, expression of SOCS3 was lower, but 
p-JAK/p-STAT3 and JAK2/STAT3 were higher in injured and simulated injured VFFs. 
After the addition of AG490, COL1 and α-SMA expressions did not change 
significantly in normal VFFs but was significantly decreased in the other two 
groups. The protein and mRNA expression levels of SOCS3 were significantly 
increased, while those of p-JAK/p-STAT3 and JAK2/STAT3 were significantly 
decreased. When SOCS3 was overexpressed, the COL1 and α-SMA expression levels in 
normal VFFs were not altered significantly, whereas they were significantly 
decreased in injured and simulated injured VFFs. The expression of 
p-JAK2/p-STAT3 significantly decreased when SOCS3 was overexpressed in injured 
and simulated injured VFFs.
CONCLUSION: SOCS3 may regulate the activation of JAK2/STATA3 pathway after vocal 
fold injury. In addition, SOCS3 may inhibit excessive activation of vocal fold 
fibroblasts by downregulating JAK2/STAT3 in the early stages of vocal fold 
injury.

Targeted alpha therapy with the (224)Ra/(212)Pb-TCMC-TP-3 dual alpha solution in 
a multicellular tumor spheroid model of osteosarcoma.

Tornes AJK(1)(2)(3), Stenberg VY(1)(2)(3), Larsen RH(2), Bruland ØS(3)(4), 
Revheim ME(3)(5), Juzeniene A(1)(6).

Osteosarcoma patients with overt metastases at primary diagnosis have a 5-year 
survival rate of less than 20%. TP-3 is a murine IgG2b monoclonal antibody with 
high affinity for an epitope residing on the p80 osteosarcoma cell surface 
membrane antigen. The tumor-associated antigen p80 is overexpressed in 
osteosarcomas, and has very low normal tissue expression. We propose a novel 
dual alpha targeting solution containing two radionuclides from the same decay 
chain, including the bone-seeking 224Ra, and cancer cell-surface seeking 
212Pb-TCMC-TP-3 for the treatment of osteoblastic bone cancers, circulating 
cancer cells and micrometastases. In this in vitro study, the cytotoxic effects 
of 212Pb-TCMC-TP-3 (single alpha solution) and 224Ra/212Pb-TCMC-TP-3 (dual alpha 
solution) were investigated in a multicellular spheroid model mimicking 
micrometastatic disease in osteosarcoma. OHS spheroids with diameters of 253 ± 
98 μm treated with 4.5, 2.7, and 3.3 kBq/ml of 212Pb-TCMC-TP-3 for 1, 4, and 24 
h, respectively, were disintegrated within 3 weeks. The 212Pb-TCMC-TP-3 induced 
a 7-fold delay in spheroid doubling time compared to a 28-times higher dose with 
the non-specific 212Pb-TCMC-rituximab. The 224Ra/212Pb-TCMC-TP-3 completely 
disintegrated spheroids with diameters of 218-476 μm within 3 and 2 weeks after 
4 and 24 h incubation with 5 kBq/ml, respectively. Treatment with 1 kBq/ml of 
224Ra/212Pb-TCMC-TP-3 for 24 h caused an 11.4-fold reduction in spheroid 
viability compared with unconjugated 224Ra/212Pb. The single and dual alpha 
solutions with TP-3 showed cytotoxicity in spheroids of clinically relevant 
size, which warrant further testing of the dual alpha solution using in vivo 
osteosarcoma models.

Nano-assemblies enhance chaperone activity, stability, and delivery of alpha 
B-crystallin-D3 (αB-D3).

Upadhyay AK(1), Mueller NH(2), Petrash JM(2), Kompella UB(3).

Crystallins, small heat shock chaperone proteins that prevent protein 
aggregation, are of potential value in treating protein aggregation disorders. 
However, their therapeutic use is limited by their low potency and poor 
intracellular delivery. One approach to facilitate the development of 
crystallins is to improve their activity, stability, and delivery. In this 
study, zinc addition to αB-crystallin-D3 (αB-D3) formed supramolecular nano- and 
micro- assemblies, induced dose-dependent changes in structure (beta-sheet to 
alpha-helix) and increased surface hydrophobicity and chemical stability. 
Further, crystallin assemblies exhibited a size-dependent chaperone activity, 
with the nano-assemblies being superior to micro-assemblies and 4.3-fold more 
effective than the native protein in preventing β-mercaptoethanol induced 
aggregation of insulin. Insulin rescued by crystallin assemblies retained the 
activity as evidenced by glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 cells. The most active 
nano-assemblies enhanced protein stability, in the presence of urea, by 
1.6-fold, whereas intracellular delivery was enhanced by 3.0-fold. The αB-D3 
crystallin nano-assemblies exhibit uniquely enhanced stability, activity, and 
delivery compared to the native protein.

MAPKs/AP-1, not NF-κB, is responsible for MCP-1 production in TNF-α-activated 
adipocytes.

Zhang X(1), Liu Z(1), Li W(1), Kang Y(1), Xu Z(1), Li X(1), Gao Y(1), Qi Y(1).

Obesity is associated with the infiltration of monocytes/macrophages into 
adipose tissue in which MCP-1 plays a crucial role. But the regulatory mechanism 
of MCP-1 expression in adipocytes is not well defined. Our results demonstrated 
that TNF-α induced abundant MCP-1 production in adipocytes, including 3T3-L1 
pre- (≈ 9 to 18-fold), mature adipocytes (≈ 4 to 6-fold), and primary 
adipocytes(< 2-fold), among which 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes showed the best 
reactiveness. Thus, 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes were used for the most of following 
experiments. At the transcriptional level, TNF-α (20 ng/mL) also promoted the 
mRNA expression of MCP-1. It is well recognized that the engagement of TNF-α 
with its receptor can trigger both NF-κB and AP-1 signalling, which was also 
confirmed in our study (5-fold and 2-fold). Unexpectedly and counterintuitively, 
multiple NF-κB inhibitors with different mechanisms failed to suppress 
TNF-α-induced MCP-1 production, but rather the inhibitors for any one of MAPKs 
(JNK, ERK and p38) could do. This study, for the first time, reveals that 
MAPKs/AP-1 but not NF-κB signalling is responsible for MCP-1 production in 
TNF-α-activated adipocytes. These findings provide important insight into the 
role of AP-1 signalling in adipose tissue, and may lead to the development of 
therapeutical repositioning strategies in metaflammation.Abbreviations: AP-1,

Measuring pain and nociception: Through the glasses of a computational 
scientist. Transdisciplinary overview of methods.

Kutafina E(1)(2), Becker S(3)(4)(5), Namer B(6)(7).

In a healthy state, pain plays an important role in natural biofeedback loops 
and helps to detect and prevent potentially harmful stimuli and situations. 
However, pain can become chronic and as such a pathological condition, losing 
its informative and adaptive function. Efficient pain treatment remains a 
largely unmet clinical need. One promising route to improve the characterization 
of pain, and with that the potential for more effective pain therapies, is the 
integration of different data modalities through cutting edge computational 
methods. Using these methods, multiscale, complex, and network models of pain 
signaling can be created and utilized for the benefit of patients. Such models 
require collaborative work of experts from different research domains such as 
medicine, biology, physiology, psychology as well as mathematics and data 
science. Efficient work of collaborative teams requires developing of a common 
language and common level of understanding as a prerequisite. One of ways to 
meet this need is to provide easy to comprehend overviews of certain topics 
within the pain research domain. Here, we propose such an overview on the topic 
of pain assessment in humans for computational researchers. Quantifications 
related to pain are necessary for building computational models. However, as 
defined by the International Association of the Study of Pain (IASP), pain is a 
sensory and emotional experience and thus, it cannot be measured and quantified 
objectively. This results in a need for clear distinctions between nociception, 
pain and correlates of pain. Therefore, here we review methods to assess pain as 
a percept and nociception as a biological basis for this percept in humans, with 
the goal of creating a roadmap of modelling options.

Inhibition of growth and contraction in human prostate stromal cells by 
silencing of NUAK1 and -2, and by the presumed NUAK inhibitors HTH01-015 and 
WZ4003.

S(1), Trieb M(1), Waidelich R(1), Strittmatter F(1), Stief CG(1), Hennenberg 
M(1).

Background: NUAKs promote myosin light chain phosphorlyation, actin 
organization, proliferation and suppression of cell death in non-muscle cells, 
which are critical for smooth muscle contraction and growth. In benign prostatic 
hyperplasia (BPH), contraction and growth in the prostate drive urethral 
obstruction and voiding symptoms. However, a role of NUAKs in smooth muscle 
contraction or prostate functions are unknown. Here, we examined effects of NUAK 
silencing and the presumed NUAK inhibitors, HTH01-015 and WZ4003 on contraction 
and growth-related functions in prostate stromal cells (WPMY-1) and in human 
prostate tissues. Methods: Effects of NUAK1 and -2 silencing, HTH01-015 and 
WZ4003 on matrix plug contraction, proliferation (EdU assay, Ki-67 mRNA), 
apoptosis and cell death (flowcytometry), viability (CCK-8) and actin 
organization (phalloidin staining) were examined in cultured WPMY-1 cells. 
Effects of HTH01-015 and WZ4003 on smooth muscle contraction were assessed in 
organ bath experirments with human prostate tissues. Results: Effects of 
silencing were most pronounced on proliferation and cell death, resulting in 
decreases of proliferation rate by 60% and 70% by silencing of NUAK1 and NUAK2 
(compared to scramble siRNA-transfected controls), decreases in Ki-67 by 75% and 
77%, while numbers of dead cells after silencing of NUAK1 and NUAK2 amounted to 
2.8 and 4.9 fold of scramble-transfected controls. Silencing of each isoform was 
paralleled by reduced viability, breakdown in actin polymerization, and partial 
decreases in contractility (maximally 45% by NUAK1 silencing, 58% by NUAK2 
silencing). Effects of silencing were mimicked by HTH01-015 and WZ4003, with 
numbers of dead cells amounting up to 16.1 fold or 7.8 fold with HTH01-015 or 
WZ4003, compared to solvent-treated controls. Using concentrations of 500 nM, 
neurogenic contractions of prostate tissues were inhibited partly by HTH01-015 
and U46619-induced contractions were inhibited partly by HTH01-015 and WZ4003, 
while α1-adrenergic and endothelin-1-induced contractions remained unaffected. 
Using 10 μM, inhibition of endothelin-1-induced contractions by both inhibitors 
and inhibition of α1-adrenergic contractions by HTH01-015 added to effects seen 
by 500 nM. Conclusion: NUAK1 and -2 suppress cell death and promote 
proliferation in prostate stromal cells. A role in stromal hyperplasia appears 
possible in BPH. Effects of NUAK silencing are mimicked by HTH01-015 and WZ4003.

Synthesis and Evaluation of Marine Natural Product-Inspired Meroterpenoids with 
Selective Activity toward Dormant Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Si A(1), Landgraf AD(1), Geden S(2), Sucheck SJ(1), Rohde KH(2).

Tuberculosis is a disease caused primarily by the organism Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis (Mtb), which claims about 1.5 million lives every year. A challenge 
that impedes the elimination of this pathogen is the ability of Mtb to remain 
dormant after primary infection, thus creating a reservoir for the disease in 
the population that reactivates under more ideal conditions. A better 
understanding of the physiology of dormant Mtb and therapeutics able to kill 
these phenotypically tolerant bacilli will be critical for completely 
eradicating Mtb. Our groups are focusing on characterizing the activity of 
derivatives of the marine natural product (+)-puupehenone (1). Recently, the 
Rohde group reported that puupehedione (2) and 15-α-methoxypuupehenol (3) 
exhibit enhanced activity in an in vitro multi-stress dormancy model of Mtb. To 
optimize the antimycobacterial activity of these terpenoids, novel 15-α-methoxy- 
and 15-α-acetoxy-puupehenol esters were prepared from (+)-puupehenone (1) 
accessed through a (+)-sclareolide-derived β-hydroxyl aldehyde. For added 
diversity, various congeners related to (1) were also prepared from a common 
borono-sclareolide donor, which resulted in the synthesis of epi-puupehenol and 
the natural products (+)-chromazonarol and (+)-yahazunol. In total, we generated 
a library of 24 compounds, of which 14 were found to be active against Mtb, and 
the most active compounds retained the enhanced activity against dormant Mtb 
seen in the parent compound. Several of the 15-α-methoxy- and 
15-α-acetoxy-puupehenol esters possessed potent activity against actively 
dividing and dormant Mtb. Intriguingly, the closely related triisobutyl 
derivative 16 showed similar activity to 1 in actively dividing Mtb but lost 
about 178-fold activity against dormant Mtb. However, the monopivaloyl compound 
13 showed a modest 3- to 4-fold loss in activity in both actively dividing and 
dormant Mtb relative to the activity of 1 revealing the importance of the free 
OH at C19 supporting the potential role of quinone methide formation as critical 
for activity in dormant Mtb. Elucidating important structure-activity 
relationships and the mechanism of action of this natural product-inspired 
chemical series may yield insights into vulnerable drug targets in dormant 
bacilli and new therapeutics to more effectively target dormant Mtb.

Atorvastatin attenuates ferroptosis-dependent myocardial injury and inflammation 
following coronary microembolization via the Hif1a/Ptgs2 pathway.

Liu T(1), Shu J(1), Liu Y(2), Xie J(1), Li T(1), Li H(3), Li L(1)(4).

Objectives: Coronary microembolization (CME) represents a serious periprocedural 
complication after percutaneous coronary intervention. Ferroptosis has been 
identified in multiple cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we aimed to 
investigate the effects of atorvastatin (ATV) on ferroptosis and inflammation 
following CME and elucidate the underlying mechanism. Methods: We established a 
rat model of CME by injecting microspheres into the left ventricle. Deferoxamine 
(DFO), a selective ferroptosis inhibitor, or ATV was pretreated before modeling. 
Cardiac function and cardiac troponin T (cTnT) levels were detected. Levels of 
ferroptosis-associated genes, malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), and 
ferrous iron (Fe2+) were measured to validate ferroptosis. Levels of tumor 
necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) were assayed to 
determine the inflammation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed to 
determine the binding of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 subunit alpha (Hif1a) to the 
promoter of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase-2 (Ptgs2). Results: Ferroptosis 
and inflammation were induced following CME with increased levels of MDA (∼2.5 
fold, p < 0.01), Fe2+ (∼1.5 fold, p < 0.01), TNF-α, and IL-1β and decreased GSH 
levels (∼42%, p < 0.01). Meanwhile, the level of Ptgs2 was significantly 
increased, while those of glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4) and solute carrier 
family 7 member 11 (Slc7a11) were decreased. The level of cTnT was increased by 
7-fold (p < 0.01). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was significantly 
reduced (∼85% in the sham group versus ∼45% in the CME group, p < 0.01). DFO or 
Ptgs2 silencing inhibited the increase of MDA, Ptgs2, TNF-α, and IL-1β, and 
induced the levels of GSH and Gpx4, followed by reduction in cTnT levels by 
approximately 50% (p < 0.01). LVEF was improved by approximately 2 fold (p < 
0.01). Mechanistically, the transcription factor Hif1a bound to the promoter of 
Ptgs2 and upregulated its expression. In addition, ATV inhibited the activation 
of the Hif1a/Ptgs2 axis and attenuated cardiac ferroptosis and inflammation, 
thus ameliorating CME-induced myocardial injury (LVEF, ∼34% elevation; cTnT, 
∼1.8 fold decrease, p < 0.01). Conclusion: Atorvastatin ameliorates 
ferroptosis-mediated myocardial injury and inflammation following CME via the 
Hif1a/Ptgs2 pathway.

Integrating unsupervised language model with triplet neural networks for protein 
gene ontology prediction.

Zhu YH(1)(2), Zhang C(2), Yu DJ(1), Zhang Y(2)(3).

Accurate identification of protein function is critical to elucidate life 
mechanisms and design new drugs. We proposed a novel deep-learning method, ATGO, 
to predict Gene Ontology (GO) attributes of proteins through a triplet 
neural-network architecture embedded with pre-trained language models from 
protein sequences. The method was systematically tested on 1068 non-redundant 
benchmarking proteins and 3328 targets from the third Critical Assessment of 
Protein Function Annotation (CAFA) challenge. Experimental results showed that 
ATGO achieved a significant increase of the GO prediction accuracy compared to 
the state-of-the-art approaches in all aspects of molecular function, biological 
process, and cellular component. Detailed data analyses showed that the major 
advantage of ATGO lies in the utilization of pre-trained transformer language 
models which can extract discriminative functional pattern from the feature 
embeddings. Meanwhile, the proposed triplet network helps enhance the 
association of functional similarity with feature similarity in the sequence 
embedding space. In addition, it was found that the combination of the network 
scores with the complementary homology-based inferences could further improve 
the accuracy of the predicted models. These results demonstrated a new avenue 
for high-accuracy deep-learning function prediction that is applicable to 
large-scale protein function annotations from sequence alone.

Many dissimilar NusG protein domains switch between α-helix and β-sheet folds.

Porter LL(1)(2), Kim AK(3), Rimal S(3)(4), Looger LL(5), Majumdar A(6), Mensh 
BD(5), Starich MR(4), Strub MP(4).

Folded proteins are assumed to be built upon fixed scaffolds of secondary 
structure, α-helices and β-sheets. Experimentally determined structures of 
>58,000 non-redundant proteins support this assumption, though it has recently 
been challenged by ~100 fold-switching proteins. Though ostensibly rare, these 
proteins raise the question of how many uncharacterized proteins have 
shapeshifting-rather than fixed-secondary structures. Here, we use a comparative 
sequence-based approach to predict fold switching in the universally conserved 
NusG transcription factor family, one member of which has a 50-residue 
regulatory subunit experimentally shown to switch between α-helical and β-sheet 
folds. Our approach predicts that 24% of sequences in this family undergo 
similar α-helix ⇌ β-sheet transitions. While these predictions cannot be 
reproduced by other state-of-the-art computational methods, they are confirmed 
by circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy for 10 out of 
10 sequence-diverse variants. This work suggests that fold switching may be a 
pervasive mechanism of transcriptional regulation in all kingdoms of life.

NetSurfP-3.0: accurate and fast prediction of protein structural features by 
protein language models and deep learning.

Høie MH(1), Kiehl EN(1), Petersen B(2)(3), Nielsen M(1), Winther O(4)(5)(6), 
Nielsen H(1), Hallgren J(7), Marcatili P(1).

Recent advances in machine learning and natural language processing have made it 
possible to profoundly advance our ability to accurately predict protein 
structures and their functions. While such improvements are significantly 
impacting the fields of biology and biotechnology at large, such methods have 
the downside of high demands in terms of computing power and runtime, hampering 
their applicability to large datasets. Here, we present NetSurfP-3.0, a tool for 
predicting solvent accessibility, secondary structure, structural disorder and 
backbone dihedral angles for each residue of an amino acid sequence. This 
NetSurfP update exploits recent advances in pre-trained protein language models 
to drastically improve the runtime of its predecessor by two orders of 
magnitude, while displaying similar prediction performance. We assessed the 
accuracy of NetSurfP-3.0 on several independent test datasets and found it to 
consistently produce state-of-the-art predictions for each of its output 
features, with a runtime that is up to to 600 times faster than the most 
commonly available methods performing the same tasks. The tool is freely 
available as a web server with a user-friendly interface to navigate the 
results, as well as a standalone downloadable package.

Immune response modulation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa persister cells.

Hastings CJ(1)(2), Himmler GE(1)(2), Patel A(1)(2), Marques CNH(1)(2).

Update in
    mBio. 2023 Mar 15;:e0005623.

Bacterial persister cells - a metabolically dormant subpopulation tolerant to 
antimicrobials - contribute to chronic infections and are thought to evade host 
immunity. In this work, we studied the ability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
persister cells to withstand host innate immunity. We found that persister cells 
resist MAC-mediated killing by the complement system despite being bound by 
complement protein C3b at levels similar to regular vegetative cells, in part 
due to reduced bound C5b - and are engulfed at a lower rate (10-100 fold), even 
following opsonization. Once engulfed, persister cells resist killing and, 
contrary to regular vegetative cells which induce a M1 favored 
(CD80+/CD86+/CD206-, high levels of CXCL-8, IL-6, and TNF-α) macrophage 
polarization, they initially induce a M2 favored macrophage polarization 
(CD80+/CD86+/CD206+, high levels of IL-10, and intermediate levels of CXCL-8, 
IL-6, and TNF-α), which is skewed towards M1 favored polarization (high levels 
of CXCL-8 and IL-6, lower levels of IL-10) by 24 hours of infection, once 
persister cells awaken. Overall, our findings further establish the ability of 
persister cells to evade the innate host response and to contribute chronic 
infections.

OBJECTIVES: One symptom of hypertrophic scar (HTS) that can develop after burn 
injury is dyschromia with hyper- and hypopigmentation. There are limited 
treatments for these conditions. Previously, we showed there is no expression of 
alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) in hypopigmented scars, and if 
these melanocytes are treated with synthetic α-MSH in vitro, they respond by 
repigmenting. The current study tested the same hypothesis in the in vivo 
environment using laser-assisted drug delivery (LADD).
METHODS: HTSs were created in red Duroc pigs. At Day 77 (pre), they were treated 
with CO2 fractional ablative laser (FLSR). Synthetic α-MSH was delivered as a 
topical solution dissolved in  l-tyrosine (n = 6, treated). Control scars 
received LADD of  l-tyrosine only (n = 2, control). Scars were treated and 
examined weekly through Week 4. Digital images and punch biopsies of hyper, 
hypo-, and normally pigmented scar and skin were collected. Digital pictures 
were analyzed with ImageJ by tracing the area of hyperpigmentation. Epidermal 
sheets were obtained from punch biopsies through dispase separation and RNA was 
isolated. qRT-PCR was run for melanogenesis-related genes: tyrosinase (TYR), 
tyrosinase-related protein-1 (TYRP1), and dopachrome tautomerase (DCT). Two-way 
ANOVA with multiple comparisons and Dunnett's correction compared the groups.
RESULTS: The areas of hyperpigmentation were variable before treatment. 
Therefore, data is represented as fold-change where each scar was normalized to 
its own pre value. Within the LADD of NDP α-MSH + l-tyrosine group, 
hyperpigmented areas gradually increased each week, reaching 1.3-fold over pre 
by Week 4. At each timepoint, area of hyperpigmentation was greater in the 
treated versus the control (1.04 ± 0.05 vs. 0.89 ± 0.08, 1.21 ± 0.07 vs. 
0.98 ± 0.24, 1.21 ± 0.08 vs. 1.04 ± 0.11, 1.28 ± 0.11 vs. 0.94 ± 0.25; 
fold-change from pre-). Within the treatment group, pretreatment, levels of TYR 
were decreased -17.76 ± 4.52 below the level of normal skin in hypopigmented 
scars. After 1 treatment, potentially due to laser fractionation, the levels 
decreased to -43.49 ± 5.52. After 2, 3, and 4 treatments, there was ever 
increasing levels of TYR to almost the level of normally pigmented skin 
(-35.74 ± 15.72, -23.25 ± 6.80, -5.52 ± 2.22 [p < 0.01, Week 4]). This pattern 
was also observed for TYRP1 (pre = -12.94 ± 1.82, Week 1 = -48.85 ± 13.25 
[p < 0.01], Weeks 2, 3, and 4 = -34.45 ± 14.64, -28.19 ± 4.98, -6.93 ± 3.05 
[p < 0.01, Week 4]) and DCT (pre = -214.95 ± 89.42, Week 1 = -487.93 ± 126.32 
[p < 0.05], Weeks 2, 3, and 4 = -219.06 ± 79.33, -72.91 ± 20.45 [p < 0.001], 
-76.00 ± 24.26 [p < 0.001]). Similar patterns were observed for scars treated 
with LADD of  l-tyrosine alone without NDP α-MSH. For each gene, in 
hyperpigmented scar, levels increased at Week 4 of treatment compared to Week 1 
(p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: A clinically-relevant FLSR treatment method can be combined with 
topical delivery of synthetic α-MSH and l-tyrosine to increase the area of 
pigmentation and expression of melanogenesis genes in hypopigmented HTS. LADD 
of  l-tyrosine alone leads to increased expression of melanogenesis genes. 
Future studies will aim to optimize drug delivery, timing, and dosing.

Thiolated cyclodextrins: A comparative study of their mucoadhesive properties.

Fürst A(1), Kali G(1), Efiana NA(1), Akkuş-Dağdeviren ZB(1), Haddadzadegan S(1), 
Bernkop-Schnürch A(2).

AIM: The aim of this study was the comparison of the mucoadhesive properties of 
nonionic, negatively, and positively charged thiolated cyclodextrins (CDs), 
including α-, β-, and γ-CDs of low and high degree of thiolation.
METHODS: Native α-, β-, and γ-CDs were thiolated with phosphorous pentasulfide 
in sulfolane (CD-SH) (i), via reductive amination with cysteamine after 
oxidative ring opening (CD-Cya) (ii), and via esterification with 
mercaptosuccinic acid (CD-MSA) (iii). These thiolated CDs were characterized via 
1H NMR and Ellman's test. Cytotoxicity was determined via resazurin and 
hemolysis assay. Mucoadhesive properties were evaluated via rheological studies 
with freshly isolated porcine mucus, as well as residence time studies on 
porcine small intestinal mucosa.
RESULTS: The structure of thiolated CDs was confirmed via 1H NMR. The degree of 
thiolation was in the range of 594-1034 µmol/g for low and 1360-3379 µmol/g for 
high CD-SH, whereas thiolated CD-Cya and thiolated CD-MSA exhibited a degree of 
thiolation of 1142-3242 µmol/g and 243-1227 µmol/g, respectively. Just cationic 
CDs showed cytotoxicity. Nonionic highly thiolated α-CD-SH, α-CD-Cya, and 
α-CD-MSA exhibited with mucus 5.6-, 15.7- and 2.8-fold improved dynamic 
viscosity, while improvement was 7.7-, 6.1-, and 5.4-fold for the corresponding 
thiolated β-CDs and 12.3-, 15.4- and 17.8-fold for the corresponding thiolated 
γ-CDs compared with native CDs, respectively. A prolonged mucosal residence time 
following the rank order γ > β > α was observed for all thiolated CDs, whereby 
γ-CD-Cya, nonionic highly thiolated β-CD-SH and α-CD-Cya showed the highest 
mucoadhesive properties.
CONCLUSION: A high degree of thiolation and the introduction of cationic charges 
are mainly responsible for high mucoadhesive properties of CDs.

Hydrogen sulfide alleviates lipopolysaccharide-induced myocardial injury through 
TLR4-NLRP3 pathway.

Xia Y(1), Zhang W, He K, Bai L, Miao Y, Liu B, Zhang X, Jin S, Wu Y.

To investigate the effect of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) on myocardial injury in 
sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction (SIMD), male C57BL/6 mice were 
intraperitoneally injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (10 mg/kg, i.p.) to 
induce cardiac dysfunction without or with the H2S donor sodium hydrosulfide 
(NaHS) (50 µmol/kg, i.p.) administration 3 h after LPS injection. Six hours 
after the LPS injection, echocardiography, cardiac hematoxylin and eosin (HE) 
staining, myocardial damage and inflammatory biomarkers and Western blot results 
were analyzed. In mice, the administration of LPS decreased left ventricular 
ejection fraction (LVEF) by 30 % along with lowered H2S levels (35 % reduction). 
It was observed that cardiac troponin I (cTnI), tumor necrosis factor-alpha 
(TNF-alpha), and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) levels were all increased (by 
0.22-fold, 2000-fold and 0.66-fold respectively). HE staining revealed 
structural damage and inflammatory cell infiltration in the myocardial tissue 
after LPS administration. Moreover, after 6 h of LPS treatment, toll-like 
receptor 4 (TLR4) and nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) expressions were 
up-regulated 2.7-fold and 1.6-fold respectively. When compared to the septic 
mice, NaHS enhanced ventricular function (by 0.19-fold), decreased cTnI, 
TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta levels (by 11 %, 33 %, and 16 % respectively) and 
downregulated TLR4 and NLRP3 expressions (by 64 % and 31 % respectively). 
Furthermore, NaHS did not further improve cardiac function and inflammation in 
TLR4-/- mice or mice in which NLRP3 activation was inhibited by MCC950, after 
LPS injection. In conclusion, these findings imply that decreased endogenous H2S 
promotes the progression of SIMD, whereas exogenous H2S alleviates SIMD by 
inhibiting inflammation via the TLR4-NLRP3 pathway suppression.

Metabolic detoxification and ace-1 target site mutations associated with 
acetamiprid resistance in Aedes aegypti L.

Samal RR(1), Panmei K(1), Lanbiliu P(1), Kumar S(1).

Despite the continuous use of chemical interventions, Aedes-borne diseases 
remain on the rise. Neonicotinoids are new, safer, and relatively effective 
pharmacological interventions against mosquitoes. Neonicotinoids interact with 
the postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) of the insect 
central nervous system, but the absence of nAChR polymorphism in resistant 
phenotypes makes their involvement in neonicotinoid resistance uncertain. Thus, 
an investigation was carried out to understand the role of metabolic 
detoxification and target site insensitivity in imparting acetamiprid resistance 
in Aedes aegypti larvae. Studies were conducted on the parent susceptible strain 
(PS), acetamiprid-larval selected strain for five generations (ACSF-5; 8.83-fold 
resistance) and 10 generations (ACSF-10; 19.74-fold resistance) of Ae. aegypti. 
The larval selection raised α-esterase and β-esterase activities by 1.32-fold 
and 1.34-fold, respectively, in ACSF-10 as compared to PS, while the 
corresponding glutathione-S-transferase and acetylcholinesterase activity 
increased by 22.5 and 2%. The ace-1 gene in PS and ACSF-10 showed four 
mismatches in the 1312-1511 bp region due to mutations in the Y455C codon 
(tyrosine to cysteine) at the 1367th position (TAC→TGC); I457V codon (isoleucine 
to valine) at 1372 bp and 1374 bp (ATA→GTG); and R494M codon (arginine to 
methionine) at 1484 bp (AGG→ATG). The R494M mutation was the novel and dominant 
type, observed in 70% ACSF-10 population, and has not been reported so far. The 
studies evidenced the combination of metabolic detoxification and target site 
mutation in imparting acetamiprid resistance in Ae. aegypti.

Relations between emotion regulation strategies and affect in daily life: A 
systematic review and meta-analysis of studies using ecological momentary 
assessments.

Boemo T(1), Nieto I(2), Vazquez C(3), Sanchez-Lopez A(4).

Emotion regulation (ER) is a central target in the study of psychological and 
neurobiological processes of emotions for numerous psychological disorders. 
Ecological momentary assessments, overcoming retrospective self-reports, allow a 
better understanding of the relation between the use of ER strategies and daily 
life affective experiences. A systematic review and meta-analyses of studies 
testing these relations through experience sampling methods (ESM) and daily 
diaries were conducted. ESM studies showed significant large effect sizes in 
contemporaneous relations between negative affect (NA) and rumination, 
suppression, and worry, and in both contemporaneous and prospective relations 
between positive affect (PA) and reappraisal; medium effect sizes in prospective 
relations between NA and rumination, and PA and distraction; and a small effect 
size in the prospective relation between NA and suppression. Daily diary studies 
showed significant large effect sizes in contemporaneous relations between NA 
and rumination and suppression, and in both contemporaneous and prospective 
relations between PA and reappraisal; medium effect sizes in contemporaneous 
relations between PA and acceptance, and problem-solving; and a small effect 
size in the prospective relation between NA and reappraisal. These findings shed 
light on the temporal relations between the use of ER strategies and affective 
experiences and highlight conceptual and methodological limitations in the 
field.

BERN2: an advanced neural biomedical named entity recognition and normalization 
tool.

Sung M(1), Jeong M(1), Choi Y(1), Kim D(2), Lee J(1), Kang J(1)(3).

In biomedical natural language processing, named entity recognition (NER) and 
named entity normalization (NEN) are key tasks that enable the automatic 
extraction of biomedical entities (e.g. diseases and drugs) from the 
ever-growing biomedical literature. In this article, we present BERN2 (Advanced 
Biomedical Entity Recognition and Normalization), a tool that improves the 
previous neural network-based NER tool by employing a multi-task NER model and 
neural network-based NEN models to achieve much faster and more accurate 
inference. We hope that our tool can help annotate large-scale biomedical texts 
for various tasks such as biomedical knowledge graph construction.

BepiPred-3.0: Improved B-cell epitope prediction using protein language models.

Clifford JN(1), Høie MH(1), Deleuran S(1), Peters B(2), Nielsen M(1), Marcatili 
P(1).

B-cell epitope prediction tools are of great medical and commercial interest due 
to their practical applications in vaccine development and disease diagnostics. 
The introduction of protein language models (LMs), trained on unprecedented 
large datasets of protein sequences and structures, tap into a powerful numeric 
representation that can be exploited to accurately predict local and global 
protein structural features from amino acid sequences only. In this paper, we 
present BepiPred-3.0, a sequence-based epitope prediction tool that, by 
exploiting LM embeddings, greatly improves the prediction accuracy for both 
linear and conformational epitope prediction on several independent test sets. 
Furthermore, by carefully selecting additional input variables and epitope 
residue annotation strategy, performance was further improved, thus achieving 
unprecedented predictive power. Our tool can predict epitopes across hundreds of 
sequences in minutes. It is freely available as a web server and a standalone 
package at https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/service.php?BepiPred-3.0 with a 
user-friendly interface to navigate the results.

β subunit affects Na(+) and K(+) affinities of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase: Na(+) and K(+) 
affinities of a hybrid Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase composed of insect α and mammalian β 
subunits.

Homareda H(1), Suga K(1), Yamamoto-Hijikata S(1), Eishi Y(2), Ushimaru M(1), 
Hara Y(1).

The affinity for K+ of silkworm Na+/K+-ATPase, which is composed of α and β 
subunits, is remarkably lower than that of mammalian Na+/K+-ATPase, with a 
slightly higher affinity for Na+. Because the α subunit had more than 70% 
identity to the mammalian α subunit in the amino acid sequence, whereas the β 
subunit, a glycosylated protein, had less than 30% identity to the mammalian β 
subunit, it was suggested that the β subunit was involved in the affinities for 
Na+ and K+ of Na+/K+-ATPase. To confirm this hypothesis, we examined whether 
replacing the silkworm β subunit with the mammalian β subunit affected the 
affinities for Na+ and K+ of Na+/K+-ATPase. Cloned silkworm α and cloned rat β1 
were co-expressed in BM-N cells, a cultured silkworm ovary-derived cell lacking 
endogenous Na+/K+-ATPase, to construct a hybrid Na+/K+-ATPase, in which the 
silkworm β subunit was replaced with the rat β1 subunit. The hybrid 
Na+/K+-ATPase increased the affinity for K+ by 4.1-fold and for Na+ by 0.65-fold 
compared to the wild-type one. Deglycosylation of the silkworm β subunit did not 
affect the K+ affinity. These results support the involvement of the β subunit 
in the Na+ and K+ affinities of Na+/K+-ATPase.

Downregulation of Mannose-6-Phosphate Receptors in Fabry Disease Cardiomyopathy: 
A Potential Target for Enzyme Therapy Enhancement.

Frustaci A(1)(2), Verardo R(2), Scialla R(2), Bagnato G(2), Verardo M(3), 
Alfarano M(1), Russo MA(4)(5).

Background: The efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in mobilizing 
globotryaosylceramide (GB-3) from Fabry cardiomyocytes is limited. The mechanism 
involved is still obscure. Methods: Assessment of M6Pr, M6Pr-mRNA, and Ubiquitin 
has been obtained by Western blot analysis and real-time PCR of frozen 
endomyocardial biopsy samples, from 17 pts with FD, various degree of left 
ventricular hypertrophy, and maximal wall thickening (MWT) from 11.5 and 20 mm. 
The diagnosis and severity of FDCM followed definitions of GLA mutation, 
α-galactosidase A enzyme activity, cardiac magnetic resonance, and left 
ventricular endomyocardial biopsy with the quantification of myocyte hypertrophy 
and the extent of Gb-3 accumulation. All patients have received alpha or beta 
agalsidase for ≥3 years without a reduction in LV mass nor an increase in T1 
mapping at CMR. Controls were surgical biopsies from 15 patients undergoing 
mitral valve replacement. Results: Protein analysis showed mean M6Pr in FDCM to 
be 5.4-fold lower than in a normal heart (4289 ± 6595 vs. 23,581 ± 4074, p = 
0.0996) (p < 0.001): specifically, 9-fold lower in males, p = 0.009, (p < 0.001) 
and 3-fold lower in females, p = 0.5799, (p < 0.001) showing, at histology, a 
mosaic of normal and diseased cells. M6Pr-mRNA expression was normal, while 
ubiquitin showed an increase of 4.6 fold vs. controls (13,284 ± 1723 vs. 2870 ± 
690, p = 0.001) suggesting that ubiquitin-dependent post-translational 
degradation is likely responsible for the reduction of M6Pr in FDCM. Conclusion: 
M6Pr expression is remarkably reduced in FDCM as a likely result of 
post-translational degradation. This may explain the reduced efficacy of ERT and 
be a therapeutic target for the enhancement of ERT activity.

Subunit Flexibility of Multimeric von Willebrand Factor/Factor VIII Complexes.

Parker ET(1), Haberichter SL(2)(3)(4), Lollar P(1).

Von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a plasma glycoprotein that participates in 
platelet adhesion and aggregation and serves as a carrier for blood coagulation 
factor VIII (fVIII). Plasma VWF consists of a population of multimers that range 
in molecular weight from ∼ 0.55 MDa to greater than 10 MDa. The VWF multimer 
consists of a variable number of concatenated disulfide-linked ∼275 kDa 
subunits. We fractionated plasma-derived human VWF/fVIII complexes by 
size-exclusion chromatography at a pH of 7.4 and subjected them to analysis by 
sodium dodecyl sulfate agarose gel electrophoresis, sedimentation velocity 
analytical ultracentrifugation (SV AUC), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and 
multi-angle light scattering (MALS). Weight-average molecular weights, M w, were 
independently measured by MALS and by application of the Svedberg equation to SV 
AUC and DLS measurements. Estimates of the Mark-Houwink-Kuhn-Sakurada exponents 
, αs, and αD describing the functional relationship between the z-average radius 
of gyration, , weight-average sedimentation coefficient, s w, z-average 
diffusion coefficient, D z , and M w were consistent with a random coil 
conformation of the VWF multimer. Ratios of to the z-average hydrodynamic 
radius, , estimated by DLS, were calculated across an M w range from 2 to 5 MDa. 
When compared to values calculated for a semi-flexible, wormlike chain, these 
ratios were consistent with a contour length over 1000-fold greater than the 
persistence length. These results indicate a high degree of flexibility between 
domains of the VWF subunit.

Is it acceptable and feasible to measure prolonged grief disorder symptoms in 
daily life using experience sampling methodology?

Lenferink LIM(1), van Eersel JHW(2), Franzen M(3).

INTRODUCTION: Current grief research is dominated by cross-sectional studies 
assessing prolonged grief disorder (PGD) symptoms retrospectively. Examining 
grief in daily life, using Experience Sampling Methodology (ESM), may advance 
the field. Because of the lack of ESM-research on PGD, we evaluated the 
acceptability and feasibility of assessing PGD symptoms in daily life of 
bereaved people.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: ESM-items assessing PGD symptoms were developed using 
cognitive interviewing with five ESM/grief experts. Eighty bereaved adults 
completed these ESM-items five times a day for two weeks. Before and after this 
ESM-phase, interviews were administered assessing PGD retrospectively (using the 
Traumatic Grief Inventory-Clinical Administered). t-tests were performed 
comparing symptom severity of aggregated moment-to-moment recall (using 
ESM-items) with retrospective recall (based on interviews) of PGD symptoms. 
Acceptability of participating in ESM-research (assessed with the Reactions to 
Research Participation Questionnaire) was examined using descriptive statistics. 
Feasibility was evaluated by reporting compliance and retention rates.
RESULTS: Minor changes were made to the ESM-items based on expert interviews. 
Average levels of aggregated moment-to-moment recall of the symptoms "yearning" 
(d = -1.04), "preoccupation with the deceased" (d = -0.91), "marked sense of 
disbelief" (d = -0.43), and "intense loneliness" (d = -0.28) were lower compared 
with retrospective recalling these symptoms. On average, bereaved people were 
neutral about personal benefits gained through participation in this EMS-study. 
They indicated that participation did not raise emotional reactions. Compliance 
and retention rates were 60% and 65%, respectively.
DISCUSSION: Our findings indicate that whereas compliance and retention is 
challenging, using ESM to study PGD symptoms in daily life might be useful. 
Nevertheless, more research is needed.

Using language models and ontology topology to perform semantic mapping of 
traits between biomedical datasets.

Liu Y(1), Elsworth BL(2), Gaunt TR(1).

MOTIVATION: Human traits are typically represented in both the biomedical 
literature and large population studies as descriptive text strings. Whilst a 
number of ontologies exist, none of these perfectly represent the entire human 
phenome and exposome. Mapping trait names across large datasets is therefore 
time-consuming and challenging. Recent developments in language modelling have 
created new methods for semantic representation of words and phrases, and these 
methods offer new opportunities to map human trait names in the form of words 
and short phrases, both to ontologies and to each other. Here, we present a 
comparison between a range of established and more recent language modelling 
approaches for the task of mapping trait names from UK Biobank to the 
Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO), and also explore how they compare to each 
other in direct trait-to-trait mapping.
RESULTS: In our analyses of 1191 traits from UK Biobank with manual EFO 
mappings, the BioSentVec model performed best at predicting these, matching 
40.3% of the manual mappings correctly. The BlueBERT-EFO model (finetuned on 
EFO) performed nearly as well (38.8% of traits matching the manual mapping). In 
contrast, Levenshtein edit distance only mapped 22% of traits correctly. 
Pairwise mapping of traits to each other demonstrated that many of the models 
can accurately group similar traits based on their semantic similarity.

Therapeutic role of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) for the treatment and/or management 
of SARS-CoV-2-induced lung damage in hamster model.

Suresh V(1), Behera P(2), Parida D(1), Mohapatra AP(1), Das SK(3), Kumari S(3), 
Avula K(1), Mohapatra A(3), Syed GH(3), Senapati S(4).

Oxidative stress by reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been hypothesized to be 
the major mediator of SARS-CoV-2-induced pathogenesis. During infection, the 
redox homeostasis of cells is altered as a consequence of virus-induced cellular 
stress and inflammation. In such scenario, high levels of ROS bring about the 
production of pro-inflammatory molecules like IL-6, IL-1β, etc. that are 
believed to be the mediators of severe COVID-19 pathology. Based on the known 
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, mucolytic and antiviral properties of NAC, it 
has been hypothesized that NAC will have beneficial effects in COVID-19 
patients. In the current study efforts have been made to evaluate the protective 
effect of NAC in combination with remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 induced lung 
damage in the hamster model. The SARS-CoV-2 infected animals were administered 
with high (500 mg/kg/day) and low (150 mg/kg/day) doses of NAC intraperitoneally 
with and without remdesivir. Lung viral load, pathology score and expression of 
inflammatory molecules were checked by using standard techniques. The findings 
of this study show that high doses of NAC alone can significantly suppress the 
SARS-CoV-2 mediated severe lung damage (2 fold), but on the contrary, it fails 
to restrict viral load. Moreover, high doses of NAC with and without remdesivir 
significantly suppressed the expression of pro-inflammatory genes including IL-6 
(4.16 fold), IL-1β (1.96 fold), and TNF-α (5.55 fold) in lung tissues. Together, 
results of this study may guide future preclinical and clinical attempts to 
evaluate the efficacy of different doses and routes of NAC administration with 
or without other drugs against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The effects of Anisodamine-Tirofiban Combined Therapy in acute myocardial 
infarction treated with Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI).

Jiao Y(1), Fu X(2), Liu Q(3), Zhang W(4).

OBJECTIVES: To study the effects of anisodamine-tirofiban combined therapy on 
cardiac function and serological expression of serum NGF and ESM-1 in patients 
with acute myocardial infarction treated with percutaneous coronary intervention 
(PCI).
METHODS: Eighty patients with myocardial infarction treated in Cangzhou Medical 
College, Hebei, China from February 2015 to April 2017 were selected and divided 
into the control group and the research group according to the principle of 
random draw, 40 patients per group. The patients in the control group received 
symptomatic routine treatment, while the patients in the research group received 
anisodamine-tirofiban combined therapy on the top of symptomatic routine 
treatment. Differences between the two groups in TIMI flow grades, cardiac 
function, levels of NGF and ESM-1 and adverse response were observed.
RESULTS: The recovery of cardiac function in the research group was 
statistically significant with P value (p<0.05) and better than the control 
group in TIMI flow grades, myocardial perfusion capacity and cardiac function. 
The serological indicators in the research group had a higher level of NGF and a 
lower level of ESM-1 than the control group, and the differences were 
statistically significant (p<0.05). In terms of safety, neither group showed 
significant hepatorenal disorders.
CONCLUSION: The combined treatment of anisodamine-tirofiban in patients with 
acute myocardial infarction after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can 
recover NGF and ESM-1 related proteins, improve postoperative myocardial 
perfusion, and accelerate the recovery of cardiac function. It is worth 
promoting in clinic.

MAP30 and luffin-α: Novel ribosome-inactivating proteins induce plant systemic 
resistance against plant viruses.

Wei Z(1), Yang L(1), Liu W(1), Xu X(2), Ran M(3), Jin Y(4), Sun X(5).

Ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) are toxic N-glycosylase that act on 
eukaryotic and prokaryotic rRNAs, resulting in arrest protein synthesis. RIPs 
are widely found in higher plant species and display strong antiviral activity. 
Previous studies have shown that PAP and α-MMC have antiviral activity against 
TMV. However, the localization of RIPs in plant cells and the mechanism by which 
RIPs activate plant defense against several plant viruses remain unclear. In 
this study, we obtained four RIPs (the C-terminal deletion mutant of pokeweed 
antiviral proteins (PAP-c), alpha-momorcharin (α-MMC), momordica anti-HIV 
protein of 30 kDa (MAP30) and luffin-α). The subcellular localization results 
indicated that these four RIPs were located on the plant cell membrane. 
Heterologous expression of RIPs (PAP-c, α-MMC, MAP30, luffin-α) enhanced tobacco 
mosaic virus (TMV) resistance in N. benthamiana. Compared with the control 
treatment, these RIPs significantly reduced the TMV content (149-357 fold) and 
altered the movement of TMV in the leaves of N. benthamiana. At the same time, 
heterologous expression of RIPs (MAP30 and luffin-α) could relieve TMV-induced 
oxidative damage, significantly inducing the expression of plant defense genes 
including PR1 and PR2. Furthermore, application of these RIPs could inhibit the 
infection of turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) and potato virus x (PVX). Therefore, 
this study demonstrated that MAP30 and luffin-α could be considered as new, 
effective RIPs for controlling plant viruses by activating plant systemic 
defense.

Lipid- and TPGS-Based Core-Shell-Type Nanocapsules Endowed with High Paclitaxel 
Loading and Enhanced Anticancer Potential.

Katiyar SS(1), Patil R(1), Ghadi R(1), Kuche K(1), Kushwah V(1), Dora CP(1), 
Jain S(2).

The current study elucidates the improved drug loading of paclitaxel (PTX) in 
lipid- and D-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS)-based 
core-shell-type lipid nanocapsules (PTX-TPGS-LNC) for augmenting the therapeutic 
efficacy and curbing the toxicity. PTX-TPGS-LNCs were formulated by employing 
anti-solvent precipitation technique and displayed a particle size of 
162.1 ± 4.70 nm and % practical drug loading of 15.04 ± 2.44%. Electron 
microscopy revealed that PTX-TPGS-LNCs have spherical morphology and the inner 
core was surrounded by a relatively lighter region, i.e., layer of lipids and 
TPGS. The nature of loaded PTX inside the PTX-TPGS-LNC was also confirmed using 
DSC and PXRD analysis. The in vitro release study showed biphasic and sustained 
release pattern of PTX from PTX-TPGS-LNC and it showed ~ threefold higher PTX 
uptake in MCF-7 cell line in comparison to free PTX. Moreover, it was apparent 
from the cytotoxicity assay that PTX-TPGS-LNC displayed higher cytotoxicity in 
MCF-7 cells and revealed ~ 2.92-fold decrease in IC50 value as against free PTX 
when incubated for 72 h. The apoptotic index in case of PTX-TPGS-LNC 
was ~ twofold higher than free PTX. The pharmacokinetic profile of PTX-TPGS-LNC 
revealed a ~ 3.18-fold increase in t1/2 and a ~ 2.62-fold higher AUC(0→∞) 
compared to Intaxel®. Finally, treatment with PTX-TPGS-LNC demonstrated 
significant lowering in the % tumor burden and serum toxicity markers compared 
to marketed formulation Intaxel®. Thus, the lipid- and TPGS-based 
core-shell-type LNC with high PTX loading can advance the existing standards of 
therapy for overshadowing cancer.

Esm-1 mediates transcriptional polarization associated with diabetic kidney 
disease.

Gaudet A, Zheng X, Kambham N, Bhalla V.

BACKGROUND: Esm-1, endothelial cell-specific molecule-1, is a susceptibility 
gene for diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and is a cytokine- and glucose-regulated, 
secreted proteoglycan, that is notably expressed in kidney and attenuates 
inflammation and albuminuria. Esm1 has restricted expression at the vascular tip 
during development but little is known about its expression pattern in mature 
tissues, and its precise effects in diabetes.
METHODS: We utilized publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing data to 
explore the characteristics of Esm1 expression in 27,786 renal endothelial cells 
obtained from four adult human and three mouse databases. We validated our 
findings using bulk transcriptome data from an additional 20 healthy subjects 
and 41 patients with DKD and using RNAscope. Using correlation matrices, we 
relate Esm1 expression to the glomerular transcriptome and evaluated these 
matrices with systemic over-expression of Esm-1.
RESULTS: In both mice and humans, Esm1 is expressed in a subset of all renal 
endothelial cell types and represents a minority of glomerular endothelial 
cells. In patients, Esm1 (+) cells exhibit a highly conserved enrichment for 
blood vessel development genes. With diabetes, these cells are fewer in number 
and profoundly shift expression to reflect chemotaxis pathways. Analysis of 
these gene sets highlight candidate genes such as Igfbp5 for cross talk between 
cell types. We also find that diabetes induces correlations in the expression of 
large clusters of genes, within cell type-enriched transcripts. Esm1 
significantly correlates with a majority genes within these clusters, 
delineating a glomerular transcriptional polarization reflected by the magnitude 
of Esm1 deficiency. In diabetic mice, these gene clusters link Esm1 expression 
to albuminuria, and over-expression of Esm-1 reverses the expression pattern in 
many of these genes.
CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive analysis of single cell and bulk transcriptomes 
demonstrates that diabetes correlates with lower Esm1 expression and with 
changes in the functional characterization of Esm1 (+) cells. Esm1 is both a 
marker for glomerular transcriptional polarization, and a mediator that 
re-orients the transcriptional program in DKD.

Cholesterol stabilization of phospholipid vesicles against bile-induced 
solubilization.

Tai P(1), Clulow AJ(2), Boyd BJ(3), Golding M(1), Singh H(4), Everett DW(5).

Sphingomyelin (SM) and cholesterol complex to form functional liquid-ordered 
(Lo) domains. It has been suggested that the detergent resistance of these 
domains plays a key role during gastrointestinal digestion of the milk fat 
globule membrane (MFGM), which is rich in both SM and cholesterol. Small-angle 
X-ray scattering was employed to determine the structural alterations that occur 
when milk sphingomyelin (MSM)/cholesterol, egg sphingomyelin (ESM)/cholesterol, 
soy phosphatidylcholine (SPC)/cholesterol, and milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) 
phospholipid/cholesterol model bilayer systems were incubated with bovine bile 
under physiological conditions. The persistence of diffraction peaks was 
indicative of multilamellar vesicles of MSM with cholesterol concentrations > 20 
% mol, and also for ESM with or without cholesterol. The complexation of ESM 
with cholesterol is therefore capable of inhibiting the resulting vesicles from 
disruption by bile at lower cholesterol concentrations than MSM/cholesterol. 
After subtraction of background scattering by large aggregates in the bile, a 
Guinier fitting was used to determine changes in the radii of gyration (Rgs) 
over time for the biliary mixed micelles after mixing the vesicle dispersions 
with bile. Swelling of the micelles by phospholipid solubilization from vesicles 
was a function of cholesterol concentration, with less swelling of the micelles 
occurring as the cholesterol concentration was increased. With 40% mol 
cholesterol, the Rgs of the bile micelles mixed with MSM/cholesterol, 
ESM/cholesterol, and MFGM phospholipid/cholesterol were equal to the control 
(PIPES buffer + bovine bile), indicating negligible swelling of the biliary 
mixed micelles.

Therapeutic Application of an Ag-Nanoparticle-PNIPAAm-Modified Eggshell Membrane 
Construct for Dermal Regeneration and Reconstruction.

Current therapeutic treatments for the repair and/or replacement of damaged skin 
following disease or traumatic injury is severely limited. The chicken eggshell 
membrane (ESM) is a unique material: its innate physical and mechanical 
characteristics offer optimal barrier properties and, as a naturally derived 
extract, it demonstrates inherent biocompatibility/biodegradability. To further 
enhance its therapeutic and clinical potential, the ESM can be modified with the 
thermo-responsive polymer, poly(N-isopropylacrylAmide) (PNIPAAm) as well as the 
incorporation of (drug-loaded) silver nanoparticles (AgNP); essentially, by a 
simple change in temperature, the release and delivery of the NP can be targeted 
and controlled. In this study, ESM samples were isolated using a 
decellularization protocol, and the physical and mechanical characteristics were 
profiled using SEM, FT-IR, DSC and DMA. PNIPAAm was successfully grafted to the 
ESM via amidation reactions and confirmed using FT-IR, which demonstrated the 
distinctive peaks associated with Amide A (3275 cm−1), Amide B (2970 cm−1), 
Amide I (1630 cm−1), Amide II (1535 cm−1), CH2, CH3 groups, and Amide III (1250 
cm−1) peaks. Confirmation of the incorporation of AgNP onto the stratified 
membrane was confirmed visually with SEM, qualitatively using FT-IR and also via 
changes in absorbance at 380 nm using UV-Vis spectrophotometry during a 
controlled release study for 72 h. The biocompatibility and cytotoxicity of the 
novel constructs were assessed using human dermal fibroblast (HDFa) and mouse 
dermal fibroblast (L929) cells and standard cell culture assays. Metabolic 
activity assessment (i.e., MTS assay), LDH-release profiles and Live/Dead 
staining demonstrated good attachment and spreading to the samples, and high 
cell viability following 3 days of culture. Interestingly, longer-term viability 
(>5 days), the ESM-PNIPAAm and ESM-PNIPAAm (AgNP) samples showed a greater and 
sustained cell viability profile. In summary, the modified and enhanced ESM 
constructs were successfully prepared and characterized in terms of their 
physical and mechanical profiles. AgNP were successfully loaded into the 
construct and demonstrated a desirable release profile dependent on temperature 
modulation. Fibroblasts cultured on the extracted ESM samples and ESM-PNIPAAm 
demonstrated high biocompatibility in terms of high cell attachment, spreading, 
viability and proliferation rates. As such, this work summarizes the development 
of an enhanced ESM-based construct which may be exploited as a 
clinical/therapeutic wound dressing as well as a possible application as a novel 
biomaterial scaffold for drug development.

Although ovarian sex steroids could have protective roles against colorectal 
cancer (CRC) in women, little is currently known about their potential 
anti-tumorigenic effects in men. Hence, this study measured the therapeutic 
effects of 17β-oestradiol (E2) and/or progesterone (P4) against 
azoxymethane-induced CRC in male mice that were divided into (n = 10 
mice/group): negative (NC) and positive (PC) controls, E2 (580 µg/Kg/day; five 
times/week) and P4 (2.9 mg/Kg/day; five times/week) monotherapies, and 
concurrent (EP) and sequential (E/P) co-therapy groups. Both hormones were 
injected intraperitoneally to the designated groups for four consecutive weeks. 
Similar treatment protocols with E2 (10 nM) and/or P4 (20 nM) were also used in 
the SW480 and SW620 human male CRC cell lines. The PC group showed abundant 
colonic tumours alongside increased colonic tissue testosterone levels and 
androgen (AR) and oestrogen (ERα) receptors, whereas E2 and P4 levels with ERβ 
and progesterone receptor (PGR) decreased significantly compared with the NC 
group. E2 and P4 monotherapies equally increased ERβ/PGR with 
p21/Cytochrome-C/Caspase-3, reduced testosterone levels, inhibited ERα/AR and 
CCND1/survivin and promoted apoptosis relative to the PC group. Both co-therapy 
protocols also revealed better anti-cancer effects with enhanced modulation of 
colonic sex steroid hormones and their receptors, with E/P the most prominent 
protocol. In vitro, E/P regimen showed the highest increases in the numbers of 
SW480 (2.1-fold) and SW620 (3.5-fold) cells in Sub-G1 phase of cell cycle. The 
E/P co-therapy also disclosed the lowest percentages of viable SW480 cells 
(2.8-fold), whilst both co-therapy protocols equally showed the greatest SW620 
apoptotic cell numbers (5.2-fold) relative to untreated cells. Moreover, both 
co-therapy regimens revealed maximal inhibitions of cell cycle inducers, cell 
survival markers, and AR/ERα alongside the highest expression of cell cycle 
suppressors, pro-apoptotic molecules, and ERβ/PGR in both cell lines. In 
conclusion, CRC was associated with abnormal levels of colonic sex steroid 
hormones alongside aberrant protein expression of their receptors. While the 
anti-cancer effects of E2 and P4 monotherapies were equal, their combination 
protocols showed boosted tumoricidal actions against CRC in males, possibly by 
promoting ERβ and PGR-mediated androgen deprivation together with inhibition of 
ERα-regulated oncogenic pathways.

Feasibility and acceptability of experience sampling among LGBTQ+ young people 
with self-harmful thoughts and behaviours.

Williams AJ(1)(2)(3), Arcelus J(4)(5), Townsend E(2), Michail M(1).

This study was the first to determine whether it was feasible and acceptable to 
use experience sampling methods (ESM) among LGBTQ+ young people, who had current 
experiences of self-harm. Sixteen LGBTQ+ young people (16-25 years old) took 
part in the experience sampling study. This included a baseline assessment, a 
7-day ESM assessment (participants were sampled six times a day using a phone 
app), and the option of an interview at the end of the 7-day ESM assessment. 
Feasibility data was descriptively analysed, with pilot ESM data presented. 
Qualitative data was thematically analysed to determine the acceptability 
(barriers and facilitators) of taking part in this study. Study feasibility was 
assessed by enrolment rate (55.2%), participant retention across assessment 
period (100%), ESM app feasibility (87.5%), and good adherence to total number 
of ESM surveys (67.6%). Individual study adherence ranged between 43 and 95.2%. 
Study acceptability was assessed by participant interviews. Thematic analysis 
indicated four superordinate themes; (i) Self-reflection and awareness; (ii) 
Practicalities of ESM surveys; (iii) Daily timeframes; and (iv) Suggestions for 
future studies. Pilot ESM data demonstrates that there was fluctuation of 
depressive and anxiety symptoms within- and between- participants over the 
course of the study, however, greater sample power is needed for full analysis. 
This study demonstrated that ESM designs are feasible and acceptable among 
LGBTQ+ young people with current experiences of self-harm. Pilot data indicated 
that specific experiences and moods are likely to be important to self-harm. 
These potentially have a temporal influence on self-harm behaviour or ideation, 
and therefore should be examined in a fully powered sample.

A RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (CgAKT1) involved in the synthesis 
of CgIFNLP in oyster Crassostrea gigas.

Hou L(1), Qiao X(1), Li Y(1), Jin Y(1), Liu R(1), Wang S(1), Zhou K(1), Wang 
L(2), Song L(3).

The RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT) is one of the most important 
protein kinases involved in many biological processes in eukaryotes. In the 
present study, a novel AKT homologue named CgAKT1 was identified from the 
Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. The open reading frame (ORF) of CgAKT1 cDNA 
was of 1482 bp encoding a peptide with 493 amino acid residues. There were 
classical domains in the predicted CgAKT1 protein, including an N-terminal 
pleckstrin homology domain, a central catalytic domain and a C-terminal 
hydrophobic domain. The mRNA transcripts of CgAKT1 were detected in all the 
examined tissues of C. gigas with higher level in gills (8.24-fold of that in 
mantle, p < 0.05) and haemocytes (3.62-fold of that in mantle, p < 0.05). After 
poly (I:C) stimulation, the mRNA expression of CgAKT1 decreased significantly in 
haemocytes from 3 h (0.44-fold of that in the control group, p < 0.001) to 24 h 
(0.20-fold of that in the control group, p < 0.001), and then increased 
significantly at 48 h (3.65-fold of that in the control group, p < 0.05). The 
expression level of CgAKT1 mRNA increased significantly at 6 h after rCgIFNLP 
stimulation, which was 3.60-fold of that in the control group (p < 0.001). The 
Alexa Fluor 488 positive signals of CgAKT1 protein were found to be distributed 
in the cytoplasm and cell membrane of haemocytes, while those in the cytoplasm 
became weaker after poly (I:C) stimulation. In CgAKT1-RNAi oysters, the mRNA 
expression of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (CgcGAS) and TANK-binding kinase 1 
(CgTBK1) did not change significantly, but the mRNA expression level of 
stimulator of interferon gene (CgSTING), interferon regulatory factor-1 
(CgIRF-1), interferon regulatory factor-8 (CgIRF-8) and IFN-like protein 
(CgIFNLP) increased significantly, which was 1.40-fold, 1.53-fold, 1.72-fold and 
1.99-fold of that in EGFP-RNAi oysters (p < 0.05), respectively. In CgIFNLP-RNAi 
oysters, the transcripts of CgAKT1 decreased significantly compared to those in 
EGFP-RNAi oysters (0.16-fold, p < 0.01). Moreover, the expression of p-CgTBK1, 
CgSTING and CgIFNLP at the protein level in the oysters treated with p-AKT1 
activator (SC-79) was significantly suppressed after poly (I:C) stimulation. 
After the transfection of CgAKT1, the expression of p-cGAS protein in HEK293T 
cells increased significantly, while the cyclic GMP-AMP in the cells and the 
interferon (IFN-β) in the cell culture fluid decreased significantly compared 
with that in the control group. These results indicated that CgAKT1 might play a 
negative role in antiviral immunity of oyster by regulating the synthesis of 
CgIFNLP.

CollagenTransformer: End-to-End Transformer Model to Predict Thermal Stability 
of Collagen Triple Helices Using an NLP Approach.

Khare E(1)(2), Gonzalez-Obeso C(3), Kaplan DL(3), Buehler MJ(1)(4).

Collagen is one of the most important structural proteins in biology, and its 
structural hierarchy plays a crucial role in many mechanically important 
biomaterials. Here, we demonstrate how transformer models can be used to 
predict, directly from the primary amino acid sequence, the thermal stability of 
collagen triple helices, measured via the melting temperature Tm. We report two 
distinct transformer architectures to compare performance. First, we train a 
small transformer model from scratch, using our collagen data set featuring only 
633 sequence-to-Tm pairings. Second, we use a large pretrained transformer 
model, ProtBERT, and fine-tune it for a particular downstream task by utilizing 
sequence-to-Tm pairings, using a deep convolutional network to translate natural 
language processing BERT embeddings into required features. Both the small 
transformer model and the fine-tuned ProtBERT model have similar R2 values of 
test data (R2 = 0.84 vs 0.79, respectively), but the ProtBERT is a much larger 
pretrained model that may not always be applicable for other biological or 
biomaterials questions. Specifically, we show that the small transformer model 
requires only 0.026% of the number of parameters compared to the much larger 
model but reaches almost the same accuracy for the test set. We compare the 
performance of both models against 71 newly published sequences for which Tm has 
been obtained as a validation set and find reasonable agreement, with ProtBERT 
outperforming the small transformer model. The results presented here are, to 
our best knowledge, the first demonstration of the use of transformer models for 
relatively small data sets and for the prediction of specific biophysical 
properties of interest. We anticipate that the work presented here serves as a 
starting point for transformer models to be applied to other biophysical 
problems.

Semantic interoperability: ontological unpacking of a viral conceptual model.

Bernasconi A(1)(2), Guizzardi G(3)(4), Pastor O(5), Storey VC(6).

BACKGROUND: Genomics and virology are unquestionably important, but complex, 
domains being investigated by a large number of scientists. The need to 
facilitate and support work within these domains requires sharing of databases, 
although it is often difficult to do so because of the different ways in which 
data is represented across the databases. To foster semantic interoperability, 
models are needed that provide a deep understanding and interpretation of the 
concepts in a domain, so that the data can be consistently interpreted among 
researchers.
RESULTS: In this research, we propose the use of conceptual models to support 
semantic interoperability among databases and assess their ontological clarity 
to support their effective use. This modeling effort is illustrated by its 
application to the Viral Conceptual Model (VCM) that captures and represents the 
sequencing of viruses, inspired by the need to understand the genomic aspects of 
the virus responsible for COVID-19. For achieving semantic clarity on the VCM, 
we leverage the "ontological unpacking" method, a process of ontological 
analysis that reveals the ontological foundation of the information that is 
represented in a conceptual model. This is accomplished by applying the 
stereotypes of the OntoUML ontology-driven conceptual modeling language.As a 
result, we propose a new OntoVCM, an ontologically grounded model, based on the 
initial VCM, but with guaranteed interoperability among the data sources that 
employ it.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose and illustrate how the unpacking of the Viral Conceptual 
Model resolves several issues related to semantic interoperability, the 
importance of which is recognized by the "I" in FAIR principles. The research 
addresses conceptual uncertainty within the domain of SARS-CoV-2 data and 
knowledge.The method employed provides the basis for further analyses of complex 
models currently used in life science applications, but lacking ontological 
grounding, subsequently hindering the interoperability needed for scientists to 
progress their research.

Phylogeographic analysis of the Bantu language expansion supports a rainforest 
route.

Koile E(1)(2), Greenhill SJ(1)(3), Blasi DE(1)(4)(5), Bouckaert R(6), Gray 
RD(1)(7).

The Bantu expansion transformed the linguistic, economic, and cultural 
composition of sub-Saharan Africa. However, the exact dates and routes taken by 
the ancestors of the speakers of the more than 500 current Bantu languages 
remain uncertain. Here, we use the recently developed "break-away" geographical 
diffusion model, specially designed for modeling migrations, with "augmented" 
geographic information, to reconstruct the Bantu language family expansion. This 
Bayesian phylogeographic approach with augmented geographical data provides a 
powerful way of linking linguistic, archaeological, and genetic data to test 
hypotheses about large language family expansions. We compare four hypotheses: 
an early major split north of the rainforest; a migration through the Sangha 
River Interval corridor around 2,500 BP; a coastal migration around 4,000 BP; 
and a migration through the rainforest before the corridor opening, at 4,000 BP. 
Our results produce a topology and timeline for the Bantu language family, which 
supports the hypothesis of an expansion through Central African tropical forests 
at 4,420 BP (4,040 to 5,000 95% highest posterior density interval), well before 
the Sangha River Interval was open.

Generative power of a protein language model trained on multiple sequence 
alignments.

    doi: 10.1101/2022.04.14.488405.

Computational models starting from large ensembles of evolutionarily related 
protein sequences capture a representation of protein families and learn 
constraints associated to protein structure and function. They thus open the 
possibility for generating novel sequences belonging to protein families. 
Protein language models trained on multiple sequence alignments, such as MSA 
Transformer, are highly attractive candidates to this end. We propose and test 
an iterative method that directly employs the masked language modeling objective 
to generate sequences using MSA Transformer. We demonstrate that the resulting 
sequences score as well as natural sequences, for homology, coevolution, and 
structure-based measures. For large protein families, our synthetic sequences 
have similar or better properties compared to sequences generated by Potts 
models, including experimentally validated ones. Moreover, for small protein 
families, our generation method based on MSA Transformer outperforms Potts 
models. Our method also more accurately reproduces the higher-order statistics 
and the distribution of sequences in sequence space of natural data than Potts 
models. MSA Transformer is thus a strong candidate for protein sequence 
generation and protein design.

Patient-specific affect-abdominal pain interactions in endometriosis: an 
experience sampling method (ESM) study.

van Barneveld E(1)(2)(3), de Hertogh M(1), Vork L(4)(5), van Hanegem N(6), van 
Osch FHM(4)(7), Kruimel JW(4)(5), Bongers MY(1)(2)(3), Leue C(8)(9), Lim 
AC(1)(3).

OBJECTIVES: Cross-sectional studies show that endometriosis-related pain is 
associated with affect. Measuring these symptoms in real-time in a longitudinal 
perspective yields the ability to analyze the temporal relationship between 
variables. The aim was to evaluate the association between affect and abdominal 
pain, using the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) as a real-time, randomly 
repeated assessment.
METHODS: Thirty-four endometriosis patients and 31 healthy subjects completed up 
to 10 real-time self-assessments concerning abdominal pain and affective 
symptoms during seven consecutive days.
RESULTS: Endometriosis patients experienced more abdominal pain and negative 
affective symptoms, and scored lower on positive affect compared to healthy 
controls. A significant association was found between abdominal pain and both 
positive and negative affect in endometriosis patients. For healthy controls, 
less strong or non-significant associations were found. When looking at 
abdominal pain as a predictor for affect and vice versa, we found that only in 
endometriosis patients, pain was subsequently accompanied by negative affect, 
and positive affect may alleviate pain in these patients.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms a concurrent and temporal relationship between

Biomedical named entity recognition with the combined feature attention and 
fully-shared multi-task learning.

Zhang Z(1), Chen ALP(2)(3).

BACKGROUND: Biomedical named entity recognition (BioNER) is a basic and 
important task for biomedical text mining with the purpose of automatically 
recognizing and classifying biomedical entities. The performance of BioNER 
systems directly impacts downstream applications. Recently, deep neural 
networks, especially pre-trained language models, have made great progress for 
BioNER. However, because of the lack of high-quality and large-scale annotated 
data and relevant external knowledge, the capability of the BioNER system 
remains limited.
RESULTS: In this paper, we propose a novel fully-shared multi-task learning 
model based on the pre-trained language model in biomedical domain, namely 
BioBERT, with a new attention module to integrate the auto-processed syntactic 
information for the BioNER task. We have conducted numerous experiments on seven 
benchmark BioNER datasets. The proposed best multi-task model obtains F1 score 
improvements of 1.03% on BC2GM, 0.91% on NCBI-disease, 0.81% on Linnaeus, 1.26% 
on JNLPBA, 0.82% on BC5CDR-Chemical, 0.87% on BC5CDR-Disease, and 1.10% on 
Species-800 compared to the single-task BioBERT model.
CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate our model outperforms previous studies on 
all datasets. Further analysis and case studies are also provided to prove the 
importance of the proposed attention module and fully-shared multi-task learning 
method used in our model.

Energy security: the role of shale technology.

Shirazi M(1)(2).

Sustainable energy systems are sensitive to the countries' energy portfolio 
decisions, shaping geopolitics and contributing to the global energy security 
(ES). Accordingly, this paper applies the "Markov regime-switching" method to 
explore the impact of "the North American shale technology" (NAST) on behavioral 
regimes of the US energy security measurements (ESM), e.g., diversity of primary 
energy demand ([Formula: see text]), net energy import dependence ([Formula: see 
text]), non-fossil fuel resource portfolio ([Formula: see text]), and crude oil 
import dependency ([Formula: see text]). The findings confirm time-varying and 
asymmetric behavior of the US ESM before and after the NAST. Specifically, the 
overall interaction of substitution effect and scale effect of NAST strengthens 
the US energy systems through [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and 
[Formula: see text], while [Formula: see text] leads to higher risks of the US 
energy supply security. Consequently, the shale reserves development, 
diversification of primary energy demand and import supply, and advanced energy 
transport and trading policies, are suggested to overcome the barriers in 
achieving (i) availability, (ii) accessibility, (iii) affordability, and (iv) 
acceptability aspects of ES and vulnerability reduction of the US energy systems 
in respect of risk and resilience.

Kirenol alleviates diabetic nephropathy via regulating TGF-β/Smads and the NF-κB 
signal pathway.

Li J(1)(2), Zhang J(3), Yang M(3), Huang X(3), Zhang M(3), Fang X(4), Wu 
S(1)(3).

CONTEXT: Kirenol possesses anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic and anti-arthritic 
effects. However, its reno-protective effects against diabetic nephropathy (DN) 
have not been evaluated.
OBJECTIVE: This study explores the reno-protective effects of kirenol against DN 
and clarifies the potential mechanisms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The mesangial cells were treated with 20 µM kirenol and 
10 ng/mL human recombinant TGF-β1 or 30 mM glucose for 24 h. Then the cells were 
harvested to assay the expression of the target genes or proteins. Thirty 
C57BL/6J male mice were given high-fat diet with streptozotocin injection to 
induce diabetes and then were randomized into three groups (n = 10): vehicle 
administration (DM group), 2 mg/kg kirenol (DM + kirenol group) and 200 mg/kg 
metformin (Met group) for 3 months, orally. A healthy group (Con, n = 10) was 
included as the control.
RESULTS: Compared to the DM group, kirenol treatment decreased the 
phosphorylation of Smad2/3 and NF-κB (0.64- and 0.43-fold) as well as the 
accumulation of FN and Col IV (0.58- and 0.35-fold); moreover, the expression of 
IκBα was restored to normal level by kirenol treatment both in vivo and 
in vitro. After kirenol treatment, IL-6 expression was decreased 0.35- and 
0.57-fold, and TNF-α expression was decreased 0.34- and 0.46-fold, in vitro and 
in vivo, respectively. Furthermore, kirenol alleviated the glomerular basement 
membrane thickness and foot process fusion.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Kirenol could alleviate DN by downregulating the 
TGF-β/Smads and the NF-κB signal pathway. Our study provides a potential 
mechanism for the treatment of DN with kirenol.

DeepSTABp: A Deep Learning Approach for the Prediction of Thermal Protein 
Stability.

Jung F(1), Frey K(1), Zimmer D(1), Mühlhaus T(1).

Proteins are essential macromolecules that carry out a plethora of biological 
functions. The thermal stability of proteins is an important property that 
affects their function and determines their suitability for various 
applications. However, current experimental approaches, primarily thermal 
proteome profiling, are expensive, labor-intensive, and have limited proteome 
and species coverage. To close the gap between available experimental data and 
sequence information, a novel protein thermal stability predictor called 
DeepSTABp has been developed. DeepSTABp uses a transformer-based protein 
language model for sequence embedding and state-of-the-art feature extraction in 
combination with other deep learning techniques for end-to-end protein melting 
temperature prediction. DeepSTABp can predict the thermal stability of a wide 
range of proteins, making it a powerful and efficient tool for large-scale 
prediction. The model captures the structural and biological properties that 
impact protein stability, and it allows for the identification of the structural 
features that contribute to protein stability. DeepSTABp is available to the 
public via a user-friendly web interface, making it accessible to researchers in 
various fields.

Omics insights into extracellular vesicles in embryo implantation and their 
therapeutic utility.

Poh QH(1)(2), Rai A(1)(3)(4), Salamonsen LA(5)(6), Greening DW(1)(2)(3)(4)(7).

Implantation success relies on intricate interplay between the developing embryo 
and the maternal endometrium. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) represent an 
important player of this intercellular signalling through delivery of functional 
cargo (proteins and RNAs) that reprogram the target cells protein and RNA 
landscape. Functionally, the signalling reciprocity of endometrial and embryo 
EVs regulates the site of implantation, preimplantation embryo development and 
hatching, antioxidative activity, embryo attachment, trophoblast invasion, 
arterial remodelling, and immune tolerance. Omics technologies including mass 
spectrometry have been instrumental in dissecting EV cargo that regulate these 
processes as well as molecular changes in embryo and endometrium to facilitate 
implantation. This has also led to discovery of potential cargo in EVs in human 
uterine fluid (UF) and embryo spent media (ESM) of diagnostic and therapeutic 
value in implantation success, fertility, and pregnancy outcome. This review 
discusses the contribution of EVs in functional hallmarks of embryo 
implantation, and how the integration of various omics technologies is enabling 
design of EV-based diagnostic and therapeutic platforms in reproductive 
medicine.

Endocan, a Soluble Marker of Endothelial Cell Activation Is a Molecular Marker 
of Disease Severity in Women with Preeclampsia.

Cross SN(1)(2), Buhimschi IA(3)(4), Buniak CD(1)(5), Shook L(1)(5), McCarthy 
M(1)(6), Hardy J(1)(7), El-Helou Y(1)(8), Zhao G(1)(8), Buhimschi CS(1)(8).

Endocan is a proteoglycan secreted by activated endothelium that regulates 
angiogenesis via interaction with hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). We 
hypothesized that women diagnosed with preeclampsia (PE) and/or fetal growth 
restriction (FGR) have elevated circulating endocan concentrations in direct 
relationship with severity of clinical manifestations. Serum concentration of 
endocan and HGF were analyzed in 224 women grouped as healthy pregnant controls 
(P-CRL, n = 77), PE with severe features (sPE, n = 83), chronic hypertension 
(crHTN: n = 36), idiopathic FGR (n = 18), and healthy non-pregnant controls 
(NP-CRL, n = 7). Endocan and HGF measured by immunoassay were analyzed along 
with markers of inflammation, angiogenesis, and protein misfolding (urine 
congophilia). Endocan expression in the placenta and/or myometrium was studied 
by immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR. Compared to gestational age-matched 
P-CRL, women with early-onset sPE had higher circulating endocan concentrations. 
Among women with PE and/or FGR, endocan concentration correlated with soluble 
endoglin and urine congophilia but not with HGF or markers of inflammation or 
angiogenesis. In the placenta, endocan was expressed in villous and extravillous 
trophoblasts and endothelium. Intense endocan immunostaining was observed in 
plaque-like aggregations of sPE placentas complicated with FGR. In addition, 
thickened blood vessels in the myometrium of sPE patients stained positive for 
endocan. Women with early-onset sPE have elevated serum endocan likely 
reflecting chronic endothelial activation. Enhanced expression and/or deposition 
of endocan at the sites of placental injury and in remodeled maternal blood 
vessels supports a role for endocan in either vascular rescue or as a 
contributor to FGR and perhaps long-term cardiovascular morbidity.

Can you feel the excitement? Physiological correlates of students' self-reported 
emotions.

Ketonen EE(1), Salonen V(1), Lonka K(1)(2), Salmela-Aro K(1).

BACKGROUND: This study explored the physiological correlates of students' 
self-reported emotions in ecologically valid settings by combining biosignal 
data (on physical and cardiac activity) and experience sampling method (ESM) 
data.
AIMS: The aim was to examine the concurrent associations between self-reported 
excitement, calmness, anxiety, and boredom (adopted from the dimensional model 
of emotions) and students' heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) 
(indicators of physiological arousal and the activation of the autonomous 
nervous system). Students' physical activity was controlled in the models via 
the metabolic equivalent of task (MET) values (actigraphy data). A second 
objective was to explore how to combine the information stored by these three 
sources of ambulatory assessment.
SAMPLE: The study comprised 136 high school students with multiple repetitive 
data points.
METHODS: For three consecutive days, students wore biometric sensors and 
wristbands collecting their HR, HRV, and MET signals, and answered the ESM 
questionnaires five times a day on smartphones.
RESULTS: When MET values were controlled for, self-reported excitement was 
related to higher HR as well as lower HRV during a specific moment, indicating 
stronger sympathetic activity (i.e., physiological arousal/activation). 
Self-reported boredom was related to lower HR but was unrelated to HRV. 
Self-reported calmness and anxiety were unrelated to HR and HRV after 
controlling for MET.
CONCLUSIONS: A 5-min time window with a Gaussian weighted mean seemed to be an 
appropriate data processing method for capturing the physiological arousal (or 
abate) of self-reported excitement and boredom. The findings suggest that the 
physiological stimulus of elevated HR could be interpreted by students as an 
adaptive state of excitement. Combining the experience sampling approach and the 
physiological measures revealed how the mind and body function in interplay and 
can therefore provide objective evidence of emotional and motivational processes 
as they unfold in students' daily lives.

Ginsenoside Rb1 reduces oxidative/carbonyl stress damage and ameliorates 
inflammation in the lung of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.

Su H(1), Tian CJ(2), Wang Y(2), Shi J(2), Chen X(2), Zhen Z(1), Bai Y(1), Deng 
L(1), Feng C(1), Ma Z(2), Liu J(1).

CONTEXT: Ginsenoside Rb1 (Rb1) is a biologically active component of ginseng 
[Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer (Araliaceae)].
OBJECTIVE: This study determined the underlying mechanisms of Rb1 treatment that 
acted on diabetes-injured lungs in diabetic rats.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rat model was used. 
Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were divided into four groups (n = 10): control, 
Rb1 (20 mg/kg), insulin (15 U/kg to attain the euglycaemic state) and diabetic 
(untreated). After treatment for six weeks, oxidative stress assay; histological 
and ultrastructure analyses; TNF-α, TGF-β, IL-1 and IL-6 protein expression 
analyses; and the detection of apoptosis were performed.
RESULTS: There was decreased activity of SOD (3.53-fold), CAT (2.55-fold) and 
GSH (1.63-fold) and increased levels of NO (4.47-fold) and MDA (3.86-fold) in 
the diabetic group from control. Rb1 treatment increased SOD (2.4-fold), CAT 
(1.9-fold) and GSH (1.29-fold) and decreased the levels of NO (1.76-fold) and 
MDA (1.51-fold) as compared with diabetic rats. The expression of IL-6 
(5.13-fold), IL-1α (2.35-fold), TNF-α (2.35-fold) and TGF-β (2.39-fold) was 
increased in diabetic rats from control. IL-6 (2.43-fold), IL-1α (2.27-fold), 
TNF-α (1.68-fold) and TGF-β (2.3-fold) were decreased in the Rb1 treatment 
group. Diabetes increased the apoptosis rate (2.23-fold vs. control), and Rb1 
treatment decreased the apoptosis rate (1.73-fold vs. the diabetic rats). Rb1 
and insulin ameliorated lung tissue injury.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that Rb1 could be useful for 
mitigating oxidative damage and inflammatory infiltration in the diabetic lung.

Ultrasensitive Fibroblast Activation Protein-α-Activated Fluorogenic Probe 
Enables Selective Imaging and Killing of Melanoma In Vivo.

Liu SY(1), Wang H(2), Nie G(3).

Melanoma is a malignant cancer with a high risk of metastasis and continued 
increase in death rates over the past decades, and its prognosis is highly 
related to the disease's stage, while early detection and treatment of melanoma 
are significant to the improvement of its therapy outcome. Different from the 
traditional methods for disease diagnosis, enzyme-activated fluorescent probes 
were developed rapidly due to their high sensitivity and temporal-spatial ratio 
and have been widely applied in tumor detection, surgical navigation, and 
cancer-related research. Fibroblast activation protein-α (FAPα), a serine-type 
cell surface protease that plays important roles in cell invasion and 
extracellular matrix degradation, is widely involved in tumor progression such 
as malignant melanoma, so developing a FAPα activity-based molecular tool would 
be of great potential for the early diagnosis and therapy of melanoma. However, 
few fluorescent probes targeting FAPα have been applied in melanoma-related 
studies, and thus, the construction of FAPα activity-based fluorescent probes 
for melanoma detection is in urgent need. By incorporating the selective 
recognition unit with a red-emission fluorophore, cresyl violet, we herein 
report an ultrasensitive (limit of detection = 5.3 ng/mL) fluorogenic probe for 
FAPα activity sensing, named CV-FAP; the acquired probe showed a significantly 
higher binding affinity (15.7-fold) and overall catalytic efficiency (2.6-fold) 
when compared with those of the best reported FAPα probes. The good performance 
of CV-FAP made it possible to discriminate malignant melanoma cells and 
tumor-bearing mice from normal cells and mice with high contrast. More 
importantly, CV-FAP showed significant antitumor activity toward melanoma in 
cultured cells and tumor-bearing nude mice (over 95% inhibited tumor growth) 
with good safety, which made it an ideal theranostic agent for melanoma.

LaGAT: link-aware graph attention network for drug-drug interaction prediction.

Hong Y(1), Luo P(1), Jin S(1)(2)(3), Liu X(1)(2).

MOTIVATION: Drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction is a challenging problem in 
pharmacology and clinical applications. With the increasing availability of 
large biomedical databases, large-scale biological knowledge graphs containing 
drug information have been widely used for DDI prediction. However, large 
knowledge graphs inevitably suffer from data noise problems, which limit the 
performance and interpretability of models based on the knowledge graph. Recent 
studies attempt to improve models by introducing inductive bias through an 
attention mechanism. However, they all only depend on the topology of entity 
nodes independently to generate fixed attention pathways, without considering 
the semantic diversity of entity nodes in different drug pair links. This makes 
it difficult for models to select more meaningful nodes to overcome data quality 
limitations and make more interpretable predictions.
RESULTS: To address this issue, we propose a Link-aware Graph Attention method 
for DDI prediction, called LaGAT, which is able to generate different attention 
pathways for drug entities based on different drug pair links. For a drug pair 
link, the LaGAT uses the embedding representation of one of the drugs as a query 
vector to calculate the attention weights, thereby selecting the appropriate 
topological neighbor nodes to obtain the semantic information of the other drug. 
We separately conduct experiments on binary and multi-class classification and 
visualize the attention pathways generated by the model. The results prove that 
LaGAT can better capture semantic relationships and achieves remarkably superior 
performance over both the classical and state-of-the-art models on DDI 
prediction.

The synergic impact of lignin and Lactobacillus plantarum on DSS-induced colitis 
model via regulating CD44 and miR 199a alliance.

Kaliyamoorthy V(1), Jacop JP(2), Thirugnanasambantham K(3)(4), Ibrahim 
HIM(3)(5), Kandhasamy S(6).

Chronic or recurrent immune system activation and inflammation inside the 
gastrointestinal tract is characterized by inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Due 
to the lack of safety and efficacy of traditional medications, the use of food 
supplements for IBD management is on the rise. Numerous studies reported that, 
certain food supplements have a variety of therapeutic benefits for IBD. In the 
present study, a mouse model of IBD was used to the anti-colitis effects of 
lignin supplementation with Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum) on intestinal 
inflammation. The animal model was treated with dextran sodium sulphate (DSS), 
the illness index increased, and colon length and body weight declined, but 
these effects were reversed when lignin and L. plantarum treated groups. In 
addition, lignin and L. plantarum supplementation inhibited the DSS induced 
increase in levels of cytokines TNF-α (250 pg/mL), INF-γ (180 pg/mL), IL-1β (70 
pg/mL) and TGF- β (72 pg/mL). Gene and protein expression study revealed that 
Lignin and L. plantarum supplementation restored the expression of E-cad and 
suppressed the expression of STAT3 in DSS induced colitis model. Lignin and L. 
plantarum supplementation also suppressed CD44 expression (1.2 fold) by up 
regulating the expression of miR199a (1 fold) over DSS induced colitis. Our 
study suggests that Lactobacillus, lignin, and their synergistic treatments have 
protective roles against inflammatory bowel disease through changes in 
inflammatory cytokines, and miR 199a expression in DSS-induced colitis.

PCN-Miner: an open-source extensible tool for the analysis of Protein Contact 
Networks.

Guzzi PH(1), Di Paola L(2), Giuliani A(3), Veltri P(1).

MOTIVATION: Protein Contact Network (PCN) is a powerful method for analysing the 
structure and function of proteins, with a specific focus on disclosing the 
molecular features of allosteric regulation through the discovery of modular 
substructures. The importance of PCN analysis has been shown in many contexts, 
such as the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and its complexes with the 
Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) human receptors. Even if there exist many 
software tools implementing such methods, there is a growing need for the 
introduction of tools integrating existing approaches.
RESULTS: We present PCN-Miner, a software tool implemented in the Python 
programming language, able to (i) import protein structures from the Protein 
Data Bank; (ii) generate the corresponding PCN; (iii) model, analyse and 
visualize PCNs and related protein structures by using a set of known algorithms 
and metrics. The PCN-Miner can cover a large set of applications: from 
clustering to embedding and subsequent analysis.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The PCN-Miner tool is freely available at the 
following GitHub repository: https://github.com/hguzzi/ProteinContactNetworks. 
It is also available in the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository.

Immunogenicity of a newly developed vaccine against Clostridium perfringens 
alpha-toxin in rabbits and cattle.

Saadh MJ(1), Lafi FF(1), Dahadha AA(2), Albannan MS(3).

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Clostridium perfringens type A is an anaerobic bacterium 
that produces four major toxins (alpha, beta, epsilon, and iota) that cause 
various diseases. Most of the important C. perfringens-associated diseases of 
farm animals are caused by alpha-toxin. This study aimed to produce a vaccine 
against alpha-toxin using C. perfringens type A (ATCC 13124) and investigate its 
potency, stability, and safety.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The vaccine was formulated of its constituents for 1 h. 
Each milliliter of the final vaccine product contained alpha toxoid 15 
lecithovitellinase activity (Lv) by adding (0.375 mL containing 40 Lv) and 
approximately 0.2 mL from 3% concentrated aluminum hydroxide gel, <0.001% W/V 
thiomersal, <0.05% W/V formaldehyde, and nearly 0.425 mL phosphate-buffered 
saline (pH 7.2). The vaccine efficacy was evaluated in rabbits and cattle by 
performing potency, stability, and safety tests.
RESULTS: The vaccine produced approximately 8.8 and 4.9 IU/mL neutralizing 
antibodies in rabbits and cattle, respectively. These concentrations were higher 
than the lowest concentration recommended by various international protocols and 
the United States Department of Agriculture by 2.20-fold in rabbits and 
1.23-fold in cattle. Interestingly, the formulated vaccine enhanced immune 
responses by 1.80-fold in rabbits compared with that in cattle; the difference 
was statistically significant (p < 0.0001). The vaccine was stable for 30 
months. In vaccinated rabbits, the body temperature slightly increased 
temporarily during the first 10 h of vaccination; however, the temperature 
difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: This study describes a manufacturing process to obtain sufficient 
amounts of a vaccine against C. perfringens alpha-toxin. The formulated vaccine 
effectively elicited a higher level of neutralizing antibody response than the 
international standards. Furthermore, the vaccine was found to be stable, safe, 
and effective in preventing C. perfringens-related diseases in rabbits and 
cattle. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the efficacy of this vaccine 
in other farm animals.

Selective α(3)β(4) Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Ligand as a Potential Tracer 
for Drug Addiction.

Kanasuwan A(1)(2), Deuther-Conrad W(3), Chongruchiroj S(4), Sarasamkan J(5), 
Chotipanich C(2), Vajragupta O(6), Arunrungvichian K(1).

α3β4 Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) has been recognized as an emerging 
biomarker for the early detection of drug addiction. Herein, α3β4 nAChR ligands 
were designed and synthesized to improve the binding affinity and selectivity of 
two lead compounds, (S)-QND8 and (S)-T2, for the development of an α3β4 nAChR 
tracer. The structural modification was achieved by retaining the key features 
and expanding the molecular structure with a benzyloxy group to increase the 
lipophilicity for blood-brain barrier penetration and to extend the 
ligand-receptor interaction. The preserved key features are a fluorine atom for 
radiotracer development and a p-hydroxyl motif for ligand-receptor binding 
affinity. Four (R)- and (S)-quinuclidine-triazole (AK1-AK4) were synthesized and 
the binding affinity, together with selectivity to α3β4 nAChR subtype, were 
determined by competitive radioligand binding assay using [3H]epibatidine as a 
radioligand. Among all modified compounds, AK3 showed the highest binding 
affinity and selectivity to α3β4 nAChR with a Ki value of 3.18 nM, comparable to 
(S)-QND8 and (S)-T2 and 3069-fold higher affinity to α3β4 nAChR in comparison to 
α7 nAChR. The α3β4 nAChR selectivity of AK3 was considerably higher than those 
of (S)-QND8 (11.8-fold) and (S)-T2 (294-fold). AK3 was shown to be a promising 
α3β4 nAChR tracer for further development as a radiotracer for drug addiction.

Design, Synthesis, In Silico and In Vitro Studies of New Immunomodulatory 
Anticancer Nicotinamide Derivatives Targeting VEGFR-2.

IMM(3), Alsfouk BA(4), Elkaeed EB(5), Metwaly AM(6)(7), Eissa IH(1).

VEGFR-2, the subtype receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) responsible for 
angiogenesis, is expressed in various cancer cells. Thus, VEGFER-2 inhibition is 
an efficient approach for the discovery of new anticancer agents. Accordingly, a 
new set of nicotinamide derivatives were designed and synthesized to be VEGFR-2 
inhibitors. The chemical structures were confirmed using IR, 1H-NMR, and 13C-NMR 
spectroscopy. The obtained compounds were examined for their anti-proliferative 
activities against the human cancer cell lines (HCT-116 and HepG2). VEGFR-2 
inhibitory activities were determined for the titled compounds. Compound 8 
exhibited the strongest anti-proliferative activities with IC50 values of 5.4 
and 7.1 µM against HCT-116 and HepG2, respectively. Interestingly, compound 8 
was the most potent VEGFR-2 inhibitor with an IC50 value of 77.02 nM (compare to 
sorafenib: IC50 = 53.65 nM). Treatment of HCT-116 cells with compound 8 produced 
arrest of the cell cycle at the G0-G1 phase and a total apoptosis increase from 
3.05 to 19.82%-6.5-fold in comparison to the negative control. In addition, 
compound 8 caused significant increases in the expression levels of caspase-8 
(9.4-fold) and Bax (9.2-fold), and a significant decrease in the Bcl-2 
expression level (3-fold). The effects of compound 8 on the levels of the 
immunomodulatory proteins (TNF-α and IL-6) were examined. There was a marked 
decrease in the level of TNF-α (92.37%) compared to the control (82.47%) and a 
non-significant reduction in the level of IL-6. In silico docking, molecular 
dynamics simulations, and MM-PBSA studies revealed the high affinity, the 
correct binding, and the optimum dynamics of compound 8 inside the active site 
of VEGFR-2. Finally, in silico ADMET and toxicity studies indicated acceptable 
values of drug-likeness. In conclusion, compound 8 has emerged as a promising 
anti-proliferative agent targeting VEGFR-2 with significant apoptotic and 
immunomodulatory effects.

Preparation and characterization of sugilite glass from basalt for α-amylase 
immobilization, statistical optimization of the immobilization process and 
description of free and immobilized enzyme.

Abdel-Hameed SAM(1), Ahmed SA(2), Mostafa FA(2), Almasarawi ON(1), Abdel Wahab 
WA(2).

Bacterial α-amylase was immobilized on sugilite from modified basalt rock as a 
new carrier. A set of glass compositions based on sugilite formula 
KNa2M2Li3Si12O30 (M = Al or Mn or Fe) were prepared. The glasses were prepared 
through melting-quenching technique and samples of glass were converted to glass 
ceramic. Among the tested glasses and glass ceramic only sugilite glass based on 
M = Fe (BSF) give promising results. The sugilite BSF glass was characterized 
using DSC analysis, FTIR absorption, and SEM. The sugilite glass revealed high 
thermal resistant till ∼770 °C. Under optimized conditions of the Central 
composite design, the immobilization yield improved by 4.7-fold. The affinity to 
starch increased after enzyme immobilization by 4.3-fold. The lower rate of 
deactivation constant and the increase of t ½ and D-value confirm the 
suitability of BSF and immobilization method in enhancing enzyme stability. The 
improvement in thermostability of immobilized α-amylase was judged by the change 
in thermodynamic parameters. In conclusion, the prepared sugilite BSF glass can 
be utilized as a new carrier suitable for stabilization of α-amylase enzyme by 
immobilization.

External validity of analogue sexual risk laboratory data.

Simons JS(1), Maisto SA(1), Palfai TP(2).

This article presents data on the external validity of an alcohol administration 
study of sexual decision-making in men who have sex with men (MSM) ages 21-50. 
Men (N = 135) randomized to alcohol (blood alcohol concentration [BAC] = .075%) 
or water control conditions reported intentions to engage in condomless anal 
intercourse (CAI) in response to video vignettes. Following the experiment 
participants provided 6 weeks of experience sampling method (ESM) data assessing 
intoxication, sexual arousal, partner relationship, and sexual behavior. 
Laboratory CAI intentions were hypothesized to predict future CAI behavior, and 
associations were hypothesized to be conditional upon sexual arousal and 
intoxication contextual factors as well as laboratory beverage condition. The 
hypotheses were partially supported. CAI intentions were correlated with subject 
proportions of days engaging in CAI (r = .29). A multilevel analysis indicated, 
on average, CAI intention predicted increased probability of CAI versus anal 
intercourse with a condom (relative risk ratio [RRR] = 1.43). There was mixed 
evidence of CAI intentions effects being conditional upon laboratory condition 
as well as arousal and intoxication contextual factors. Graphs of conditional 
marginal effects identified regions of significance. Effects of CAI intention 
for men in the alcohol condition on the CAI versus No Sex contrast were 
significant when sexual arousal was elevated. CAI intentions for men in the 
water control condition predicted a higher probability of CAI versus anal 
intercourse with a condom when intoxication was moderately elevated and/or 
arousal moderately low. The results support the external validity of alcohol 
administration experiments of sexual decision-making among MSM and, 
reciprocally, provide support for the validity of ESM assessment of sexual 
behavior. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved).

Estrogen Receptor Subtypes Elicit a Distinct Gene Expression Profile of 
Endothelial-Derived Factors Implicated in Atherosclerotic Plaque Vulnerability.

Nasiri-Ansari N(1), Spilioti E(1)(2), Kyrou I(3)(4)(5)(6), Kalotychou V(7), 
Chatzigeorgiou A(8), Sanoudou D(9)(10)(11), Dahlman-Wright K(12), Randeva 
HS(3)(4), Papavassiliou AG(1), Moutsatsou P(1), Kassi E(1)(13).

In the presence of established atherosclerosis, estrogens are potentially 
harmful. MMP-2 and MMP-9, their inhibitors (TIMP-2 and TIMP-1), RANK, RANKL, 
OPG, MCP-1, lysyl oxidase (LOX), PDGF-β, and ADAMTS-4 play critical roles in 
plaque instability/rupture. We aimed to investigate (i) the effect of estradiol 
on the expression of the abovementioned molecules in endothelial cells, (ii) 
which type(s) of estrogen receptors mediate these effects, and (iii) the role of 
p21 in the estrogen-mediated regulation of the aforementioned factors. Human 
aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) were cultured with estradiol in the presence or 
absence of TNF-α. The expression of the aforementioned molecules was assessed by 
qRT-PCR and ELISA. Zymography was also performed. The experiments were repeated 
in either ERα- or ERβ-transfected HAECs and after silencing p21. HAECs expressed 
only the GPR-30 estrogen receptor. Estradiol, at low concentrations, decreased 
MMP-2 activity by 15-fold, increased LOX expression by 2-fold via GPR-30, and 
reduced MCP-1 expression by 3.5-fold via ERβ. The overexpression of ERα 
increased MCP-1 mRNA expression by 2.5-fold. In a low-grade inflammation state, 
lower concentrations of estradiol induced the mRNA expression of MCP-1 
(3.4-fold) and MMP-9 (7.5-fold) and increased the activity of MMP-2 (1.7-fold) 
via GPR-30. Moreover, p21 silencing resulted in equivocal effects on the 
expression of the abovementioned molecules. Estradiol induced different effects 
regarding atherogenic plaque instability through different ERs. The balance of 
the expression of the various ER subtypes may play an important role in the 
paradoxical characterization of estrogens as both beneficial and harmful.

This study explores the potential of using cobalt ferrite (CF) nanoparticles 
grown in situ on eggshell membranes (ESM) to mitigate the increasing problem of 
electromagnetic interference (EMI). A simple carbonization process was adopted 
to synthesize CF nanoparticles on ESM. The study further examines the 
composites' surface morphology and chemical composition and evaluates their 
microwave absorption performance (MAP) at X-band frequency. Results showed that 
the composite of CF and ESM - CESM@CF, exhibited a strong RL peak value of 
-39.03 mm with an optimal thickness of 1.5 mm. The combination of CF and ESM 
demonstrates excellent impedance matching and EM wave attenuation. The presence 
of numerous interfaces, conduction loss from the morphology, interfacial 
polarisation, and dual influence from both CF and ESM contribute to the high MAP 
of the composite. CESM@CF composite is projected as an excellent biomass-based 
nano-composite for EM wave absorption applications.

MOTIVATION: This article presents libRoadRunner 2.0, an extensible, 
high-performance, cross-platform, open-source software library for the 
simulation and analysis of models expressed using the systems biology markup 
language (SBML).
RESULTS: libRoadRunner is a self-contained library, able to run either as a 
component inside other tools via its C++, C and Python APIs, or interactively 
through its Python or Julia interface. libRoadRunner uses a custom just-in-time 
(JIT) compiler built on the widely used LLVM JIT compiler framework. It compiles 
SBML-specified models directly into native machine code for a large variety of 
processors, making it fast enough to simulate extremely large models or repeated 
runs in reasonable timeframes. libRoadRunner is flexible, supporting the bulk of 
the SBML specification (except for delay and non-linear algebraic equations) as 
well as several SBML extensions such as hierarchical composition and probability 
distributions. It offers multiple deterministic and stochastic integrators, as 
well as tools for steady-state, sensitivity, stability and structural analyses.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: libRoadRunner binary distributions for Windows, 
Mac OS and Linux, Julia and Python bindings, source code and documentation are 
all available at https://github.com/sys-bio/roadrunner, and Python bindings are 
also available via pip. The source code can be compiled for the supported 
systems as well as in principle any system supported by LLVM-13, such as 
ARM-based computers like the Raspberry Pi. The library is licensed under the 
Apache License Version 2.0.

Establishment of Quality Evaluation Method for Yinqiao Powder: A Herbal Formula 
against COVID-19 in China.

Zhang H(1), Xu L(2), Song J(2), Zhang A(3), Zhang X(2), Li Q(2), Qu X(4), Wang 
P(1).

Yinqiao powder, with significant anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects, is a 
classical formula for the treatment of febrile diseases in China. During the 
SARS period in 2003, Yinqiao powder showed a good antipyretic effect. It also 
plays a major role in the treatment for COVID-19 in China. Although there are 
many studies on the chemical compositions and pharmacological effects of Yinqiao 
powder, there are few studies on the quality standard system of it. In our 
study, a systematic quality evaluation method of Yinqiao powder combining HPLC 
fingerprint with quantitative analysis of multi-components by single marker 
(QAMS) based on network pharmacology and UPLC-Q-Exactive-Orbitrap-MS was 
established for the first time. In the UPLC-Q-Exactive-Orbitrap-MS experiment, a 
total of 53 compounds were identified in the extract solution of Yinqiao powder. 
In addition, 33 blood components were characterized, 23 of which were 
prototypes. The results of network pharmacology analysis showed that Yinqiao 
powder may inhibit inflammatory responses by suppressing IL-6, CXCL2, TNFα, 
NF-κB, etc., in the treatment of COVID-19. The HPLC fingerprint analysis of 
Yinqiao powder was conducted at 237 nm and 29 characteristic peaks were matched, 
11 of which were identified. Forsythoside A was selected as the internal 
standard reference and double-wavelength (237 nm and 327 nm) was established in 
QAMS experiment. The repeatability was well under different conditions, and the 
results measured by QAMS were consisted with that of the external standard 
method (ESM), indicating that the QAMS method was reliable and accurate. The 
quality evaluation method of Yinqiao powder would be helpful to evaluate the 
intrinsic quality of Yinqiao powder more comprehensively, which is conducive to 
improve the quality standard of Yinqiao powder and provide a beneficial 
guarantee for the clinical treatment of COVID-19.

Total enzymatic synthesis of cis-α-irone from a simple carbon source.

Chen X(1), T R(2), Esque J(3), Zhang C(2), Shukal S(2), Lim CC(2), Ong L(2), 
Smith D(2), André I(4).

Metabolic engineering has become an attractive method for the efficient 
production of natural products. However, one important pre-requisite is to 
establish the biosynthetic pathways. Many commercially interesting molecules 
cannot be biosynthesized as their native biochemical pathways are not fully 
elucidated. Cis-α-irone, a top-end perfumery molecule, is an example. 
Retrobiosynthetic pathway design by employing promiscuous enzymes provides an 
alternative solution to this challenge. In this work, we design a synthetic 
pathway to produce cis-α-irone with a promiscuous methyltransferase (pMT). Using 
structure-guided enzyme engineering strategies, we improve pMT activity and 
specificity towards cis-α-irone by >10,000-fold and >1000-fold, respectively. By 
incorporating the optimized methyltransferase into our engineered microbial 
cells, ~86 mg l-1 cis-α-irone is produced from glucose in a 5 l bioreactor. Our 
work illustrates that integrated retrobiosynthetic pathway design and enzyme 
engineering can offer opportunities to expand the scope of natural molecules 
that can be biosynthesized.

Molecular Drivers of Multiple and Elevated Resistance to Insecticides in a 
Population of the Malaria Vector Anopheles gambiae in Agriculture Hotspot of 
West Cameroon.

Tepa A(1)(2), Kengne-Ouafo JA(1), Djova VS(1)(3), Tchouakui M(1), Mugenzi 
LMJ(1), Djouaka R(4), Pieme CA(2), Wondji CS(1)(5)(6).

(1) Background: Malaria remains a global public health problem. Unfortunately, 
the resistance of malaria vectors to commonly used insecticides threatens 
disease control and elimination efforts. Field mosquitoes have been shown to 
survive upon exposure to high insecticide concentrations. The molecular 
mechanisms driving this pronounced resistance remain poorly understood. Here, we 
elucidated the pattern of resistance escalation in the main malaria vector 
Anopheles gambiae in a pesticide-driven agricultural hotspot in Cameroon and its 
impact on vector control tools; (2) Methods: Larval stages and indoor blood-fed 
female mosquitoes (F0) were collected in Mangoum in May and November and forced 
to lay eggs; the emerged mosquitoes were used for WHO tube, synergist and cone 
tests. Molecular identification was performed using SINE PCR, whereas 
TaqMan-based PCR was used for genotyping of L1014F/S and N1575Y kdr and the 
G119S-ACE1 resistance markers. The transcription profile of candidate resistance 
genes was performed using qRT-PCR methods. Characterization of the breeding 
water and soil from Mangoum was achieved using the HPLC technique; (3) Results: 
An. gambiae s.s. was the only species in Mangoum with 4.10% infection with 
Plasmodium. These mosquitoes were resistant to all the four classes of 
insecticides with mortality rates <7% for pyrethroids and DDT and <54% for 
carbamates and organophophates. This population also exhibited high resistance 
intensity to pyrethroids (permethrin, alpha-cypermethrin and deltamethrin) after 
exposure to 5× and 10× discriminating doses. Synergist assays with PBO revealed 
only a partial recovery of susceptibility to permethrin, alpha-cypermethrin and 
deltamethrin. Only PBO-based nets (Olyset plus and permaNet 3.0) and Royal Guard 
showed an optimal efficacy. A high amount of alpha-cypermethrin was detected in 
breeding sites (5.16-fold LOD) suggesting ongoing selection from agricultural 
pesticides. The 1014F-kdr allele was fixed (100%) whereas the 1575Y-kdr (37.5%) 
and the 119S Ace-1R (51.1%) were moderately present. Elevated expression of 
P450s, respectively, in permethrin and deltamethrin resistant mosquitoes [CYP6M2 
(10 and 34-fold), CYP6Z1(17 and 29-fold), CYP6Z2 (13 and 65-fold), CYP9K1 (13 
and 87-fold)] supports their role in the observed resistance besides other 
mechanisms including chemosensory genes as SAP1 (28 and 13-fold), SAP2 (5 and 
5-fold), SAP3 (24 and 8-fold) and cuticular genes as CYP4G16 (6 and 8-fold) and 
CYP4G17 (5 and 27-fold). However, these candidate genes were not associated with 
resistance escalation as the expression levels did not differ significantly 
between 1×, 5× and 10× surviving mosquitoes; (4) Conclusions: Intensive and 
multiple resistance is being selected in malaria vectors from a pesticide-based 
agricultural hotspot of Cameroon leading to loss in the efficacy of 
pyrethroid-only nets. Further studies are needed to decipher the molecular basis 
underlying such resistance escalation to better assess its impact on control 
interventions.

An α-β-Divergence-Generalized Recommender for Highly Accurate Predictions of 
Missing User Preferences.

Shang M, Yuan Y, Luo X, Zhou M.

To quantify user-item preferences, a recommender system (RS) commonly adopts a 
high-dimensional and sparse (HiDS) matrix. Such a matrix can be represented by a 
non-negative latent factor analysis model relying on a single latent factor 
(LF)-dependent, non-negative, and multiplicative update algorithm. However, 
existing models' representative abilities are limited due to their specialized 
learning objective. To address this issue, this study proposes an α- β 
-divergence-generalized model that enjoys fast convergence. Its ideas are 
three-fold: 1) generalizing its learning objective with α- β -divergence to 
achieve highly accurate representation of HiDS data; 2) incorporating a 
generalized momentum method into parameter learning for fast convergence; and 3) 
implementing self-adaptation of controllable hyperparameters for excellent 
practicability. Empirical studies on six HiDS matrices from real RSs demonstrate 
that compared with state-of-the-art LF models, the proposed one achieves 
significant accuracy and efficiency gain to estimate huge missing data in an 
HiDS matrix.

Visual Detection and Sensing of Mercury Ions and Glutathione Using Fluorescent 
Copper Nanoclusters.

Zhang C(1), Liang M(1), Shao C(1), Li Z(1), Cao X(1), Wang Y(1), Wu Y(2), Lu 
S(3)(4).

Visual detection of mercury ions and glutathione is of great significance to 
public health and environmental issues. Herein, we developed a fluorescent 
sensor (l-Cys/CuNCs@ESM) based on the eggshell membrane (ESM) and red-emitting 
copper nanoclusters (CuNCs) by the in situ strategy via l-cysteine (l-Cys) as 
the reducing and protective agent for mercury ions and glutathione sensing 
visually. The as-prepared fluorescent product had good stability, portability, 
large Stokes shift (250 nm), and long fluorescence lifetime (7.3 μs). Notably, 
the l-Cys/CuNCs@ESM exhibited a specific fluorescence quenching response toward 
Hg2+. Moreover, the interaction between glutathione (GSH) and Hg2+ could 
subsequently recover the fluorescence effectively. Inspired by this "on-off-on" 
switch, the l-Cys/CuNCs@ESM was applied as the dual-sensing system for visual 
detection of mercury ions and glutathione integrating with the portable 
smartphone. The limit of detection (LOD) of Hg2+ is 1.1 μM for visualization and 
0.52 μM for the fluorescence spectrometer. The corresponding LODs of GSH are 2.8 
and 0.59 μM, respectively. This platform presents significant sensitivity, 
specificity, and stability, offering a promising potential for real-time/on-site 
sensing.

Encapsulation of berberine decorated ZnO nano-colloids into injectable hydrogel 
using for diabetic wound healing.

Yin X(1), Fan X(2), Zhou Z(3), Li Q(4).

Chronic wound healing in diabetic patients had been considered a major clinical 
challenge, so there was an urgent need to establish more effective treatment 
methods. In this study, we prepared berberine-modified ZnO nano-colloids 
hydrogel (ZnO-Ber/H) and evaluated its wound healing performance in a diabetic 
rat. The prepared ZnO-Ber/H had excellent moisturizing, anti-inflammatory and 
anti-oxidative stress abilities. In vitro, ZnO-Ber/H could effectively 
up-regulate antioxidant stress factors (Nrf2, HO-1, NQO1) by 4.65-fold, 
2.49-fold, 2.56-fold, respectively. In vivo experiments have shown that 
ZnO-Ber/H could effectively improve the wound healing rate (92.9%) after 15 days 
of treatment. Meanwhile, the ability of anti-oxidative stress had also been 
verified in vivo. ZnO-Ber/H down-regulated inflammatory factor (TNF-α, IL-1β, 
and IL-6) by 72.8%, 55% and 71% respectively, up-regulated vascular related 
factors VEGF and CD31 by 3.9-fold and 3.2-fold by Western blot. At the same 
time, ZnO-Ber/H could promote the expression of EGFR and FGFR, thereby affecting 
the generation of new epithelial tissue. Based on extensive characterization and 
biological evaluation, ZnO-Ber/H was expected to be a potential candidate for 
promoting diabetic wound healing.

Exploring the digital footprint of depression: a PRISMA systematic literature 
review of the empirical evidence.

Zarate D(1), Stavropoulos V(2)(3), Ball M(2), de Sena Collier G(2), Jacobson 
NC(4)(5)(6)(7).

Erratum in
    BMC Psychiatry. 2022 Aug 5;22(1):530.

BACKGROUND: This PRISMA systematic literature review examined the use of digital 
data collection methods (including ecological momentary assessment [EMA], 
experience sampling method [ESM], digital biomarkers, passive sensing, mobile 
sensing, ambulatory assessment, and time-series analysis), emphasizing on 
digital phenotyping (DP) to study depression. DP is defined as the use of 
digital data to profile health information objectively.
AIMS: Four distinct yet interrelated goals underpin this study: (a) to identify 
empirical research examining the use of DP to study depression; (b) to describe 
the different methods and technology employed; (c) to integrate the evidence 
regarding the efficacy of digital data in the examination, diagnosis, and 
monitoring of depression and (d) to clarify DP definitions and digital mental 
health records terminology.
RESULTS: Overall, 118 studies were assessed as eligible. Considering the terms 
employed, "EMA", "ESM", and "DP" were the most predominant. A variety of DP data 
sources were reported, including voice, language, keyboard typing kinematics, 
mobile phone calls and texts, geocoded activity, actigraphy sensor-related 
recordings (i.e., steps, sleep, circadian rhythm), and self-reported apps' 
information. Reviewed studies employed subjectively and objectively recorded 
digital data in combination with interviews and psychometric scales.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest links between a person's digital records and 
depression. Future research recommendations include (a) deriving consensus 
regarding the DP definition and (b) expanding the literature to consider a 
person's broader contextual and developmental circumstances in relation to their 
digital data/records.

Non-anaesthetist-administered ketamine for emergency caesarean section in Kenya: 
cost-effectiveness analysis.

Resch SC(1), Suarez S(2)(3), Omotayo MO(2)(4), Griffin J(5), Sessler D(6), Burke 
T(2)(4)(7).

OBJECTIVES: Lack of anaesthesia services is a frequent barrier to emergency 
surgeries such as caesarean delivery in Kenya. This study aimed to estimate the 
survival gains and cost-effectiveness of scaling up the Every Second Matters 
(ESM)-Ketamine programme that trains non-anaesthetist providers to administer 
and monitor ketamine during emergency caesarean deliveries.
SETTING: Hospitals in Kenyan counties with low rates of caesarean delivery.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients needing emergency caesarean delivery in settings without 
availability of standard anaesthesia service.
INTERVENTIONS: Simulated scales up of the ESM-Ketamine programme over 5 years 
(2020-24) was compared with status quo.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost of implementing the programme and corresponding 
additional emergency caesarean deliveries. Maternal and fetal/neonatal deaths 
prevented, and corresponding life-years gained due to increased provision of 
emergency caesarean procedures. Cost-effectiveness was assessed by comparing the 
cost per life-year gained of the ESM-Ketamine programme compared with status 
quo.
RESULTS: Over 5 years, the expected gap in emergency caesarean deliveries was 
157 000. A US$1.2 million ESM-Ketamine programme reduced this gap by 28 700, 
averting by 316 maternal and 4736 fetal deaths and generating 331 000 total 
life-years gained. Cost-effectiveness of scaling up the ESM-Ketamine programme 
was US$44 per life-year gained in the base case and US$251 in the most 
pessimistic scenario-a very good value for Kenya at less than 20% of per capita 
GDP per life-year gained.
CONCLUSION: In areas of Kenya with significant underprovision of emergency 
caesarean delivery due to a lack of availability of traditional anaesthesia, an 
ESM-Ketamine programme is likely to enable a substantial number of life-saving 
surgeries at reasonable cost.

Positive growth of smooth muscle in uterine horns of myostatin homozygous mutant 
gilt.

Liu XY(1), Choe HM(1), Li ZY(1), Jin ZY(1), Chang SY(1), Kang JD(1), Yin XJ(2), 
Quan BH(3).

Current studies on myostatin (MSTN), a well-known negative regulator of skeletal 
muscle, studies mainly focus on the its effects on skeletal muscle.However, its 
effects on smooth muscle are less studied, especially in the uterine horns. To 
identify the role of MSTN in uterine horn smooth muscle, this study used 
6-8-month-old homozygous MSTN mutant (MSTN-/-) gilts in anoestrum as animal 
models. Histochemical and immunofluorescence staining, western blotting, and 
RT-qPCR were performed. The results showed that the uteri of the MSTN-/- gilts 
were morphologically normal, and the uterine horn smooth muscle content was 
increased (MSTN-/-: 75.19%, Wild type: 51.52%, P < 0.01). In vivo 
immunofluorescence staining showed that the expression of the uterine horn 
smooth muscle-specific marker proteins, namely α-smooth muscle actin (ACTA2) and 
calponin, increased after MSTN knockout (1.41- and 1.21-fold, respectively, 
P < 0.05). Increased gene expression was also seen in MSTN-/- gilts in vivo for 
ACTA2 (approximately 2-fold), smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (7.14-fold), 
myocardin (9.32-fold), and serum response factor (2.17-fold). Protein expression 
of smooth muscle-specific markers was increased (1.51-fold for ACTA2, 1.57-fold 
for calponin, P<0.05). MSTN knockout promoted proliferation of the smooth muscle 
cell and the gene expression of c-kit, a peristaltic marker (2.43-fold, 
P < 0.05). The results of the in vitro experiments were consistent with those of 
the in vivo experiments. The present study indicates that MSTN knockout can 
increase the smooth muscle content of uterine horns, thus providing potential 
therapeutic targets for pregnancy disorders caused by increased smooth muscle 
content.

Paraben exposures and their interactions with ESR1/2 genetic polymorphisms on 
hypertension.

Zhou S(1), Lu H(1), Zhang X(1), Shi X(1), Jiang S(1), Wang L(1), Lu Q(2).

The widely used paraben preservatives have been frequently detected in human 
urine, and shown to disrupt the endocrine system. Recently, several 
epidemiologic studies have investigated the associations between paraben 
exposures and hypertension risk, but findings are inconsistent. Genetic 
susceptibility variation may contribute to the conflicting results. This study 
aimed to explore the associations of paraben exposures and their interactions 
with estrogen receptor genes 1 and 2 (ESR1 and ESR2) polymorphisms with 
hypertension. We conducted a hospital-based case-control study involving 396 
hypertension cases and 396 controls in Wuhan, China. The urinary paraben 
concentrations were determined using a liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of 
flight mass spectrometer. The genotyping of ESR1 and ESR2 was performed using 
the Applied Biosystems 3730 XL sequencer. Multivariable logistic regression 
models were applied to examine the associations between urinary paraben 
concentrations and hypertension risk. Gene-environment interactions were 
estimated on both multiplicative and additive scales. The results showed that 
urinary ethylparaben (EtP), propylparaben (PrP), and ∑parabens (∑PBs) levels 
were positively associated with the risk of hypertension (Ptrend<0.05). Compared 
with their reference groups, subjects in the highest tertile of EtP, PrP, and 
∑PBs had a 4.05-fold (95% CI: 2.56, 6.41), 2.72-fold (95% CI: 1.76, 4.20), and 
1.60-fold (95% CI: 1.08, 2.36) increased risk of hypertension, respectively. 
When stratified by sex, the hypertensive effect of EtP was more pronounced in 
males (Pinteraction = 0.012). Furthermore, interaction analysis showed that PrP 
exposure interacted with ESR1 rs2234693 polymorphism on hypertension risk, with 
the significance of multiplicative (Pinteraction = 0.043) and additive 
(RERI = 1.27, AP = 0.52). Our results suggested that paraben exposure was 
positively related to hypertension risk, and that ESR1 rs2234693 polymorphism 
might modify the parabens exposure-related hypertensive effect.

Association between Endothelial Cell-Specific Molecule 1 and Galectin-3 in 
Patients with ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction: A Pilot Study.

Zhu K(2)(3).

The biomarkers galectin-3 (Gal-3) and endothelial cell-specific molecule 1 
(ESM-1) reflect endothelial function and inflammation. As a consequence, they 
play an important role in both the diagnosis and characterization of ST-segment 
elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). However, no prior study has explored 
the association between ESM-1 and Gal-3 in STEMI patients. This study is aimed 
at determining the ESM-1 and Gal-3 levels in the serum of STEMI patients and 
then exploring the correlation between the levels of these two biomarkers and 
their clinical significance in STEMI patients. The participants were divided 
into two groups: the ST group comprised 35 hospitalized STEMI patients while the 
control group comprised 24 people with normal coronary arteries. In all the 
patients, venous blood was taken from the middle of the antecubital fossa. The 
serum ESM-1 and Gal-3 concentrations were determined using an enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay. The results revealed that the ESM-1 and Gal-3 levels in the 
STEMI patients were 1.6 and 2.8 times higher, respectively, when compared with 
the controls (P < 0.001). Moreover, the ESM-1 and Gal-3 levels exhibited a 
positive linear correlation (r = 0.758, P < 0.001) in the acute STEMI patients. 
In conclusion, the ESM-1 and Gal-3 levels were found to be significantly 
elevated and correlated in the STEMI patients. Thus, combining these two 
biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction and inflammation might be useful for the 
diagnosis and assessment of STEMI.

Changes in the hydro-climatic regime of the Hunza Basin in the Upper Indus under 
CMIP6 climate change projections.

Nazeer A(1)(2)(3), Maskey S(4), Skaugen T(5), McClain ME(4)(6).

The Upper Indus Basin (UIB) heavily depends on its frozen water resources, and 
an accelerated melt due to the projected climate change may significantly alter 
future water availability. The future hydro-climatic regime and water 
availability of the Hunza basin (a sub-basin of UIB) were analysed using the 
newly released Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) climate 
projections. A data and parameter parsimonious precipitation-runoff model, the 
Distance Distribution Dynamics (DDD) model, was used with energy balance-based 
subroutines for snowmelt, glacier melt and evapotranspiration. The DDD model was 
set up for baseline (1991-2010), mid-century (2041-2060) and end-century 
(2081-2100) climates projections from two global circulation models (GCM), 
namely EC-Earth3 and MPI-ESM. The projections indicate a substantial increase in 
temperature (1.1-8.6 °C) and precipitation (12-32%) throughout the twenty-first 
century. The simulations show the future flow increase between 23-126% and the 
future glacier melt increase between 30-265%, depending on the scenarios and 
GCMs used. Moreover, the simulations suggest an increasing glacier melt 
contribution from all elevations with a significant increase from the higher 
elevations. The findings provide a basis for planning and modifying reservoir 
operation strategies with respect to hydropower generation, irrigation 
withdrawals, flood control, and drought management.

Paclitaxel induces cognitive impairment via necroptosis, decreased synaptic 
plasticity and M1 polarisation of microglia.

Tang M(1), Zhao S(1), Liu JX(1), Liu X(1), Guo YX(2), Wang GY(2), Wang XL(1).

CONTEXT: Paclitaxel (PTX) leads to chemotherapy brain (chemo-brain) which is 
characterised by cognitive impairment. It has been reported that necroptosis is 
associated with cognitive impairment in some neurodegenerative diseases, but it 
is not clear whether it is related to the development of chemo-brain.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of necroptosis and related changes in 
PTX-induced cognitive impairment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: C57bl/6n mice were randomly divided into five groups: 
control, vehicle, and different concentrations of PTX (6, 8, 10 mg/kg). Two 
additional groups received pre-treatment with Gdcl3 or PBS through 
Intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection before PTX-treatment. Cognitive 
function, necroptosis, synaptic plasticity and microglia polarisation were 
analysed.
RESULTS: PTX (10 mg/kg) induced significant cognitive impairment, accompanied by 
changes in synaptic plasticity, including decreased density of PSD95 
(0.65-fold), BDNF (0.44-fold) and dendritic spines (0.57-fold). PTX induced 
necroptosis of 53.41% (RIP3) and 61.91% (MLKL) in hippocampal neurons, with high 
expression of RIP3 (1.58-fold) compared with the control group. MLKL (1.87-fold) 
exhibited the same trend, reaching a peak on the 14th day. The increased 
expression of iNOS (1.63-fold) and inflammatory factors such as TNF-α 
(1.85-fold) and IL-β (1.89-fold) compared to the control group suggests that M1 
polarisation of microglia is involved in the process of cognitive impairment. 
Pre-treatment with Gdcl3 effectively reduced the number of microglia 
(0.50-fold), inhibited the release of TNF-α (0.73-fold) and IL-β (0.56-fold), 
and improved cognitive impairment.
CONCLUSION: We established a stable animal model of PTX-induced cognitive 
impairment and explored the underlying pathophysiological mechanism. These 
findings can guide the future treatment of chemo-brain.

Comparing electrical stimulation functional mapping with subdural electrodes and 
stereoelectroencephalography.

Aungaroon G(1)(2), Vedala K(1), Byars AW(1)(2), Ervin B(1)(3), Rozhkov L(1), 
Horn PS(1)(2), Ihnen SKZ(1)(2), Holland KD(1)(2), Tenney JR(1)(2), Kremer 
K(1)(2), Fong SL(1)(2), Lin N(1)(2), Liu W(1)(2), Arthur TM(1)(2), Fujiwara 
H(1)(2), Skoch J(2)(4), Leach JL(2)(5), Mangano FT(2)(4), Greiner HM(1)(2), Arya 
R(1)(2)(3).

OBJECTIVE: Electrical stimulation mapping (ESM) is the clinical standard for 
functional localization with subdural electrodes (SDE). As 
stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) has emerged as an alternative option, we 
compared functional responses, afterdischarges (ADs), and unwanted ESM-induced 
seizures (EISs) between the two electrode types.
METHODS: Incidence and current thresholds for functional responses (sensory, 
motor, speech/language), ADs, and EISs were compared between SDE and SEEG using 
mixed models incorporating relevant covariates.
RESULTS: We identified 67 SEEG ESM and 106 SDE ESM patients (7207 and 4980 
stimulated contacts, respectively). We found similar incidence of language and 
motor responses between electrode types; however, more SEEG patients reported 
sensory responses. ADs and EISs occurred less commonly with SEEG than SDE. 
Current thresholds for language, face motor, and upper extremity (UE) motor 
responses and EIS significantly decreased with age. However, they were not 
affected by electrode type, premedication, or dominant hemispheric stimulation. 
AD thresholds were higher with SEEG than with SDE. For SEEG ESM, language 
thresholds remained below AD thresholds up to 26 years of age, whereas this 
relationship was inverse for SDE. Also, face and UE motor thresholds fell below 
AD thresholds at earlier ages for SEEG than SDE. AD and EIS thresholds were not 
affected by premedication.
SIGNIFICANCE: SEEG and SDE have clinically relevant differences for functional 
brain mapping with electrical stimulation. Although evaluation of language and 
motor regions is comparable between SEEG and SDE, SEEG offers a higher 
likelihood of identifying sensory areas. A lower incidence of ADs and EISs, and 
a favorable relationship between functional and AD thresholds suggest superior 
safety and neurophysiologic validity for SEEG ESM than SDE ESM.

Chronic nitrate administration increases the expression the genes involved in 
the browning of white adipose tissue in female rats.

Yousefzadeh N(1), Jeddi S(1), Afzali H(1), Kashfi K(2), Ghasemi A(1).

Nitrate, a nitric oxide (NO) donor, has antiobesity effect in female rats. This 
study hypothesized that the antiobesity effect of nitrate in female rats is due 
to the browning of white adipose tissue (WAT). Female Wistar rats (aged 8 
months) were divided into two groups (n = 10/group): the control group received 
tap water and the nitrate group received water containing 100 mg/L of sodium 
nitrate for 9 months. At months 0, 3, 6, and 9, obesity indices were measured. 
At month 9, gonadal adipose tissue was used to measure messenger RNA (mRNA) and 
protein levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), PPAR-γ 
coactivator 1-α (PGC1-α), uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), and adipocyte density and 
area. After the 9-month intervention, nitrate-treated rats had lower body 
weight, body mass index, thoracic circumference, and abdominal circumference by 
6.4% (p = .012), 9.1% (p = .029), 6.0% (p = .056), and 5.7% (p = .098), 
respectively. In addition, nitrate-treated rats had higher PPAR-γ (mRNA: 
1.78-fold, p = .016 and protein: 19%, p = .076), PGC1-α (mRNA: 1.69-fold, 
p = .012 and protein: 68%, p = .001), and UCP1 (mRNA: 2.50-fold, p = .001 and 
protein: 81%, p = .001) in gonadal adipose tissue. Nitrate also reduced 
adipocyte area by 35% (p = .054) and increased adipocyte density by 31% 
(p = .086). In conclusion, antiobesity effect of nitrate in female rats is 
associated with increased browning of gonadal adipose tissue as indicated by 
higher expression of PPAR-γ, PGC1-α, and UCP1 and reduced adipocyte area and 
increased adipocyte density.

Unraveling the mechanism of raffinose utilization in Ligilactobacillus 
salivarius Ren by transcriptomic analysis.

Wang W(#)(1), Sudun(#)(2), Hu H(1), An J(1), Zhang H(3), Zhao Z(4), Hao Y(1)(5), 
Zhai Z(1)(5)(6).

In the gastrointestinal tract, some dietary carbohydrates, such as xylose, 
raffinose and arabinose, are able to stimulate the growth of Lactobacillus and 
Bifidobacterium. In this study, the growth rate of Ligilactobacillus salivarius 
Ren in raffinose was 0.91 ± 0.03 h-1, which was higher than that in glucose 
(0.83 ± 0.01 h-1). However, limited information is available on specific 
transporters and glycoside hydrolases responsible for raffinose uptake and 
catabolism in L. salivarius. Transcriptomic analysis revealed the differential 
expression of 236 genes (∣log2FoldChange∣ > 0.8) in response to raffinose, which 
were mainly associated with raffinose transport, raffinose hydrolysis, galactose 
metabolism and pyruvate metabolism. Notably, gene rafP encoding 
lactose/raffinose permease was 101.86-fold up-regulated. Two α-galactosidase 
gene galA1 and galA2 were 117.82-fold and 2.66-fold up-regulated, respectively. 
To further investigate the role of these genes in raffinose utilization, 
insertional inactivation was performed using the pORI28-pTRK669 system. The 
growth assay of these mutants in modified MRS containing 2% (w/v) raffinose 
indicated that RafP played an important role in raffinose transport and GalA1 
was the primary enzyme involved in raffinose hydrolysis. To our knowledge, this 
is the first report on the molecular mechanism of raffinose utilization in L. 
salivarius.

In Silico Positional Analogue Scanning with Amber GPU-TI.

Hu Y(1), Muegge I(1).

Positional analogue scanning (PAS) is an accepted strategy for multiparameter 
lead optimization (MPO) in drug discovery. Small structural changes as 
introduced by PAS can lead to 10-fold changes in binding potency in ∼10-20% of 
cases, a significant parameter shift irrespective of other MPO objectives. 
Sometimes performing a complete PAS is challenging due to resource and time 
constraints, building block availability, or difficulty in synthesis. 
Calculating relative binding free energies (RBFEs) for all positions can 
contribute to prioritizing the most promising analogues for synthesis. We tested 
a well-established RBFE calculation method, Amber GPU-TI, for 20 positional 
analogue scans in 14 test systems (cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8), hepatitis C 
virus nonstructural protein 5B (HCV NS5B), tankyrase, RAC-α 
serine/threonine-protein kinase (Akt), phosphodiesterase 1B (PDE1B), 
orexin/hypocretin receptor type 1 (OX1R), orexin/hypocretin receptor type 2 
(OX2R), histone acetyltransferase K (lysine) acetyltransferase 6A (KAT6A), 
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), extracellular 
signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), coactivator-associated arginine 
methyltransferase 1 (PRMT4), αvβ6, bromodomain 1 (BD1), human immunodeficiency 
virus-1 (HIV-1) entry) involving nitrogen, methyl, halogen, methoxy, and 
hydroxyl scans with at least four analogues per set. Among the 66 analogue 
positions explored, we found that in 18 cases Amber GPU-TI calculations 
predicted a more than 10-fold change in potency. In all of these cases, the 
experimentally observed direction of potency changes agreed with the 
predictions. In 16 cases, more than 10-fold changes in experimental potency were 
observed. Again, in all of these cases, Amber GPU-TI predicted the direction of 
the potency changes correctly. In none of these cases would a decision made for 
or against synthesis based on a 10-fold change in potency have resulted in 
missing an important analogue. Therefore, in silico RBFE calculations using 
Amber GPU-TI can meaningfully contribute to the prioritization of positional 
analogues before synthesis.

Neuropsychological Outcomes after Epilepsy Surgery: A Comparison of Stereo-EEG 
and Subdural Electrodes.

Arya R(1)(2)(3), Frink C(1), Kargol C(1), Byars AW(1)(2), Huddleston D(1), 
Diedenhofer DB(1), Aungaroon G(1)(2), Ervin B(1)(3), Horn PS(1)(2), Ihnen 
SKZ(1)(2), Tenney JR(1)(2), Kremer K(1)(2), Fong S(1)(2), Lin N(1)(2), Liu 
W(1)(2), Arthur TM(1)(2), Skoch J(2)(4), Leach JL(2)(5), Mangano FT(2)(4), 
Glauser TA(1)(2), Greiner HM(1)(2), Holland KD(1)(2).

OBJECTIVES: We analyzed the association of neuropsychological outcomes after 
epilepsy surgery with the intracranial electrode type (stereo-EEG [SEEG] and 
subdural electrodes [SDE]) and electrical stimulation mapping (ESM) of 
speech/language.
METHODS: Drug-resistant epilepsy patients who underwent comprehensive 
neurpsychological evaluation before and 1-year after epilepsy surgery were 
included. SEEG and SDE subgroups were matched by age, handedness, operated 
hemisphere, and seizure freedom. Postsurgical neuropsychological outcomes 
(adjusted for presurgical scores) and reliable change indices were analyzed as 
functions of electrode type and ESM.
RESULTS: Ninety nine patients aged 6-29 years were included with similar 
surgical resection/ablation volumes in SEEG and SDE subgroups. Most of the 
neuropsychological outcomes were comparable between SEEG and SDE subgroups, 
however, working memory and processing speed were significantly improved in the 
SEEG subgroup. Undergoing language ESM was associated with significant 
improvements in spelling, letter-word identification, vocabulary, verbal 
comprehension, verbal learning, and story memory scores, but a decline in 
calculation scores.
DISCUSSION: Intracranial evaluations with SEEG and SDE are comparable in terms 
of long-term postsurgical neuropsychological outcomes. Our data suggests that 
SEEG may be associated with improvements in working memory and processing speed, 
representing cognitive domains served by spatially distributed networks. Our 
study also supports wider use of language ESM before epilepsy surgery, 
preferably using other language tasks in addition to visual naming. Rather than 
the type of electrode, postsurgical neuropsychological outcomes are driven by 
whether language ESM was performed or not, with beneficial effects of language 
mapping.

Evaluating Covariate Effects on ESM Measurement Model Changes with Latent Markov 
Factor Analysis: A Three-Step Approach.

Vogelsmeier LVDE(1), Vermunt JK(1), Bülow A(1)(2), De Roover K(1).

Invariance of the measurement model (MM) between subjects and within subjects 
over time is a prerequisite for drawing valid inferences when studying dynamics 
of psychological factors in intensive longitudinal data. To conveniently 
evaluate this invariance, latent Markov factor analysis (LMFA) was proposed. 
LMFA combines a latent Markov model with mixture factor analysis: The Markov 
model captures changes in MMs over time by clustering subjects' observations 
into a few states and state-specific factor analyses reveal what the MMs look 
like. However, to estimate the model, Vogelsmeier, Vermunt, van Roekel, and De 
Roover (2019) introduced a one-step (full information maximum likelihood; FIML) 
approach that is counterintuitive for applied researchers and entails cumbersome 
model selection procedures in the presence of many covariates. In this paper, we 
simplify the complex LMFA estimation and facilitate the exploration of covariate 
effects on state memberships by splitting the estimation in three intuitive 
steps: (1) obtain states with mixture factor analysis while treating repeated 
measures as independent, (2) assign observations to the states, and (3) use 
these states in a discrete- or continuous-time latent Markov model taking into 
account classification errors. A real data example demonstrates the empirical 
value.

A Low-Phenylalanine-Containing Whey Protein Hydrolysate Stimulates Osteogenic 
Activity through the Activation of p38/Runx2 Signaling in Osteoblast Cells.

Bu T(1)(2), Ren Y(1), Yu S(2), Zheng J(2), Liu L(2), Sun P(1), Wu J(3), Yang 
K(1).

A phenylalanine (Phe)-restricted diet is indispensable for individuals suffering 
from phenylketonuria (PKU). Our previous study reported a low-Phe-containing 
whey protein hydrolysate (LPH) prepared from a selected whey protein hydrolysate 
(TA2H). This study aimed to investigate the osteogenic activity of LPH and TA2H 
in MC3T3-E1 preosteoblast cells and explore the underlying mechanism. Results 
showed that the treatment of TA2H and LPH (at the final concentrations of 
100-1000 μg/mL) had a stimulatory effect on the proliferation, differentiation, 
and mineralization of MC3T3-E1 cells. The LPH of 1000 μg/mL significantly 
increased cell proliferation (2.15- ± 0.11-fold) and alkaline phosphatase 
activity (1.22- ± 0.07-fold), promoted the protein and mRNA levels of 
runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2, 2.50- ± 0.14-fold and 2.97- ± 
0.23-fold, respectively), enhanced the expression of differentiation biomarkers 
(type-I collagen, osteocalcin, and osteopontin), increased calcium deposition 
(1.56- ± 0.08-fold), and upregulated the ratio of osteoprotegerin/receptor 
activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand. The exploration of signaling pathways 
indicated that the activated p38-dependent Runx2 signaling contributed to the 
LPH-induced osteogenesis. These results provided evidence, for the first time, 
that a prepared low-Phe whey protein hydrolysate positively modulated the 
activity of osteoblasts through the p38/Runx2 pathway, thereby providing a new 
osteoinductive protein substitute to make functional PKU food.

Individual Variabilities in Adipose Stem Cell Proliferation, Gene Expression and 
Responses to Lipopolysaccharide Stimulation.

Yasmeen R(1)(2), Pham Q(1), Fukagawa NK(1), Wang TTY(1).

Adipose stem cells (ASCs) are reported to play a role in normal physiology as 
well as in inflammation and disease. The objective of this work was to elucidate 
inter-individual differences in growth, gene expression and response to 
inflammatory stimuli in ASCs from different donors. Human ASC1 (male donor) and 
ASC2 (female donor) were purchased from Lonza (Walkersville, MD). Cell 
proliferation was determined by the sulforhodamine B assay. After time-dependent 
treatment of ASCs with or without bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), marker 
gene mRNAs for proliferation, steroid hormones, and xenobiotic and immune 
pathways were determined using RT-PCR, and secreted cytokine levels in media 
were measured using the Bio-Plex cytokine assay kit. ASCs from both donors 
expressed androgen receptors but not estrogen receptors. ASC2 had a 2-fold 
higher proliferation rate and a 6-fold higher level of proliferation marker Ki67 
mRNA than ASC1. ASC2 exhibited significantly greater fold induction of TNF-α and 
CCL2 by LPS compared to ASC1. TNF-α and GM-CSF protein levels were also 
significantly higher in the LPS-induced ASC2 media, but IL-6 secretion was 
higher in the LPS-induced ASC1 media. Our findings suggest that inter-individual 
variability and/or possible sex differences exist in ASCs, which may serve as a 
key determinant to inflammatory responses of ASCs.

Dual cytoplasmic-peroxisomal engineering for high-yield production of 
sesquiterpene α-humulene in Yarrowia lipolytica.

Guo Q(1)(2), Li YW(1), Yan F(1), Li K(1), Wang YT(1), Ye C(1), Shi TQ(1), Huang 
H(1)(2)(3)(4).

The sesquiterpene α-humulene is an important plant natural product, which has 
been used in the pharmaceutical industry due to its anti-inflammatory and 
anticancer activities. Although phytoextraction and chemical synthesis have 
previously been applied in α-humulene production, the low efficiency and high 
costs limit the development. In this study, Yarrowia lipolytica was engineered 
as the robust cell factory for sustainable α-humulene production. First, a 
chassis with high α-humulene output in the cytoplasm was constructed by 
integrating α-humulene synthases with high catalytic activity, optimizing the 
flux of mevalonate and acetyl-CoA pathways. Subsequently, the strategy of dual 
cytoplasmic-peroxisomal engineering was adopted in Y. lipolytica; the best 
strain GQ3006 generated by introducing 31 copies of 12 different genes could 
produce 2280.3± 38.2 mg/l (98.7 ± 4.2 mg/g dry cell weight) α-humulene, a 
100-fold improvement relative to the baseline strain. To further improve the 
titer, a novel strategy for downregulation of squalene biosynthesis based on 
Cu2+ -repressible promoters was firstly established, which significantly 
improved the α-humulene titer by 54.2% to 3516.6 ± 34.3 mg/l. Finally, the 
engineered strain could produce 21.7 g/l α-humulene in a 5-L bioreactor, 
6.8-fold higher than the highest α-humulene titer reported before this study. 
Overall, system metabolic engineering strategies used in this study provide a 
valuable reference for the highly sustainable production of terpenoids in Y. 
lipolytica.

PCfun: a hybrid computational framework for systematic characterization of 
protein complex function.

Sharma VS(1)(2), Fossati A(3)(4), Ciuffa R(1), Buljan M(5)(6), Williams EG(7), 
Chen Z(8), Shao W(1), Pedrioli PGA(1), Purcell AW(9), Martínez MR(10), Song 
J(9)(11), Manica M(10), Aebersold R(1)(12), Li C(1)(9).

In molecular biology, it is a general assumption that the ensemble of expressed 
molecules, their activities and interactions determine biological function, 
cellular states and phenotypes. Stable protein complexes-or macromolecular 
machines-are, in turn, the key functional entities mediating and modulating most 
biological processes. Although identifying protein complexes and their subunit 
composition can now be done inexpensively and at scale, determining their 
function remains challenging and labor intensive. This study describes Protein 
Complex Function predictor (PCfun), the first computational framework for the 
systematic annotation of protein complex functions using Gene Ontology (GO) 
terms. PCfun is built upon a word embedding using natural language processing 
techniques based on 1 million open access PubMed Central articles. Specifically, 
PCfun leverages two approaches for accurately identifying protein complex 
function, including: (i) an unsupervised approach that obtains the nearest 
neighbor (NN) GO term word vectors for a protein complex query vector and (ii) a 
supervised approach using Random Forest (RF) models trained specifically for 
recovering the GO terms of protein complex queries described in the CORUM 
protein complex database. PCfun consolidates both approaches by performing a 
hypergeometric statistical test to enrich the top NN GO terms within the child 
terms of the GO terms predicted by the RF models. The documentation and 
implementation of the PCfun package are available at 
https://github.com/sharmavaruns/PCfun. We anticipate that PCfun will serve as a 
useful tool and novel paradigm for the large-scale characterization of protein 
complex function.

Galerkin equivalent sources method for sound field reconstruction around 
diffracting bodies.

Chambon J(1), Antoni J(1), Bouley S(2).

The rising interest for three-dimensional acoustic imaging requires the 
improvement of the numerical models describing the propagation between a 
radiating body and a microphone array. The commonly used free field transfer 
functions boil down to assume a full acoustic transparency of the radiating 
object, which, in some cases, may lead to misleading outcomes for their 
characterization. Among other approaches, equivalent sources methods (ESM) 
emerged as a convenient and powerful approach to simulate scattered sound 
fields. In this paper, an acoustic imaging algorithm, named Galerkin ESM, where 
equivalent sources are tailored to concomitantly match with microphone pressures 
and a Neumann boundary condition, is proposed. By means of a projected matrix 
inversion and backpropagation of the equivalent sources, Galerkin ESM aims at 
the direct synthesis of the pressure field around a diffracting body by making 
the most of an array measurement. This method is compared with two other 
existing imaging algorithms fueled by free field and computed transfer 
functions. The impact of the chosen transfer model is discussed, and Galerkin 
ESM performances are evaluated based on numerical and experimental test cases.

Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment from Language Markers with Crossmodal 
Augmentation.

Liu G(1), Xue Z, Zhan L, Dodge HH, Zhou J.

Mild cognitive impairment is the prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease. Its 
detection has been a critical task for establishing cohort studies and 
developing therapeutic interventions for Alzheimer's. Various types of markers 
have been developed for detection. For example, imaging markers from 
neuroimaging have shown great sensitivity, while its cost is still prohibitive 
for large-scale screening of early dementia. Recent advances from digital 
biomarkers, such as language markers, have provided an accessible and affordable 
alternative. While imaging markers give anatomical descriptions of the brain, 
language markers capture the behavior characteristics of early dementia 
subjects. Such differences suggest the benefits of auxiliary information from 
the imaging modality to improve the predictive power of unimodal predictive 
models based on language markers alone. However, one significant barrier to the 
joint analysis is that in typical cohorts, there are only very limited subjects 
that have both imaging and language modalities. To tackle this challenge, in 
this paper, we develop a novel crossmodal augmentation tool, which leverages 
auxiliary imaging information to improve the feature space of language markers 
so that a subject with only language markers can benefit from imaging 
information through the augmentation. Our experimental results show that the 
multi-modal predictive model trained with language markers and auxiliary imaging 
information significantly outperforms unimodal predictive models.

Potency of hyaluronic acid from eggshell-membrane for open gingival embrasure 
reconstruction following orthodontic tooth movement (a histomorphological 
study).

Suparwitri S(1), Alhasyimi AA(1).

BACKGROUND: The aim of this research was to assess the effectiveness of 
eggshell-membrane (ESM)-containing hyaluronic acid (HA) in the treatment of open 
gingival embrasure (OGE) following orthodontic tooth movement (OTM).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is an in vivo quasi experimental research. A 
total of 24 Cavia cobaya were equally divided into two groups, treatment (10% HA 
injection) and control (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]). A separator was 
inserted between mandibular incisors to induce an OGE. A volume of 20 μl of 
either PBS (n = 12) or ESM extract (n = 12) was locally injected within the 
interdental papilla. Decapitation of animals was made on day 1, 4, and 7 
postinjection. The staining was done using hemotoxylin and eosin to observe 
angiogenesis and Mallory to observe the collagen density. Fourier-transform 
infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis were 
performed to detect the amount of HA available in ESM. The results were then 
compared with independent t-tests and the Mann-Whitney test. The level of 
statistical significance was set at 0.05.
RESULTS: The FTIR and TLC analysis showed that HA was successfully identified in 
the ESM samples. Local injection of 10% HA induced an increase of angiogenesis 
compared to the control group on day 1 and 4 postinjection (P < 0.05). 
Significant differences (P < 0.05) were also noted in the collagen density and 
the growth of interdental papilla on day 4 and 7 postinjection.
CONCLUSION: ESM has the potential effect of regenerating the interdental papilla 
construction after OTM by increasing the collagen fiber density and inducing 
angiogenesis.

Integrated serum pharmacochemistry and investigation of the anti-gastric ulcer 
effect of Zuojin pill in rats induced by ethanol.

Zhang J(1), Yin Y(1), Xu Q(1), Che X(1), Yu C(1), Ren Y(1), Li D(2), Zhao J(1).

CONTEXT: Zuojin Pill (ZJP) has been used to treat gastrointestinal problems in 
China for hundreds of years.
OBJECTIVE: To discover more potential active ingredients and evaluate the 
gastroprotective mechanisms of ZJP.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An approach involving UPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS and serum 
pharmacochemistry was established to screen the multiple chemical constituents 
of ZJP. Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were divided into six groups: normal 
control, ulcer control, omeprazole (30 mg/kg), and three ZJP groups (1.0, 2.0 
and 4.0 g/kg). After oral treatment with ZJP or omeprazole for 7 days, all 
groups except the normal control group were orally administered 5 mL/kg ethanol 
to induce gastric ulceration. Histopathological assessment of gastric tissue was 
performed by haematoxylin and eosin staining. Antioxidant parameters and 
inflammatory mediators were determined using ELISA Kit and immunohistochemical 
analysis.
RESULTS: Ninety components were identified in ZJP. Among them, 23 prototypes 
were found in rat serum after oral administration of ZJP. The ulcer inhibition 
was over 90.0% for all the ZJP groups. Compared with the ulcer control rats, ZJP 
(4.0 g/kg) enhanced the antioxidant capacity of gastric tissue: superoxide 
dismutase (1.33-fold), catalase (2.61-fold), glutathione (2.14-fold), and 
reduced the malondialdehyde level (0.48-fold). Simultaneously, the ZJP 
meaningfully lowered the content of tumour necrosis factor-α (0.76-fold), 
interleukin-6 (0.66-fold), myeloperoxidase (0.21-fold), and nuclear factor kappa 
B (p65) (0.62-fold).
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study showed ZJP could mitigate ethanol-induced 
rat gastric ulcers, which might benefit from the synergistic actions of multiple 
ingredients. The findings could support the quality control and clinical trials 
of ZJP.

Epidemiological data demonstrate that Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOCs) Alpha and Delta are more 
transmissible, infectious, and pathogenic than previous variants. Phenotypic 
properties of VOC remain understudied. Here, we provide an extensive functional 
study of VOC Alpha replication and cell entry phenotypes assisted by reverse 
genetics, mutational mapping of spike in lentiviral pseudotypes, viral and 
cellular gene expression studies, and infectivity stability assays in an 
enhanced range of cell and epithelial culture models. In almost all models, VOC 
Alpha spread less or equally efficiently as ancestral (B.1) SARS-CoV-2. B.1. and 
VOC Alpha shared similar susceptibility to serum neutralization. Despite 
increased relative abundance of specific sgRNAs in the context of VOC Alpha 
infection, immune gene expression in infected cells did not differ between VOC 
Alpha and B.1. However, inferior spreading and entry efficiencies of VOC Alpha 
corresponded to lower abundance of proteolytically cleaved spike products 
presumably linked to the T716I mutation. In addition, we identified a bronchial 
cell line, NCI-H1299, which supported 24-fold increased growth of VOC Alpha and 
is to our knowledge the only cell line to recapitulate the fitness advantage of 
VOC Alpha compared to B.1. Interestingly, also VOC Delta showed a strong 
(595-fold) fitness advantage over B.1 in these cells. Comparative analysis of 
chimeric viruses expressing VOC Alpha spike in the backbone of B.1, and vice 
versa, showed that the specific replication phenotype of VOC Alpha in NCI-H1299 
cells is largely determined by its spike protein. Despite undetectable ACE2 
protein expression in NCI-H1299 cells, CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out and 
antibody-mediated blocking experiments revealed that multicycle spread of B.1 
and VOC Alpha required ACE2 expression. Interestingly, entry of VOC Alpha, as 
opposed to B.1 virions, was largely unaffected by treatment with exogenous 
trypsin or saliva prior to infection, suggesting enhanced resistance of VOC 
Alpha spike to premature proteolytic cleavage in the extracellular environment 
of the human respiratory tract. This property may result in delayed degradation 
of VOC Alpha particle infectivity in conditions typical of mucosal fluids of the 
upper respiratory tract that may be recapitulated in NCI-H1299 cells closer than 
in highly ACE2-expressing cell lines and models. Our study highlights the 
importance of cell model evaluation and comparison for in-depth characterization 
of virus variant-specific phenotypes and uncovers a fine-tuned interrelationship 
between VOC Alpha- and host cell-specific determinants that may underlie the 
increased and prolonged virus shedding detected in patients infected with VOC 
Alpha.

Fndc5/irisin is regulated by myogenesis stage, irisin, muscle type and training.

Lavi G(1), Horwitz A(1), Einstein O(2), Zipori R(1), Gross O(1), Birk R(1).

OBJECTIVES: Irisin, a novel myokine that responds to exercise, was initially 
identified as a regulator of fat tissue metabolism. We aimed to investigate 
fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (Fndc5)/irisin, auto/para-crine 
role in different muscle fibers, different activities, and muscle cell 
differentiation.
METHODS: Using in-vitro, ex-vivo, and in-vivo muscle models, Fndc5 was studied 
at the physiological and molecular levels.
RESULTS: Following training, C57BL/6 mice (n=10) were subject to fast and 
slow-twitch muscles dissection and molecular analysis. Isolated mice (C57BL/6, 
n=14) slow and fast-twitch muscles were subject to electrical aerobic and 
anaerobic pulses stimulation (EPS). L6 muscle cells differentiation was 
characterized by Fndc5 differentiation-depended expression pattern parallel with 
significant hypertrophy, Myogenin elevation, and overlapping Peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1 alpha (Pgc-1α) expression 
pattern. Exogenous irisin significantly altered Fndc5 expression; augmented at 
early differentiation (3-4-fold, P<0.05) and decreased (2-fold, P<0.05) at late 
differentiation. Training induced a significant elevation in Fndc5/irisin and 
Pgc-1α expression levels in all muscle types compared to the sedentary state, 
where soleus muscle (slow) Fndc5 expression levels were significantly higher 
compared to levels in all other fast muscles (3-140-fold, P<0.001). Similarly, 
following EPS, Fndc5 expression levels were significantly augmented in the 
soleus slow muscle following both aerobic and anaerobic activity (3-3.5-fold, 
P<0.05) compared to extensor digitorum longus (fast) muscle.
CONCLUSIONS: Muscle cell's Fndc5 expression has a differentiation-depended 
pattern paralleling Pgc-1α expression and hypertrophy. Irisin autocrinally and 
significantly regulate Fndc5 and Pgc-1α in a differentiation-depended manner. 
Muscle Fndc5 expression levels are dependent on fiber type and activity type.

Transdermal delivery of celecoxib and α-linolenic acid from 
microemulsion-incorporated dissolving microneedles for enhanced osteoarthritis 
therapy.

Li J(1), Tian X(1), Wang K(1), Jia Y(1), Ma F(1).

Dissolving microneedles, the promising vehicles for transdermal delivery, are 
incapable of directly loading hydrophobic components that limit the application 
of transdermal drug delivery. Microemulsion holds great potential in the 
solubilisation of water-insoluble drugs but is limited by the high epidermal 
retention. In this study, we fabricated microemulsion-incorporated dissolving 
microneedles co-loading celecoxib and α-linolenic acid (Cel-MEs@MNs) for 
enhancing osteoarthritis (OA) therapy via synergistic anti-inflammation and 
potent transdermal delivery. Cel-MEs@MNs composed of celecoxib & α-linolenic 
acid-coloaded microemulsion (Cel-MEs) and hyaluronic acid-based microneedles 
(MNs) can be completely dissolved in 90 s with a particle size of ∼30 nm. Each 
microneedle array with a hardness exceeding 30 N contained 57.9 ± 2.5 μg of 
celecoxib and 442.5 ± 24.2 μg of α-linolenic acid. The 8 h-cumulative 
transdermal of celecoxib from Cel-MEs@MNs was 89.2 ± 5.1 μg celecoxib/cm2, which 
is 2.98-fold higher than that from Cel-MEs. Combinational celecoxib and 
α-linolenic acid with a weight ratio of 1/5 can synergistically induce M1-like 
macrophage to M2 repolarization, reduce M1-like macrophages-resulted 
chondrocytes apoptosis, and lower serum prostaglandin E-2 (PGE-2). Notably, 
Cel-MEs@MNs amplified such collaborated anti-inflammatory effects. More 
importantly, in the treatment of OA-bearing rat models, Cel-MEs@MNs with a 
half-dose of celecoxib and α-linolenic acid significantly shrunk the paw 
swelling, reduced inflammatory cytokines, and improved cartilage damage compared 
with the oral administration of celecoxib and α-linolenic acid, as well as 
transdermal administration of Cel-MEs. Such an integrational strategy of 
microemulsion-incorporated dissolving MNs offers the feasibility of 
combinational celecoxib and α-linolenic acid in transdermal permeation and 
boosted OA therapy.

Hurting all the way: The emotional antecedent and consequence of social 
rejection.

Wang X(1), Li M(2).

Social rejection is cold and hurtful, but how and why it is formed remains 
under-investigated. Our study offers one possible explanation from the 
rejector's perspective by developing a moderated mediation model on the 
emotional antecedent and consequence of social rejection. Specifically, envious 
individuals use social rejection to complement their inferiority, further 
triggering their negative affect. Drawing on social comparison theory, we 
conducted an experience sampling methodology (ESM) investigation of 55 frontline 
workers through a 10-workday-survey (Level 1 n = 515). As predicted, daily envy 
is positively associated with daily social rejection. Daily social rejection is 
positively related to daily negative affect. Furthermore, daily social rejection 
mediates the relationship between daily envy and daily negative affect. These 
effects are more robust for females than males, including the impact of envy on 
social rejection and the impact of envy on negative affect via social rejection. 
We suggest the recipient and the rejector make psychological and behavioral 
adjustments accordingly. We also recommend that future research extend our 
current study methodologically and theoretically.

Acceptor dependent catalytic properties of GH57 4-α-glucanotransferase from 
Pyrococcus sp. ST04.

Jung JH(1), Hong S(2), Jeon EJ(3), Kim MK(1), Seo DH(4), Woo EJ(5), Holden 
JF(6), Park CS(7).

The 4-α-glucanotransferase (4-α-GTase or amylomaltase) is an essential enzyme in 
maltodextrin metabolism. Generally, most bacterial 4-α-GTase is classified into 
glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 77. However, hyperthermophiles have unique 
4-α-GTases belonging to GH family 57. These enzymes are the main amylolytic 
protein in hyperthermophiles, but their mode of action in maltooligosaccharide 
utilization is poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the 
catalytic properties of 4-α-GTase from the hyperthermophile Pyrococcus sp. ST04 
(PSGT) in the presence of maltooligosaccharides of various lengths. Unlike 
4-α-GTases in GH family 77, GH family 57 PSGT produced maltotriose in the early 
stage of reaction and preferred maltose and maltotriose over glucose as the 
acceptor. The kinetic analysis showed that maltotriose had the lowest KM value, 
which increased amylose degradation activity by 18.3-fold. Structural models of 
PSGT based on molecular dynamic simulation revealed two aromatic amino acids 
interacting with the substrate at the +2 and +3 binding sites, and the 
mutational study demonstrated they play a critical role in maltotriose binding. 
These results clarify the mode of action in carbohydrate utilization and explain 
acceptor binding mechanism of GH57 family 4-α-GTases in hyperthermophilic 
archaea.

[Research progress on the role of endothelial cell-specific molecular-1 in acute 
respiratory distress syndrome].

[Article in Chinese]

Ye Y(1), Su S, Zhou Y, Yan Y, Li Y.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a common respiratory critical 
illness with multiple causes, is associated with high mortality. The high degree 
of heterogeneity may be the reason why it is lack of highly specific and 
sensitive biological biomarkers. Therefore, it is an urgent need to explore 
biomarkers, perform phenotypic analysis and establish risk stratification model 
for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of ARDS. Endothelial cells specificity 
molecular-1 (ESM-1, endocan), is a soluble dermatan sulfate proteoglycan, and be 
involved in regulating biological behaviors such as cell proliferation, 
differentiation and migration. Numerous studies have confirmed that ESM-1 is 
closely related to inflammation, endothelial activation and dysfunction. 
However, the role of ESM-1 in the initiating and developing process of ARDS is 
still unclear. To provide a scientific basis for its clinical applications in 
ARDS, such as early prognosis assessment and timely prevent strategies, this 
paper focuses on the biological properties and the clinical value of ESM-1 as a 
potential biomarker for ARDS.

Effects of a maternal mindfulness intervention targeting prenatal psychological 
distress on infants' meconium microbiota: A randomized controlled trial.

Zhang X(1), Mao F(1), Li Y(2), Wang J(1), Wu L(1), Sun J(3), Cao F(4).

BACKGROUND: Maternal psychological distress could affect gut microbiota of the 
infant; however, previous studies to date have been observational.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) 
during pregnancy on the meconium microbiota of infants by alleviating maternal 
psychological distress.
DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial.
METHOD: Pregnant women with symptoms of depression or anxiety were randomized to 
either the intervention group (n = 80), comprising usual perinatal care and six 
digitally guided self-help MBI sessions, or the control group (n = 80) who 
underwent usual perinatal care. Meconium was collected within 48 h of birth to 
evaluate the infant's gut microbiota. The Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test, analysis 
of similarities, and DESeq2 were performed to explore the effects of the MBI on 
alpha and beta diversity indices and specific genera.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences between groups regarding the 
alpha diversity indices, including Chao1 and Simpson (p = 0.83 and p = 0.58). 
However, there was a significant between-group difference in the beta diversity 
index (R=0.02, p = 0.03). Bifidobacterium (log2 fold change=-1.90, FDR=0.002) 
and Blautia (log2 fold change=-1.45, FDR=0.01) were abundant in the intervention 
group, whereas Staphylococcus (log2 fold change=1.44, FDR=0.01) was abundant in 
the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: MBI aimed at alleviating maternal psychological distress can 
positively alter the meconium microbiota of infants. However, the mechanisms 
underlying the effects of maternal mindfulness during pregnancy on infant 
meconium microbiota require further exploration.

Selective Isotope Labeling and LC-Photo-CIDNP Enable NMR Spectroscopy at 
Low-Nanomolar Concentration.

Yang H(1), Li S(1), Mickles CA(1), Guzman-Luna V(1), Sugisaki K(2)(3), Thompson 
CM(1), Dang HH(1), Cavagnero S(1).

NMR spectroscopy is a powerful tool to investigate molecular structure and 
dynamics. The poor sensitivity of this technique, however, limits its ability to 
tackle questions requiring dilute samples. Low-concentration photochemically 
induced dynamic nuclear polarization (LC-photo-CIDNP) is an optically enhanced 
NMR technology capable of addressing the above challenge by increasing the 
detection limit of aromatic amino acids in solution up to 1000-fold, either in 
isolation or within proteins. Here, we show that the absence of NMR-active 
nuclei close to a magnetically active site of interest (e.g., the structurally 
diagnostic 1Hα-13Cα pair of amino acids) is expected to significantly increase 
LC-photo-CIDNP hyperpolarization. Then, we exploit the spin-diluted tryptophan 
isotopolog Trp-α-13C-β,β,2,4,5,6,7-d7 and take advantage of the above prediction 
to experimentally achieve a ca 4-fold enhancement in NMR sensitivity over 
regular LC-photo-CIDNP. This advance enables the rapid (within seconds) 
detection of 20 nM concentrations or the molecule of interest, corresponding to 
a remarkable 3 ng detection limit. Finally, the above Trp isotopolog is amenable 
to incorporation within proteins and is readily detectable at a 1 μM 
concentration in complex cell-like media, including Escherichia coli cell-free 
extracts.

Expression and characterization of α-L-arabinofuranosidase derived from 
Aspergillus awamori and its enzymatic degradation of corn byproducts with 
xylanase.

Li C(1), Cao H(1), Wu W(1), Meng G(2), Zhao C(2), Cao Y(1), Yuan J(3).

In this study, α-L-arabinofuranosidase (AF) from Aspergillus awamori was 
heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris X33, with a 1-fold increase in AF 
activity after codon and vector optimization. AF remained stable at 60-65 °C and 
displayed a broad pH stability range of 2.5-8.0. It also demonstrated 
considerable resistance to pepsin and trypsin. Furthermore, compared with 
xylanase alone, AF with xylanase exhibited a marked synergistic effect in the 
degradation of expanded corn bran, corn bran, and corn distillers' dried grains 
with solubles, reducing sugars by 3.6-fold, 1.4-fold, and 6.5-fold, 
respectively, with the degree of synergy increasing to 4.61, 2.44, and 5.4, 
respectively, while in vitro dry matter digestibility values were 17.6%, 5.2%, 
and 8.8%, respectively. After enzymatic saccharification, corn byproducts were 
converted to prebiotic xylo-oligosaccharides and arabinoses, thereby 
demonstrating the favorable properties of AF in the degradation of corn biomass 
and its byproducts.

mHealth in psychiatry: A pathway to person-centered care.

Myin-Germeys I(1).

Influenced by the field of epidemiology and the early ecological psychologists, 
my research focused on the role of person-environment interactions in the 
development and maintenance of psychopathology - a field I would name Contextual 
Psychiatry. To capture the interaction between the person and the environment, I 
was one of the early adopters of the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) in mental 
health research. Using ESM, we demonstrated that there is an affective pathway 
to psychosis, characterized by increased stress-reactivity. Also altered social 
interactions have been identified as an important factor in the development of 
psychopathology. With digital technology quickly evolving, the impact of my work 
has now been extended to the development and implementation of mHealth and 
digital Health approaches in mental health, including the clinical application 
of ESM in routine mental health care as well as the development of Ecological 
Momentary Interventions. Moving forward, if we want to deliver treatment at 
moments when it is most needed and adapted to the needs of the individual, we 
need to advance our understanding of the real-time dynamics of the psychological 
and physiological processes of psychopathology - thus establishing a more 
personalised mental health care.

Methylglyoxal - an advanced glycation end products (AGEs) precursor - Inhibits 
differentiation of human MSC-derived osteoblasts in vitro independently of 
receptor for AGEs (RAGE).

Waqas K(1), Muller M(1), Koedam M(1), El Kadi Y(1), Zillikens MC(1), van der 
Eerden BCJ(2).

A major precursor of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) - methylglyoxal (MG) 
- is a reactive carbonyl metabolite that originates from glycolytic pathways. MG 
formation and accumulation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetes 
and age-related chronic musculoskeletal disorders. Human bone marrow-derived 
stromal cells (BMSCs) are multipotent cells that have the potential to 
differentiate into cells of mesenchymal origin including osteoblasts, but the 
role of MG on their differentiation is unclear. We therefore evaluated the 
effect of MG on proliferation and differentiation of BMSC-derived osteoblasts. 
Cells were treated with different concentrations of MG (600, 800 and 1000 μM). 
Cell viability was assessed using a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. Alkaline 
phosphatase (ALP) activity and calcium deposition assays were performed to 
evaluate osteoblast differentiation and mineralization. Gene expression was 
measured using qRT-PCR, whereas AGE specific receptor (RAGE) and collagen 1 were 
examined by immunocytochemistry and Western blotting. RAGE knockdown was 
performed by transducing RAGE specific short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) using 
lentivirus. During osteogenic differentiation, MG treatment resulted in 
reduction of cell viability (27.7 %), ALP activity (45.5 %) and mineralization 
(82.3 %) compared to untreated cells. MG significantly decreased expression of 
genes involved in osteogenic differentiation - RUNX2 (2.8 fold), ALPL (3.2 
fold), MG detoxification through glyoxalase - GLO1 (3 fold) and collagen 
metabolism - COL1A1 (4.9 fold), COL1A2 (6.8 fold), LOX (5.4 fold) and PLOD1 (1.7 
fold). MG significantly reduced expression of collagen 1 (53.3 %) and RAGE 
(43.1 %) at protein levels. Co-treatment with a MG scavenger - aminoguanidine - 
prevented all negative effects of MG. RAGE-specific knockdown during MG 
treatment did not reverse the effects on cell viability, osteogenic 
differentiation or collagen metabolism. In conclusion, MG treatment can 
negatively influence the collagen metabolism and differentiation of 
BMSCs-derived osteoblasts through a RAGE independent mechanism.

Improving language model of human genome for DNA-protein binding prediction 
based on task-specific pre-training.

Luo H(1), Shan W(1), Chen C(1), Ding P(1), Luo L(2)(3).

The DNA-protein binding plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression and 
evolution, and computational identification of DNA-protein has drawn more and 
more attention in bioinformatics. Recently, variants of BERT are also used to 
capture the semantic information of DNA sequences for predicting DNA-protein 
bindings. In this study, we leverage a task-specific pre-training strategy on 
BERT using large-scale multi-source DNA-protein binding data and present TFBert. 
TFBert treats DNA sequences as natural sentences and k-mer nucleotides as words. 
It can effectively extract upstream and downstream nucleotide context 
information by pre-training the 690 unlabeled ChIP-seq datasets. Experiments 
show that the pre-trained model can achieve promising performance on every 
single dataset in the 690 ChIP-seq datasets after simple fine tuning, especially 
on small datasets. The average AUC is 94.7%, outperforming existing popular 
methods. In conclusion, this study provides a variant of BERT based on 
pre-training and achieved state-of-the-art results in predicting DNA-protein 
bindings. We believe that TFBert can provide insights into other biological 
sequence classification problems.

Combining Experience Sampling and Mobile Sensing for Digital Phenotyping With 
m-Path Sense: Performance Study.

Niemeijer K(1), Mestdagh M(1), Verdonck S(1), Meers K(1), Kuppens P(1).

BACKGROUND: The experience sampling methodology (ESM) has long been considered 
as the gold standard for gathering data in everyday life. In contrast, current 
smartphone technology enables us to acquire data that are much richer, more 
continuous, and unobtrusive than is possible via ESM. Although data obtained 
from smartphones, known as mobile sensing, can provide useful information, its 
stand-alone usefulness is limited when not combined with other sources of 
information such as data from ESM studies. Currently, there are few mobile apps 
available that allow researchers to combine the simultaneous collection of ESM 
and mobile sensing data. Furthermore, such apps focus mostly on passive data 
collection with only limited functionality for ESM data collection.
OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we presented and evaluated the performance of m-Path 
Sense, a novel, full-fledged, and secure ESM platform with background mobile 
sensing capabilities.
METHODS: To create an app with both ESM and mobile sensing capabilities, we 
combined m-Path, a versatile and user-friendly platform for ESM, with the 
Copenhagen Research Platform Mobile Sensing framework, a reactive cross-platform 
framework for digital phenotyping. We also developed an R package, named 
mpathsenser, which extracts raw data to an SQLite database and allows the user 
to link and inspect data from both sources. We conducted a 3-week pilot study in 
which we delivered ESM questionnaires while collecting mobile sensing data to 
evaluate the app's sampling reliability and perceived user experience. As m-Path 
is already widely used, the ease of use of the ESM system was not investigated.
RESULTS: Data from m-Path Sense were submitted by 104 participants, totaling 
69.51 GB (430.43 GB after decompression) or approximately 37.50 files or 31.10 
MB per participant per day. After binning accelerometer and gyroscope data to 1 
value per second using summary statistics, the entire SQLite database contained 
84,299,462 observations and was 18.30 GB in size. The reliability of sampling 
frequency in the pilot study was satisfactory for most sensors, based on the 
absolute number of collected observations. However, the relative coverage 
rate-the ratio between the actual and expected number of measurements-was below 
its target value. This could mostly be ascribed to gaps in the data caused by 
the operating system pushing away apps running in the background, which is a 
well-known issue in mobile sensing. Finally, some participants reported mild 
battery drain, which was not considered problematic for the assessed 
participants' perceived user experience.
CONCLUSIONS: To better study behavior in everyday life, we developed m-Path 
Sense, a fusion of both m-Path for ESM and Copenhagen Research Platform Mobile 
Sensing. Although reliable passive data collection with mobile phones remains 
challenging, it is a promising approach toward digital phenotyping when combined 
with ESM.

Mechanism by Which Cholesterol Induces Sphingomyelin Conformational Changes at 
an Air/Water Interface.

Li Y(1)(2), Feng R(1)(2), Liu M(3)(2), Guo Y(1)(2), Zhang Z(1)(2).

This work investigates the interactions in cholesterol and sphingomyelin 
monolayers at the molecular level by high-resolution broadband sum frequency 
generation vibrational spectroscopy (HR-BB-SFG-VS). The SFG spectra of natural 
egg sphingomyelin (ESM) as a function of cholesterol concentration are obtained 
at an air/water interface under different polarization combinations. The 
analysis of the spectra shows that cholesterol can induce sphingomyelin 
conformational changes at an air/water interface. The mechanism is proposed. 
When cholesterol is inserted into the ESM monolayer, the inherent intramolecular 
hydrogen bonds between the phosphate moiety and 3OH in the sphingosine backbones 
are destroyed. During this process, the sphingosine backbones become more 
ordered, while the conformation of the N-linked long acid chain remains 
unaltered. The OH of the cholesterol head group can bind to the -PO-2 of the ESM 
molecule, and the orientation of the -PO-2 in the head groups changes to be more 
parallel to the interface.

Eggshell membrane-incorporated cell friendly tough hydrogels with ultra-adhesive 
property.

Gwon Y(1), Park S(2), Kim W(1), Kim H(1), Kim J(3).

Adhesive and tough hydrogels have received increased attention for their 
potential biomedical applications. However, traditional hydrogels have limited 
utility in tissue engineering because they tend to exhibit low biocompatibility, 
low adhesiveness, and poor mechanical properties. Herein, the use of the 
eggshell membrane (ESM) for developing tough, cell-friendly, and ultra-adhesive 
hydrogels is described. The ESM enhances the performance of the hydrogel network 
in three ways. First, its covalent cross-linking with the polyacrylamide and 
alginate chains strengthens the hydrogel network. Second, it provides functional 
groups, such as amine and carboxyl moieties, which are well known for enhancing 
the surface adhesion of biomaterials, thereby increasing the adhesiveness of the 
hydrogel. Third, it is a bioactive agent and improves cell adhesion and 
proliferation on the constructed scaffold. In conclusion, this study proposes 
the unique design of ESM-incorporated hydrogels with high toughness, 
cell-friendly, and ultra-adhesive properties for various biomedical engineering 
applications.

Distinct glycerophospholipids potentiate Gsα-activated adenylyl cyclase 
activity.

Seth A(1), Landau M(2), Shevchenko A(3), Traikov S(3), Schultz A(2), Elsabbagh 
S(2), Schultz JE(4).

Nine mammalian adenylyl cyclases (AC) are pseudoheterodimers with two 
hexahelical membrane domains, which are isoform-specifically conserved. 
Previously we proposed that these membrane domains are orphan receptors 
(https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13098; 
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cellsig.2020.109538). Lipids extracted from fetal 
bovine serum at pH 1 inhibited several mAC activities. Guided by a lipidomic 
analysis we tested glycerophospholipids as potential ligands. Contrary to 
expectations we surprisingly discovered that 
1-stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl-phosphatidic acid (SDPA) potentiated Gsα-activated 
activity of human AC isoform 3 seven-fold. The specificity of fatty acyl esters 
at glycerol positions 1 and 2 was rather stringent. 
1-Stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl-phosphatidylserine and 
1-stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine significantly potentiated 
several Gsα-activated mAC isoforms to different extents. SDPA appears not 
interact with forskolin activation of AC isoform 3. SDPA enhanced Gsα-activated 
AC activities in membranes from mouse brain cortex. The action of SDPA was 
reversible. Unexpectedly, SDPA did not affect cAMP generation in HEK293 cells 
stimulated by isoproterenol, PGE2 and adenosine, virtually excluding a role as 
an extracellular ligand and, instead, suggesting an intracellular role. In 
summary, we discovered a new dimension of intracellular AC regulation by 
chemically defined glycerophospholipids.

Hao E(1).

Linear π-conjugated oligopyrroles are attractive precursors for the synthesis of 
expanded porphyrinoids, chemosensors, and supramolecular motifs. We demonstrate 
a new method for the synthesis of a set of linear pyrrolyltripyrrins and 
dipyrrolyltripyrrins through a regioselective SNAr reaction on 
α,α'-dibromotripyrrins using various pyrroles or indoles. A representative 
calixsmaragdyrin was prepared via the 2-fold SNAr reaction between 
α,α'-dibromotripyrrin and dipyrromethene through a convergent [3 + 2] strategy. 
These oligopyrroles showed intense deep red absorptions with an interesting pH 
response.

Antioxidant Status and Biotechnological Potential of New Vischeria vischeri 
(Eustigmatophyceae) Soil Strains in Enrichment Cultures.

Maltsev Y(2).

The functional state of enrichment cultures of the Eustigmatophycean strains 
Vischeria vischeri MZ-E3 and MZ-E4 after 25-day cultivation in the BBM medium 
was studied. The concentrations of chlorophyll a, total carotenoids, protein, 
vitamins A and E, fatty acid peroxidation product content, an antioxidant 
enzyme, and succinate dehydrogenase activity were measured. MZ-E3 succinate 
dehydrogenase activity was significantly higher by 2.21 times; the MZ-E4 strain 
had 2.94 times higher glutathione peroxidase activity. The MZ-E3 antioxidant 
activity index and the MZ-E3 unsaturation of fatty acids were 1.3 and 1.25 times 
higher than the MZ-E4. The retinol and α-tocopherol content of the MZ-E3 was 
28.6% and 38.76% higher than MZ-E4. The main fatty acid profile differences were 
the 3.46-fold and 3.92-fold higher stearic and eicosapentaenoic acid content in 
the MZ-E4 biomass. MZ-E3 had higher antioxidant, energy, and metabolic and 
photosynthetic status than MZ-E4. The antioxidant status of the studied strains 
showed the dependence of the adaptive mechanisms of each, associated with 
differences in the ecological conditions of the biotopes from which they were 
isolated. These strains are promising for producing α-tocopherol and biomass 
enriched with omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids.

Intramolecular C-C Bond Formation Links Anthraquinone and Enediyne Scaffolds in 
Tiancimycin Biosynthesis.

Gui C, Kalkreuter E, Liu YC, Adhikari A(1), Teijaro CN, Yang D, Chang C(2), Shen 
B(1).

First discovered in 1989, the anthraquinone-fused enediynes are a class of 
DNA-cleaving bacterial natural products composed of a DNA-intercalating 
anthraquinone moiety and a 10-membered enediyne warhead. However, until 
recently, there has been a lack of genetically amenable hosts and sequenced 
biosynthetic gene clusters available for solving the biosynthetic questions 
surrounding these molecules. Herein, we have identified and biochemically and 
structurally characterized TnmK1, a member of the α/β-hydrolase fold superfamily 
responsible for the C-C bond formation linking the anthraquinone moiety and 
enediyne core together in tiancimycin (TNM) biosynthesis. In doing so, two 
intermediates, TNM H and TNM I, in anthraquinone-fused enediyne biosynthesis, 
containing an unprecedented cryptic C16 aldehyde group, were identified. This 
aldehyde plays a key role in the TnmK1-catalyzed C-C bond formation via a 
Michael addition, representing the first example of this chemistry for the 
α/β-hydrolase fold superfamily. Additionally, TNM I shows sub-nanomolar 
cytotoxicity against selected cancer cell lines, indicating a new mechanism of 
action compared to previously known anthraquinone-fused enediynes. Together, the 
findings from this study are expected to impact enzymology, natural product 
biosynthesis, and future efforts at enediyne discovery and drug development.

Assessing the reliability of single-item momentary affective measurements in 
experience sampling.

Dejonckheere E(1), Demeyer F(1), Geusens B(1), Piot M(1), Tuerlinckx F(1), 
Verdonck S(1), Mestdagh M(1).

Emotion researchers that use experience sampling methods (ESM) study how 
emotions fluctuate in everyday life. To reach valid conclusions, confirming the 
reliability of momentary emotion measurements is essential. However, to minimize 
participant burden, ESM researchers often use single-item measures, preventing a 
reliability assessment of people's emotion ratings. Furthermore, because 
emotions constantly change, checking reliability via conventional test-retest 
procedures is impractical, for it is impossible to separate measurement error 
from meaningful emotional variability. Here, drawing from classical test theory 
(CTT), we propose two time-varying test-retest adaptations to evaluate the 
reliability of single-item (emotion) measures in ESM. Following Method 1, we 
randomly repeat one emotion item within the same momentary survey and evaluate 
the discrepancy between test and retest ratings to determine reliability. 
Following Method 2, we introduce a subsequent, shortly delayed retest survey and 
extrapolate the size of test-retest discrepancies to the hypothetical instance 
where no time between assessments would exist. First, in an analytical study, we 
establish the mathematical relation between observed test-retest discrepancies 
and measurement error variance for both methods, based on common assumptions in 
the CTT literature. Second, in two empirical studies, we apply both methods to 
real-life emotion time series and find that the size of error in people's 
emotion ratings corresponds with almost a 10th of the scale, comprising around 
27% of the total variability in participants' affective responses. Consequently, 
disregarding measurement error in ESM is problematic, and we encourage 
researchers to include a test-retest procedure in their future studies when 
relying on single-item measures. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all

microRNA-122 inhibits hepatic stellate cell proliferation and activation in 
vitro and represses carbon tetrachloride-induced liver cirrhosis in mice.

Ma J(1), Zhao Q(1), Chen M(1), Wang W(1), He B(1), Jiang Y(1), Li Y(2).

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the roles of microRNA (miR)-122 in the 
activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and liver cirrhosis.
METHODS: Rat primary HSCs were incubated with transforming growth factor-beta 
(TGF-β), during which miR-122 and EphB2 expression was measured. miR-122 mimic 
and/or pcDNA3.1 EphB2 was transfected into TGF-β-induced HSCs. A mouse model of 
liver cirrhosis was established via an intraperitoneal injection of carbon 
tetrachloride (CCl4), followed by the injection of miR-122 agomir. Levels of 
serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were 
measured. Fibronectin (FN), alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), Collagen I, 
miR-122, and EphB2 expression was evaluated in liver tissues and HSCs. Cell 
proliferation was measured using CCK-8 assay. Interactions between miR-122 and 
EphB2 were assessed using dual luciferase reporter assay.
RESULTS: miR-122 (0.15-fold) was downregulated and EphB2 (mRNA: 5.06-fold; 
protein: 2.35-fold) was upregulated after TGF-β induction of HSCs. Overexpressed 
miR-122 decreased proliferation and EphB2 (mRNA: 0.46-fold; protein: 0.62-fold), 
FN (mRNA: 0.45-fold; protein: 0.64-fold), α-SMA (mRNA: 0.48-fold; protein: 
0.51-fold), and Collagen I (mRNA: 0.44-fold; protein: 0.51-fold) expression in 
HSCs, which was abrogated by EphB2 upregulation. miR-122 expression was reduced 
by 0.21-fold and serum ALT and AST levels were enhanced in mice following 8-week 
CCl4 induction along with increased expression of FN, α-SMA, and Collagen I in 
liver tissues, which was blocked by miR-122 overexpression. Moreover, EphB2 was 
a target gene of miR-122.
CONCLUSION: miR-122 curtails HSC proliferation and activation by targeting EphB2 
and suppresses liver cirrhosis in mice.

The relationship between daily positive future thinking and past-week suicidal 
ideation in youth: An experience sampling study.

Kirtley OJ(1)(2)(3), Lafit G(1)(4), Vaessen T(1)(5), Decoster J(6), Derom 
C(7)(8), Gülöksüz S(9)(10), De Hert M(2)(11)(12)(13), Jacobs N(14)(15),

Winkel R(11)(12), Wichers M(19), Myin-Germeys I(1)(2)(3).

Reduced positive future thinking has been associated with suicidal ideation and 
behavior in adults, and appears to be exacerbated by negative affect. Yet, this 
has received little attention in youth. Prior research has also focused on 
longer-term future thinking, e.g., months and years, and relied on lab-based 
assessments. Using the experience sampling method (ESM), we investigated whether 
short-term future thinking in daily life was associated with suicidal ideation 
in youth and explored the role of affect in the future thinking-suicidal 
ideation relationship. A community sample of N = 722 adolescent twins and their 
non-twin siblings completed ESM as part of the TwinssCan study (n = 55 with, and 
n = 667 without, past-week suicidal ideation). Participants completed 
self-report questionnaires, including on past-week suicidal ideation as part of 
the SCL-90. Subsequently, daily future thinking was assessed each morning for 
six days with ESM. To investigate the relationship between daily positive future 
thinking and past-week suicidal ideation, we estimated a mixed-effects linear 
regression model with a random intercept for participant, including age and sex 
as covariates. The relationship between daily positive future thinking, 
past-week suicidal ideation, and average positive and negative affect from the 
previous day was investigated by estimating two separate mixed-effects linear 
regression models (one for negative affect, one for positive affect), with a 
random intercept for participant, and random slopes for average positive and 
negative affect. Our results showed that participants reporting higher past-week 
suicidal ideation also reported significantly less daily positive future 
thinking during the ESM period, and this association remained significant when 
controlling for previous-day average positive and negative affect. Higher 
average positive affect from the previous day was significantly associated with 
higher positive future thinking. Although average negative affect from the 
previous day was associated with lower positive future thinking, this 
association was not statistically significant. Our findings indicate that 
short-term future thinking relates to suicidal ideation among a non-clinical 
sample of adolescents. Future research should investigate the directionality of 
the future thinking-suicidal ideation relationship, in order to investigate 
whether impaired future thinking may be an early warning signal for escalating 
suicidal ideation in youth.

E-SNPs&GO: embedding of protein sequence and function improves the annotation of 
human pathogenic variants.

Manfredi M(1), Savojardo C(1), Martelli PL(1), Casadio R(1).

MOTIVATION: The advent of massive DNA sequencing technologies is producing a 
huge number of human single-nucleotide polymorphisms occurring in protein-coding 
regions and possibly changing their sequences. Discriminating harmful protein 
variations from neutral ones is one of the crucial challenges in precision 
medicine. Computational tools based on artificial intelligence provide models 
for protein sequence encoding, bypassing database searches for evolutionary 
information. We leverage the new encoding schemes for an efficient annotation of 
protein variants.
RESULTS: E-SNPs&GO is a novel method that, given an input protein sequence and a 
single amino acid variation, can predict whether the variation is related to 
diseases or not. The proposed method adopts an input encoding completely based 
on protein language models and embedding techniques, specifically devised to 
encode protein sequences and GO functional annotations. We trained our model on 
a newly generated dataset of 101 146 human protein single amino acid variants in 
13 661 proteins, derived from public resources. When tested on a blind set 
comprising 10 266 variants, our method well compares to recent approaches 
released in literature for the same task, reaching a Matthews Correlation 
Coefficient score of 0.72. We propose E-SNPs&GO as a suitable, efficient and 
accurate large-scale annotator of protein variant datasets.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The method is available as a webserver at 
https://esnpsandgo.biocomp.unibo.it. Datasets and predictions are available at

Synthesis of Nitrone-derived Pyrrolidine Scaffolds and Their Combinatorial 
Libraries to Develop Selective α-l-Rhamnosidase Inhibitors.

Chen WA(1), Li HY(1), Sayyad A(1), Huang CY(1), Cheng WC(1)(2)(3)(4).

A general and flexible approach toward the development of α-l-rhamnosidase 
(α-l-Rha-ase) inhibitors is described. Five enantiopure poly-substituted 
pyrrolidine-based scaffolds bearing the C1-aminomethyl moiety were designed and 
synthesized from five-membered cyclic nitrones. Each structurally diversified 
amide library of these scaffolds was rapidly generated via combinatorial 
parallel synthesis and applied for in-situ inhibition study against α-l-Rha-ase, 
allowing us to efficiently identify new inhibition hits. Surprisingly, all 
promising inhibitors are derived from the same scaffold 3. Among them, the most 
potent and selective inhibitor is pyrrolidine 19 with Ki =0.24 μM, approximately 
24-fold more potent than the reference compound DAA (Ki =5.7 μM). It is the 
first study to comprehensively prepare pyrrolidine-based scaffolds and libraries 
for inhibition study against α-l-Rha-ase.

Engineering of Bacillus Promoters Based on Interacting Motifs between UP 
Elements and RNA Polymerase (RNAP) α-Subunit.

Gu Z(1)(2)(3), Shi G(1)(2)(3).

Bacillus genetics need more versatile promoters for gene circuit engineering. UP 
elements are widely distributed in noncoding regions and interact with the 
α-subunit of RNA polymerase (RNAP). They can be applied as a standard element 
for synthetic biology. Characterization of the binding motif between UP elements 
and RNAP may assist with rational and effective engineering. In this study, 11 
Bacillus constitutive promoters were screened for strength in Bacillus 
licheniformis. The motif in UP elements from a strong native promoter, PLan, was 
characterized. The influence of specific sequences on RNAP binding and 
expression strength was investigated both in vitro and in vivo. It was found 
that sequences up to 50 base pairs upstream of the consensus motif significantly 
contributed to α-CTD (the alpha subunit carboxy-terminal domain) association. 
Meanwhile, two repeats of a proximal subsite were able to more strongly activate 
the expression (by 8.2-fold) through strengthening interactions between UP 
elements and RNAP. Based the above molecular basis, a synthetic UP element, 
UP5-2P, was constructed and applied to nine wild-type promoters. Fluorescence 
polarization results demonstrated that it had an apparent effect on 
promoter-α-CTD interactions, and elevated expression strength was observed for 
all the engineered promoters. The highest improved core promoter, Pacpp, was 
more strongly activated by 7.4-fold. This work thus develops a novel strategy 
for Bacillus promoter engineering.

Production, purification, characterization, and applications of α-galactosidase 
from Bacillus flexus JS27 isolated from Manikaran hot springs.

Bhatia S(1)(2), Batra N(2), Singh J(1).

α-Galactosidase hydrolyzes the α-1,6-linkage present at the non-reducing end of 
the sugars and results in the release of galactosyl residue from 
oligosaccharides like melibiose, raffinose, stachyose, etc. In the present study 
we report, α-galactosidase from Bacillus flexus isolated from Manikaran hot 
springs (India). Maximum enzyme production was obtained in guar gum and soybean 
meal after 72 h at 150 rpm. While, the temperature/pH of production was 
optimized at 50 °C and 7.0, respectively. Isoenzymes (α-gal I and II) were 
obtained and characterized based on temperature/pH optima along with their 
stability profile. JS27 α-Gal II was purified with a final purification fold of 
11.54. Native and SDS-PAGE were used to determine the molecular weight of the 
enzyme as 86 and 41 kDa, respectively, indicating its homodimeric form. JS27 
α-Gal II showed optimum enzyme activity at 55 °C and pH 7 (10 min). The enzyme 
displayed Km value of 2.3809 mM and Vmax of 2.0 × 104 µmol/min/ml with pNPG as 
substrate. JS27 α-Gal II demonstrated substrate hydrolysis and simultaneous 
formation of transgalactosylation products (α-GOS) with numerous substrates 
(sugar/sugar alcohols, oligosaccharides, and complex carbohydrates) which were 
verified by TLC and HPLC analysis. α-GOS are significant functional food 
ingredients and can be explored as prebiotics.

(AI) in those countries. Technological improvements in AI have created high 
expectations in health care. AI is recognized increasingly as a game changer in 
clinical radiology. To counter the fear that AI would "take over" radiology, the 
program included activities to educate radiologists. The development of AI in 
Latin America is in its early days, and although there are some pioneer cases, 
many regions still lack world-class technological infrastructure and resources. 
Legislation, regulation, and public policies in data privacy and protection, 
digital health, and AI are recent advances in many countries. The meeting 
program was developed with a broad scope, with expertise from different 
countries, backgrounds, and specialties, with the objective of encompassing all 
levels of complexity (from basic concepts to advanced techniques), perspectives 
(clinical, technical, ethical, and business), and specialties (both informatics 
and data science experts and the usual radiology clinical groups). It was an 
opportunity to connect with peers from other countries and share lessons learned 
about AI in health care in different countries and contexts. Keywords:

Combining protein sequences and structures with transformers and equivariant 
graph neural networks to predict protein function.

Boadu F, Cao H, Cheng J.

MOTIVATION: Millions of protein sequences have been generated by numerous genome 
and transcriptome sequencing projects. However, experimentally determining the 
function of the proteins is still a time consuming, low-throughput, and 
expensive process, leading to a large protein sequence-function gap. Therefore, 
it is important to develop computational methods to accurately predict protein 
function to fill the gap. Even though many methods have been developed to use 
protein sequences as input to predict function, much fewer methods leverage 
protein structures in protein function prediction because there was lack of 
accurate protein structures for most proteins until recently.
RESULTS: We developed TransFun - a method using a transformer-based protein 
language model and 3D-equivariant graph neural networks to distill information 
from both protein sequences and structures to predict protein function. It 
extracts feature embeddings from protein sequences using a pre-trained protein 
language model (ESM) via transfer learning and combines them with 3D structures 
of proteins predicted by AlphaFold2 through equivariant graph neural networks. 
Benchmarked on the CAFA3 test dataset and a new test dataset, TransFun 
outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, indicating the language model and 
3D-equivariant graph neural networks are effective methods to leverage protein 
sequences and structures to improve protein function prediction. Combining 
TransFun predictions and sequence similarity-based predictions can further 
increase prediction accuracy.

    J Psychiatr Res. 2023 May;161:1.

BACKGROUND: Previous research has shown the relationship between loneliness and 
affect, as well as the relationship between trait loneliness and state 
loneliness. However, none has investigated how social context affects the 
association between loneliness and affect. The current study aims to examine the 
association between trait loneliness, state loneliness and momentary affects in 
different social contexts.
METHODS: Participants aged 15-24 were randomly recruited from a Hong Kong 
epidemiological study to participate in an Experience Sampling Method (ESM) 
study. The group was divided in two based on the mean trait loneliness score 
(UCLA Loneliness Scale) at baseline. State loneliness, momentary positive (PA) 
and negative affect (NA) and social context were assessed using ESM. Multilevel 
logistic regression was used to analyze the association between momentary 
affect, state loneliness and trait loneliness in various social contexts.
RESULTS: HL (high lonely) and LL (low lonely) groups consisted of 79 
participants (44.6%) and 98 participants (55.4%) respectively. HL group had 
lower PA and higher NA, as well as a higher state loneliness than LL group. HL 
group had a lower state loneliness when being with intimate company compared to 
alone. LL group only had a higher PA when being with intimate company compared 
to non-intimate company and alone respectively.
CONCLUSION: Adolescents with high level of trait loneliness experienced higher 
PA, momentary loneliness and lower NA compared to those with low level of trait 
loneliness. The quality of social company is crucial in allowing one to 
experience different degrees of PA and momentary loneliness.

Alpha Tocopherol Loaded Polymeric Nanoparticles: Preparation, Characterizations, 
and In Vitro Assessments Against Oxidative Stress in Spinal Cord Injury 
Treatment.

Laliwala A(1), Daverey A(2), Agrawal SK(2), Dash AK(3).

Spinal cord injury (SCI) is characterized by mechanical injury or trauma to the 
spinal cord. Currently, SCI treatment requires extremely high doses of 
neuroprotective agents, which in turn, causes several adverse effects. To 
overcome these limitations, the present study focuses on delivery of a low but 
effective dose of a naturally occurring antioxidant, α-tocopherol (α-TP). 
Calcium alginate nanoparticles (CA-NP) and poly D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid 
nanoparticles (PLGA-NP) prepared by ionotropic gelation and solvent evaporation 
technique had particle size of 21.9 ± 11.19 and 152.4 ± 10.6 nm, respectively. 
Surface morphology, surface charge, as well as particle size distribution of 
both nanoparticles were evaluated. Entrapment of α-TP into CA-NP and PLGA-NP 
quantified by UPLC showed entrapment efficiency of 4.00 ± 1.63% and 
76.6 ± 11.4%, respectively. In vitro cytotoxicity profiles on human 
astrocyte-spinal cord (HA-sp) showed that blank CA-NP at high concentrations 
reduced the cell viability whereas blank PLGA-NP showed relatively safer 
cytotoxic profiles. In addition, PLGA nanoparticles encapsulated with α-TP 
(α-TP-PLGA-NP) in comparison to α-TP alone at high concentrations were less 
toxic. Pretreatment of HA-sp cells with α-TP-PLGA-NP showed two-fold higher 
anti-oxidative protection as compared to α-TP alone, when oxidative stress was 
induced by H2O2. In conclusion, CA-NP were found to be unsuitable for treatment 
of SCI due to their cytotoxicity. Comparatively, α-TP-PLGA-NP were safer and 
showed high degree of protection against oxidative stress than α-TP alone.

Functional analysis of ascP in Aeromonas veronii TH0426 reveals a key role in 
the regulation of virulence.

Guan Y(1), Zhang M(1), Wang Y(1), Liu Z(1), Zhao Z(1), Wang H(1), An D(1), Qian 
A(1), Kang Y(1), Sun W(2), Shan X(3).

Aeromonas veronii is a pathogen which can induce diseases in humans, animals and 
aquatic organisms, but its pathogenic mechanism and virulence factors are still 
elusive. In this study, we successfully constructed a mutant strain (ΔascP) by 
homologous recombination. The results showed that the deletion of the ascP gene 
significantly down-regulated the expression of associated effector proteins in 
A. veronii compared to its wild type. The adhesive and invasive abilities of 
ΔascP to EPC cells were 0.82-fold lower in contrast to the wild strain. The 
toxicity of ΔascP to cells was decreased by about 2.91-fold (1 h) and 1.74-fold 
(2 h). Furthermore, the LD50 of the mutant strain of crucian carp was reduced by 
19.94-fold, and the virulence was considerably attenuated. In contrast to the 
wild strain, the ΔascP content in the liver and spleen was considerably lower. 
The titers of serum cytokines (IL-8, TNF-α, and IL-1β) in crucian carp after the 
infection of the ΔascP strain were considerably lower in contrast to the wild 
strain. Hence, the ascP gene is essential for the etiopathogenesis of A. veronii 
TH0426.

Identification and molecular mechanisms of novel antioxidant peptides from two 
sources of eggshell membrane hydrolysates showing cytoprotection against 
oxidative stress: A combined in silico and in vitro study.

Zhu L(1), Xiong H(1), Huang X(1), Guyonnet V(2), Ma M(3), Chen X(4), Zheng Y(4), 
Wang L(4), Hu G(1).

Eggshell membranes (ESM) from fresh and hatched chicken eggs are important 
agricultural byproducts. In this study, we investigated the antioxidant and 
cytoprotective activity of hydrolysates from fresh and hatched ESM, identified 
the antioxidant peptides and explored their potential molecular mechanism using 
a combined in silico and in vitro approach. The results showed that the 
hydrolysates fractions (MW < 3 kDa) of both ESM exhibited excellent antioxidant 
effects and could protect H2O2-induced RAW264.7 cells by reducing ROS and MDA 
levels involving the modulation of the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway. Six novel peptides 
identified by integrated approaches of peptidomics and in silico bioinformatic 
analysis were synthesized, exhibiting significantly higher ORAC values 
(629.41-1823.77 µmol TE/mmol) than GSH (397.21 µmol TE/mmol). Among these, 
KPLCPP, MDGWPR, and LWNPR possessed stronger ABTS scavenging and cytoprotective 
activities than GSH. All the six peptides could dock onto the Keap1-Kelch 
domain. Moreover, KPLCPP and LWNPR could regulate the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway and 
induced the overexpression of antioxidant enzymes including HO-1, SOD and 
GSH-Px. With the molecular docking and western blot analysis, the underlying 
molecular mechanism of the ESM antioxidant peptides might be related to the 
activation of Keap1-Nrf2 pathway by occupying the Nrf2-binding site on Keap1. 
This study provides a theoretical basis for the application of fresh and hatched 
ESM antioxidant peptides in functional foods, as well as insights for the 
identification and the mechanisms research of more food-derived antioxidant 
peptides.

SOCS3 Silencing Promotes Activation of Vocal Fold Fibroblasts via JAK2/STAT3 
Signaling Pathway.

Li X(1), Hu R(1), Wang H(1), Xu W(2).

Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) is a negative regulatory protein that 
has been identified as a key inhibitory regulator of JAK/STAT signaling pathway. 
However, the mutual regulatory relationship between SOCS3 and JAK2/STAT3 
signaling pathway after vocal fold injury remains unclear. In this study, we 
used small interfering RNA (siRNA) to investigate the mechanism of SOCS3 
regulating of fibroblasts through JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway after vocal fold 
injury. Our data shows that SOCS3 silencing promotes the transformation of 
normal vocal fold fibroblasts (VFFs) into an fibrotic phenotype and activates 
the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. JAK2 silencing significantly inhibits the 
increase in type I collagen and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) secretion in VFFs 
induced by TGF-β but has no significant effect on normal VFFs. The silencing of 
SOCS3 and JAK2 reverses the fibrotic phenotype of VFFs induced by SOCS3 
silencing. Therefore, we suggest that SOCS3 can affect the activation of vocal 
fold fibroblasts by regulating the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway after vocal fold 
injury. It provides a new insight for promoting the repair of vocal fold injury 
and preventing the formation of fibrosis.

Abrupt loss and uncertain recovery from fires of Amazon forests under low 
climate mitigation scenarios.

Cano IM(1), Shevliakova E(2), Malyshev S(2), John JG(2)(3), Yu Y(4), Smith 
B(5)(6), Pacala SW(1).

Tropical forests contribute a major sink for anthropogenic carbon emissions 
essential to slowing down the buildup of atmospheric CO2 and buffering climate 
change impacts. However, the response of tropical forests to more frequent 
weather extremes and long-recovery disturbances like fires remains uncertain. 
Analyses of field data and ecological theory raise concerns about the 
possibility of the Amazon crossing a tipping point leading to catastrophic 
tropical forest loss. In contrast, climate models consistently project an 
enhanced tropical sink. Here, we show a heterogeneous response of Amazonian 
carbon stocks in GFDL-ESM4.1, an Earth System Model (ESM) featuring dynamic 
disturbances and height-structured tree-grass competition. Enhanced productivity 
due to CO2 fertilization promotes increases in forest biomass that, under low 
emission scenarios, last until the end of the century. Under high emissions, 
positive trends reverse after 2060, when simulated fires prompt forest loss that 
results in a 40% decline in tropical forest biomass by 2100. Projected fires 
occur under dry conditions associated with El Niño Southern Oscillation and the 
Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, a response observed under current climate 
conditions, but exacerbated by an overall decline in precipitation. Following 
the initial disturbance, grassland dominance promotes recurrent fires and tree 
competitive exclusion, which prevents forest recovery. EC-Earth3-Veg, an ESM 
with a dynamic vegetation model of similar complexity, projected comparable 
wildfire forest loss under high emissions but faster postfire recovery rates. 
Our results reveal the importance of complex nonlinear responses to assessing 
climate change impacts and the urgent need to research postfire recovery and its 
representation in ESMs.

Alpha-Cypermethrin Resistance in Musca domestica: Resistance Instability, 
Realized Heritability, Risk Assessment, and Insecticide Cross-Resistance.

Abbas N(1), Hafez AM(1).

Musca domestica L., the common house fly, is a cosmopolitan carrier of human and 
livestock disease pathogens. The species exhibits resistance to many 
insecticides; therefore, effective M. domestica insecticide resistance 
management programs are required worldwide. In the present study, the 
development of alpha-cypermethrin resistance, realized heritability (h2), 
instability of resistance trait (DR), and cross-resistance (CR) was investigated 
in an alpha-cypermethrin-selected M. domestica strain (Alpha-Sel) across 24 
generations (Gs). Compared with an alpha-cypermethrin-unselected strain 
(Alpha-Unsel), resistance to alpha-cypermethrin increased from 46.4-fold (G5) to 
474.2-fold (G24) in Alpha-Sel females and 41.0-fold (G5) to 253.2-fold (G24) in 
Alpha-Sel males. Alpha-cypermethrin resistance declined by between -0.10 (G5) 
and -0.05 (G24) in both M. domestica sexes without insecticide exposure for 24 
generations. The h2 of alpha-cypermethrin resistance was 0.17 and 0.18 for males 
and females, respectively, in G1-G24. With selection intensities of 10-90%, the 
G values required for a tenfold increase in the LC50 of alpha-cypermethrin were 
6.3-53.7, 4.1-33.8, and 3.0-24.7, given h2 values of 0.17, 0.27, and 0.37, 
respectively, and a constant slope of 2.1 for males and h2 values of 0.18, 0.28, 
and 0.38, respectively, and a constant slope of 2.0 for females. Compared with 
Alpha-Unsel, Alpha-Sel M. domestica exhibited moderate CR to bifenthrin 
(15.5-fold), deltamethrin (28.4-fold), and cyfluthrin (16.8-fold), low CR to two 
pyrethroids and five organophosphates, and no CR to insect growth regulators. 
The instability of resistance trait, low h2, and absent or low CR associated 
with alpha-cypermethrin resistance in M. domestica indicate resistance could be 
managed with rotational use of the insecticide.

A Gated Recurrent Unit based architecture for recognizing ontology concepts from 
biological literature.

Devkota P(1), Mohanty SD(2), Manda P(3).

BACKGROUND: Annotating scientific literature with ontology concepts is a 
critical task in biology and several other domains for knowledge discovery. 
Ontology based annotations can power large-scale comparative analyses in a wide 
range of applications ranging from evolutionary phenotypes to rare human 
diseases to the study of protein functions. Computational methods that can tag 
scientific text with ontology terms have included lexical/syntactic methods, 
traditional machine learning, and most recently, deep learning.
RESULTS: Here, we present state of the art deep learning architectures based on 
Gated Recurrent Units for annotating text with ontology concepts. We use the 
Colorado Richly Annotated Full Text Corpus (CRAFT) as a gold standard for 
training and testing. We explore a number of additional information sources 
including NCBI's BioThesauraus and Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) to 
augment information from CRAFT for increasing prediction accuracy. Our best 
model results in a 0.84 F1 and semantic similarity.
CONCLUSION: The results shown here underscore the impact for using deep learning 
architectures for automatically recognizing ontology concepts from literature. 
The augmentation of the models with biological information beyond that present 
in the gold standard corpus shows a distinct improvement in prediction accuracy.

Comparative Analysis on Alignment-Based and Pretrained Feature Representations 
for the Identification of DNA-Binding Proteins.

Chen D(1), Zhang H(1), Chen Z(1), Xie B(1), Wang Y(1).

The interaction between DNA and protein is vital for the development of a living 
body. Previous numerous studies on in silico identification of DNA-binding 
proteins (DBPs) usually include features extracted from the alignment-based 
(pseudo) position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM), leading to limited application 
due to its time-consuming generation. Few researchers have paid attention to the 
application of pretrained language models at the scale of evolution to the 
identification of DBPs. To this end, we present comprehensive insights into a 
comparison study on alignment-based PSSM and pretrained evolutionary scale 
modeling (ESM) representations in the field of DBP classification. The 
comparison is conducted by extracting information from PSSM and ESM 
representations using four unified averaging operations and by performing 
various feature selection (FS) methods. Experimental results demonstrate that 
the pretrained ESM representation outperforms the PSSM-derived features in a 
fair comparison perspective. The pretrained feature presentation deserves wide 
application to the area of in silico DBP identification as well as other 
function annotation issues. Finally, it is also confirmed that an ensemble 
scheme by aggregating various trained FS models can significantly improve the 
classification performance of DBPs.

Automatic Generation of SBML Kinetic Models from Natural Language Texts Using 
GPT.

Maeda K(1), Kurata H(1).

Kinetic modeling is an essential tool in systems biology research, enabling the 
quantitative analysis of biological systems and predicting their behavior. 
However, the development of kinetic models is a complex and time-consuming 
process. In this article, we propose a novel approach called KinModGPT, which 
generates kinetic models directly from natural language text. KinModGPT employs 
GPT as a natural language interpreter and Tellurium as an SBML generator. We 
demonstrate the effectiveness of KinModGPT in creating SBML kinetic models from 
complex natural language descriptions of biochemical reactions. KinModGPT 
successfully generates valid SBML models from a range of natural language model 
descriptions of metabolic pathways, protein-protein interaction networks, and 
heat shock response. This article demonstrates the potential of KinModGPT in 
kinetic modeling automation.

Computational and SAXS-based structure insights of pectin acetyl esterase 
(CtPae12B) of family 12 carbohydrate esterase from Clostridium thermocellum ATCC 
27405.

Ahmed J(1), Kumar K(1), Sharma K(1)(2), Fontes CMGA(3)(4), Goyal A(1).

Pectin is a complex form of polysaccharide and is composed of several structural 
components that require the concerted action of several pectinases for its 
complete degradation. In this study, in silico and solution structure of a 
pectin acetyl esterase (CtPae12B) of family 12 carbohydrate esterase (CE12) from 
Clostridium thermocellum was determined. The CtPae12B modelled structure, showed 
a new α/β hydrolase fold, similar to the fold found in the crystal structures of 
its nearest homologues from CE12 family, which differed from α/β hydrolase fold 
found in glycoside hydrolases. In the active site of CtPae12B, two loops (loop1 
and loop6) play an important role in the formation of a catalytic triad 
Ser15-Asp187-His190, where Ser15 acts as a nucleophile. The structural stability 
of CtPae12B and its catalytic site was detected by performing molecular dynamic 
(MD) simulation which showed stable and compact conformation of the structure. 
Molecular docking method was employed to analyse the conformations of various 
suitable ligands docked at the active site of CtPae12B. The stability and 
structural specificity of the catalytic residues with the ligand, 4-nitrophenyl 
acetate (4-NPA) was confirmed by MD simulation of CtPae12B-4NPA docked complex. 
Moreover, it was found that the nucleophile Ser15, forms hydrophobic interaction 
with 4-NPA in the active site to complete covalent catalysis. Small angle X-ray 
scattering analysis of CtPae12B at 3 mg/mL displayed elongated, compact and 
monodispersed nature in solution. The ab initio derived dummy model showed that 
CtPae12B exists as a homotrimer at 3 mg/mL which was also confirmed by dynamic 
light scattering.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

INTRODUCTION: To measure the level of endothelial cell-specific molecule-1 
(ESM-1) expression among the Renal Cell Cancer (RCC) variants using by 
immunohistochemical method and determine the relationship between ESM-1 
expression and RCC prognosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: ESM-1 immunoreactivity scores (IR) were measured in 
appropriate renal tumoral tissue blocks of 153 consecutive RCC patients in this 
retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. Mean ESM-1 IR scores 
were calculated in patients who were pathologically diagnosed with clear cell 
RCC (ccRCC), papillary RCC (pRCC), and chromophobe RCC (chRCC). Progression-free 
survival and overall survival were evaluated using the log-rank test according 
to ESM-1 IR scores. Survival rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier survival 
analysis.
RESULTS: In the ccRCC group, the mean ESM-1 IR scores of those with local 
invasion were significantly higher than those without local invasion 
(P = 0.014). The mean ESM-1 IR score of patients with metastatic ccRCC was 
significantly higher than those with non-metastatic ccRCC (P < 0.001). 
Considering all patients regardless of RCC subtype pathologies, the mean ESM-1 
IR score in clinical stage 1 tumor was 3.82 ± 1.98, 4.87 ± 1.74 in clinical 
stage 2, 5.88 ± 2 in clinical stage 3, and 6.60 ± 2.23 in clinical stage 4. The 
mean ESM-1 IR score of patients with metastatic ccRCC was significantly higher 
than those with non-metastatic ccRCC (P < 0.001). The mean follow-up period for 
all patients in this study was 71 months (range 1-120 months). It has been shown 
that the higher the ESM-1 IR score, the lower the 10-year overall survival and 
disease-free survival rates (P = 0.026, P = 0.005).
CONCLUSION: Immunohistochemical expression of ESM-1 may be a promising 
prognostic biomarker in RCC. Currently, some prognostic scoring systems are 
available for patients with localized and metastasized RCC. Incorporating ESM-1 
expression in RCC into these existing prognostic scoring systems could improve 
these models and enhance the quality of individual oncologic management in RCC 
patients.

Formalizing Invertebrate Morphological Data: A Descriptive Model for 
Cuticle-Based Skeleto-Muscular Systems, an Ontology for Insect Anatomy, and 
their Potential Applications in Biodiversity Research and Informatics.

AD(1), Koch M(6), Boudinot BE(7)(8), Bouchard P(9), Burks R(10), Vogt L(11), 
Yoder M(12), Osumi-Sutherland D(13), Friedrich F(14), Beutel R(8), Mikó I(15).

The spectacular radiation of insects has produced a stunning diversity of 
phenotypes. During the past 250 years, research on insect systematics has 
generated hundreds of terms for naming and comparing them. In its current form, 
this terminological diversity is presented in natural language and lacks 
formalization, which prohibits computer-assisted comparison using semantic web 
technologies. Here we propose a Model for Describing Cuticular Anatomical 
Structures (MoDCAS) which incorporates structural properties and positional 
relationships for standardized, consistent, and reproducible descriptions of 
arthropod phenotypes. We applied the MoDCAS framework in creating the ontology 
for the Anatomy of the Insect Skeleto-Muscular system (AISM). The AISM is the 
first general insect ontology that aims to cover all taxa by providing 
generalized, fully logical, and queryable, definitions for each term. It was 
built using the Ontology Development Kit (ODK), which maximizes interoperability 
with Uberon (Uberon multi-species anatomy ontology) and other basic ontologies, 
enhancing the integration of insect anatomy into the broader biological 
sciences. A template system for adding new terms, extending, and linking the 
AISM to additional anatomical, phenotypic, genetic, and chemical ontologies is 
also introduced. The AISM is proposed as the backbone for taxon-specific insect 
ontologies and has potential applications spanning systematic biology and 
biodiversity informatics, allowing users to (1) use controlled vocabularies and 
create semi-automated computer-parsable insect morphological descriptions; (2) 
integrate insect morphology into broader fields of research, including 
ontology-informed phylogenetic methods, logical homology hypothesis testing, 
evo-devo studies, and genotype to phenotype mapping; and (3) automate the 
extraction of morphological data from the literature, enabling the generation of 
large-scale phenomic data, by facilitating the production and testing of 
informatic tools able to extract, link, annotate, and process morphological 
data. This descriptive model and its ontological applications will allow for 
clear and semantically interoperable integration of arthropod phenotypes in 
biodiversity studies.

This study aimed to examine the validity of urinary N-terminal titin 
fragment/creatinine (urinary N-titin/Cr) reflecting muscle damage biomarker in 
patients with interstitial lung disease. This retrospective study enrolled 
patients with interstitial lung disease. We measured urinary N-titin/Cr. 
Furthermore, we measured the cross-sectional areas of the pectoralis muscles 
above the aortic arch (PMCSA) and erector spinae muscles of the 12th thoracic 
vertebra muscles (ESMCSA) to assess muscle mass until 1 year. We examined the 
correlation between urinary N-titin/Cr and the change in muscle mass. We plotted 
receiver operating characteristic curves to estimate the cut-off points for 
urinary N-titin/Cr for distinguishing the greater-than-median and 
smaller-than-median reduction of muscle mass after 1 year. We enrolled 68 
patients with interstitial lung disease. The median urinary N-titin/Cr value was 
7.0 pmol/mg/dL. We observed significant negative correlations between urinary 
N-titin/Cr and changes in the PMCSA after 1 year (p < 0.001) and changes in the 
ESMCSA after 6 months (p < 0.001) and 1 year (p < 0.001). The cut-off points for 
urinary N-titin/Cr were 5.2 pmol/mg/dL and 10.4 pmol/mg/dL in the PMCSA and 
ESMCSA, respectively. In summary, urinary N-titin/Cr may predict muscle loss in 
the long-term and act as a clinically useful biomarker reflecting muscle damage.

Glucocorticoid Dose Dependency on Gene Expression in Vocal Fold Fibroblasts and 
Macrophages.

Nakamura R(1), Bing R(1), Gartling GJ(1), Garabedian MJ(2), Branski RC(1)(3).

OBJECTIVE: Glucocorticoids (GCs) modulate multiple cellular activities including 
inflammatory and fibrotic responses. Outcomes of GC treatment for laryngeal 
disease vary, affording opportunity to optimize treatment. In the current study, 
three clinically employed GCs were evaluated to identify optimal in vitro 
concentrations at which GCs mediate favorable anti-inflammatory and fibrotic 
effects in multiple cell types. We hypothesize a therapeutic window will emerge 
as a foundation for optimized therapeutic strategies for patients with laryngeal 
disease.
STUDY DESIGN: In vitro.
METHODS: Human vocal fold fibroblasts and human macrophages derived from THP-1 
monocytes were treated with 0.03-1000 nM dexamethasone, 0.3-10,000 nM 
methylprednisolone, and 0.3-10,000 nM triamcinolone in combination with 
interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, or interleukin-4. Real-time polymerase 
chain reaction was performed to analyze inflammatory (CXCL10, CXCl11, PTGS2, 
TNF, IL1B) and fibrotic (CCN2, LOX, TGM2) genes, and TSC22D3, a target gene of 
GC signaling. EC50 and IC50 to alter inflammatory and fibrotic gene expression 
was calculated.
RESULTS: Interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α increased inflammatory gene 
expression in both cell types; this response was reduced by GCs. Interleukin-4 
increased LOX and TGM2 expression in macrophages; this response was also reduced 
by GCs. GCs induced TSC22D3 and CCN2 expression independent of cytokine 
treatment. EC50 for each GC to upregulate CCN2 was higher than the IC50 to 
downregulate other genes.
CONCLUSION: Lower concentrations of GCs repressed inflammatory gene expression 
and only moderately induced genes involved in fibrosis. These data warrant 
consideration as a foundation for optimized clinical care paradigms to reduce 
inflammation and mitigate fibrosis.

Saliva proteomic profile of early childhood caries and caries-free children.

Oliveira BP(1), Buzalaf MAR(2), Silva NC(1), Ventura TMO(2), Toniolo J(1), 
Rodrigues JA(1).

OBJECTIVE: Saliva plays an important antimicrobial role and it is related to the 
pathogenesis of early childhood caries (ECC). The aim of this study was to 
compare the proteomic profile of unstimulated saliva of children aged 3-5 years 
who had ECC and caries-free (CF) children.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: After the saliva collection from 20 children (ECC: 
n = 10; CF: n = 10), the samples were processed for proteomic analysis on a mass 
spectrometer.
RESULTS: 1638 proteins were identified, of which 355 were present in both 
groups. A total of 579 proteins were exclusively identified in the CF group and 
included Leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein, Protein S100-A5, Protein S100-A8 and 
Mucin-2. Moreover, 704 proteins were exclusively identified in the ECC group, 
including Enamelin. The differential expression analysis revealed that 112 
proteins were up-regulated in the CF group. Among these proteins, we highlighted 
Hemoglobin subunit gamma-1 (343-fold increase), gamma-2 (336-fold increase) and 
alpha (40-fold increase).
CONCLUSIONS: The proteomic profile of the saliva varied substantially between 
the groups. Hemoglobin subunit gamma-1, gamma-2 and alpha may play a protective 
role in children with ECC. These proteins should be evaluated in future studies, 
because they may be possible good candidates to be included in anti-caries 
dental products.

Investigation of momentary negative symptoms in patients with early psychosis in 
daily life: An experience sampling study.

Fung VSC(1), Chan JCY(1), Wong SCY(1), Wong CSM(2), Kirtley O(3), Myin-Germeys 
I(3), Strauss GP(4), Chang WC(5).

Negative symptoms are a key therapeutic target in promoting functional recovery 
in early psychosis intervention, but momentary negative symptom manifestations 
remain understudied in the early stage of illness. We employed an 
experience-sampling methodology (ESM) to evaluate momentary affective 
experiences, hedonic capacity for an event recalled, current activities and 
social interactions, and associated appraisals for 6 consecutive days in 33 
clinically-stable early psychosis patients (within 3 years of treatment for 
first-episode psychosis) and 35 demographically-matched healthy controls. 
Adjusted multilevel linear-mixed models revealed higher intensity and 
variability of negative affect in patients than controls, but no group 
difference in affect instability as well as positive affect intensity and 
variability. Patients demonstrated no significantly greater anhedonia for event, 
activity or social interactions relative to controls. Higher preference for 
company (when alone) and to be alone (when in company) was observed in patients 
than controls. No significant group difference in pleasantness to be alone or 
proportion of time being alone. Our results indicate no evidence for blunting of 
affective experiences, anhedonia (social and non-social) and asociality in early 
psychosis. Future research complementing ESM with multiple digital phenotyping 
measures will facilitate more refined negative symptom assessment in the daily 
life of patients with early psychosis.

Effect of Sitophilus zeamais (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) Infestation on the 
Protein Physicochemical and Structural Properties of Wheat Grain.

Wu Q(1), Tian Q(1), Zhang D(1), Zhang Y(1).

Boring pests such as Sitophilus zeamais (S. zeamais) are major threats in grain 
storage. However, how these pests affect the proteins of stored grains remains 
largely unknown. Here we aimed to investigate the effect of S. zeamais 
infestation on wheat protein during postharvest storage. In this study, wheat 
grain infested by S. zeamais was sampled at egg (4 d), larval (20 d), pupal (35 
d), and adult stages (45 d), respectively. The protein's physicochemical and 
structural properties and the edible quality of whole wheat noodle were 
analyzed. The results showed that S. zeamais infestation significantly decreased 
the quality of wheat protein by altering its constitution and structure 
properties. Especially, compared with the control, the content of wet and dry 
gluten, gluten index, sodium dodecyl sulfate sedimentation volume, sulfhydryl 
groups, and disulfide bonds in insect-infested wheat decreased by 19.40, 5.42, 
18.40, 8.12, 29.13, and 14.30%, respectively, during the storage period of one 
life cycle of S. zeamais. Additionally, the proportions of wheat protein 
fractions (albumin [1.16-fold], globulin [0.96-fold], gliadin [1.16-fold], and 
glutenin [0.95-fold]) and secondary structures (α-helix [0.91-fold], β-fold 
[0.96-fold], β-turn [1.06-fold], and random coil [1.05-fold]) of protein changed 
significantly, and the gluten network structure was broken in S. 
zeamais-infested wheat. Furthermore, the color of whole wheat noodle became 
darker, cooking loss rate increased, and textural properties (hardness, 
adhesiveness, springiness, cohesiveness, chewiness, and resilience) decreased as 
well. The results in the present study provided new insights for analyzing the 
quality deterioration mechanism and further quality improvement of boring 
pests-infested wheat grain.

Reframing prosegment-dependent folding and limits on natural protein folding 
landscapes from an evolutionary perspective.

Sanders AD(1), Dee DR(1), Yada RY(1).

In this perspective, we propose that the folding energy landscapes of model 
proteases including pepsin and alpha-lytic protease (αLP), which lack 
thermodynamic stability and fold on the order of months to millennia, 
respectively, should be viewed as not evolved and fundamentally distinct from 
their extended zymogen forms. These proteases have evolved to fold with 
prosegment domains and robustly self-assemble as expected. In this manner, 
general protein folding principles are strengthened. In support of our view, αLP 
and pepsin exhibit hallmarks of frustration associated with unevolved folding 
landscapes, such as non-cooperativity, memory effects, and substantial kinetic 
trapping. The evolutionary implications of this folding strategy are considered 
in detail. Direct applications of this folding strategy on enzyme design, 
finding new drug targets, and constructing tunable folding landscapes are also 
discussed. Together with certain proteases, growing examples of other folding 
"exceptions"-including protein fold switching, functional misfolding, and 
prevalent inability to refold-suggests a paradigm shift in which proteins may 
evolve to exist in a wide range of energy landscapes and structures 
traditionally thought to be avoided in nature.

Identification and Mutation Analysis of Nonconserved Residues on the TIM-Barrel 
Surface of GH5_5 Cellulases for Catalytic Efficiency and Stability Improvement.

Zheng J(#)(1)(2), Liu HQ(#)(3), Qin X(1), Yang K(1), Tian J(3), Wang XL(1), Wang 
YR(1), Wang Y(1), Yao B(1), Luo HY(1), Huang HQ(1).

Exploring the potential functions of nonconserved residues on the outer side of 
α-helices and systematically optimizing them are pivotal for their application 
in protein engineering. Based on the evolutionary structural conservation 
analysis of GH5_5 cellulases, a practical molecular improvement strategy was 
developed. Highly variable sites on the outer side of the α-helices of the GH5_5 
cellulase from Aspergillus niger (AnCel5A) were screened, and 14 out of the 34 
highly variable sites were confirmed to exert a positive effect on the activity. 
After the modular combination of the positive mutations, the catalytic 
efficiency of the mutants was further improved. By using CMC-Na as the 
substrate, the catalytic efficiency and specific activity of variant 
AnCel5A_N193A/T300P/D307P were approximately 2.0-fold that of AnCel5A (227 ± 21 
versus 451 ± 43 ml/s/mg and 1,726 ± 19 versus 3,472 ± 42 U/mg, respectively). 
The half-life (t1/2) of variant AnCel5A_N193A/T300P/D307P at 75°C was 2.36 times 
that of AnCel5A. The role of these sites was successfully validated in other 
GH5_5 cellulases. Computational analyses revealed that the flexibility of the 
loop 6-loop 7-loop 8 region was responsible for the increased catalytic 
performance. This work not only illustrated the important role of rapidly 
evolving positions on the outer side of the α-helices of GH5_5 cellulases but 
also revealed new insights into engineering the proteins that nature left as 
clues for us to find. IMPORTANCE A comprehensive understanding of the residues 
on the α-helices of the GH5_5 cellulases is important for catalytic efficiency 
and stability improvement. The main objective of this study was to use the 
evolutionary conservation and plasticity of the TIM-barrel fold to probe the 
relationship between nonconserved residues on the outer side of the α-helices 
and the catalytic efficiency of GH5_5 cellulases by conducting structure-guided 
protein engineering. By using a four-step nonconserved residue screening 
strategy, the functional role of nonconserved residues on the outer side of the 
α-helices was effectively identified, and a variant with superior performance 
and capability was constructed. Hence, this study proved the effectiveness of 
this strategy in engineering GH5_5 cellulases and provided a potential 
competitor for industrial applications. Furthermore, this study sheds new light 
on engineering TIM-barrel proteins.

A regional scale impact and uncertainty assessment of climate change in the 
Western Ghats in India.

Chandu N(1), Eldho TI(2)(3), Mondal A(1)(4).

The general circulation models (GCMs) and emission scenarios (RCP 4.5 and 8.5) 
have proven to be significantly functional in evaluating the impacts of climate 
change (CC) on hydrology, although their performance and accuracy varies on a 
regional scale. The objective of the present study is to evaluate the 
performance of five CMIP5 GCMs (CanESM2, BNU-ESM, CNRM-CM5, MPI-ESM-LR and 
MPI-ESM-MR) on a regional scale in the West Flowing River Basins-2 (WFRB-2) in 
India to model the impact of CC and its scenario uncertainty using reliability 
ensemble average (REA) method. For quantifying the results, the upper, middle 
and lower regions of WFRB-2 are separately analysed. The MPIMR and MPILR GCM 
model shows highest reliability factor range (0.3-0.6) in predicting the annual 
mean and annual maximum rainfall for most of the grids in the region. The 
GCM-simulated runoff using VIC (variable infiltration capacity) model is 
evaluated using statistical parameters such as root mean square error (RMSE), 
percentage bias (Pbias) and standard deviation (Std). The annual mean (maximum) 
runoff obtained using REA ensemble shows least RMSE, Pbias and Std values, i.e. 
21.08%, 9.10 mm and 8.9 mm (6%, 39.1 mm, 39.1 mm), respectively for the middle 
region, which demonstrates higher reliability of GCM outputs in the flood-prone 
regions of WFRB-2. Furthermore, the future projection of annual maximum 
rainfall/runoff shows an increase of 50 mm/15 mm in the near future (2011-2040) 
for lower and 20 mm/6 mm for middle regions, which may cause flooding activities 
in the lower and middle region of WFRB-2.

Juniper Berries Regulate Diabetes and Obesity Markers Through Modulating PPARα, 
PPARγ, and LXR: In Vitro and In Vivo Effects.

Chae HS(1), Dale O(1), Mir TM(1), Ashfaq MK(1), Avula B(1), Walker LA(1), Khan 
IA(1)(2), Khan SI(1)(2).

The berries of Juniperus communis have been traditionally used for therapeutic 
purposes. They have been reported to possess various pharmacological effects 
such as anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic activities. In this 
study, a methanolic extract of J. communis berries (JB) was evaluated for its 
effects on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors alpha and gamma (PPARα 
and PPARγ), liver X receptor (LXR), glucose uptake and lipid accumulation using 
various cellular systems. At a concentration of 25 μg/mL, JB caused 3.77-fold 
activation of PPARα, 10.90-fold activation of PPARγ, and 4.43-fold activation of 
LXR in hepatic cells. JB inhibited (11%) the adipogenic effect induced by 
rosiglitazone in adipocytes and increased glucose uptake (90%) in muscle cells. 
In high-fat diet (HFD) fed mice, JB at a dose of 25 mg/kg body weight exhibited 
a 21% decrease in body weight. Fasting glucose levels in mice treated with 
12.5 mg/kg of JB were significantly decreased (39%) indicating its efficacy in 
regulating hyperglycemia and obesity induced by HFD thus ameliorating the 
symptoms of type 2 diabetes. A series of energy metabolic genes, including Sirt1 
(2.00-fold) and RAF1 (2.04-fold), were upregulated by JB, while rosiglitazone 
regulated the hepatic PPARγ only. Phytochemical analysis of JB indicated 
presence of a number of flavonoids and biflavonoids which seem to be responsible 
for the observed activity. It was concluded that JB acted as a multiple agonist 
of PPARα, PPARγ and LXR without the undesired effect of adipogenesis and 
exhibited the property of enhancing glucose uptake. The regulation of PPARα, 
PPARγ and LXR seems to be through Sirt1 and RAF1. In vivo results confirmed the 
antidiabetic and antiobesity potential of JB and indicated its utility in 
metabolic disorder and type 2 diabetes.

Hatched Eggshell Membrane Can Be a Novel Source of Antioxidant Hydrolysates to 
Protect against H(2)O(2)-Induced Oxidative Stress in Human Chondrocytes.

Zhu L(1)(2), Ma M(1), Ahn DU(3), Guyonnet V(4), Wang L(2), Zheng Y(2), He Q(1), 
Xiong H(1), Huang X(1).

Natural antioxidants derived from agricultural by-products have great promise 
and ecological advantages in the treatment of oxidative stress-related diseases. 
The eggshell membrane (ESM) from hatched eggs, i.e., the hatched ESM, is a 
globally abundant agricultural byproduct, and its high-value utilization has 
been rarely studied compared to the well-studied ESM from fresh eggs. In this 
research, we systematically characterized the hatched ESM as a novel source of 
antioxidant hydrolysates and explored their potential role in H2O2-induced human 
chondrocytes. The results showed that the hatched ESM is a protein-rich fibrous 
mesh material with a significantly different structure and composition from 
those of fresh ESM. Enzymatic hydrolysis of hatched ESM can produce antioxidant 
hydrolysates rich in low molecular weight (MW) peptides, which mainly derived 
from the Lysyl oxidase homolog by Nano-LC-MS/MS analysis. The peptide fraction 
with MW < 3 kDa (HEMH-I) exhibited the highest DPPH radical scavenging, 
Fe2+-chelating, and Fe3+-reducing abilities. In H2O2-induced human SW1353 
chondrocytes, HEMH-I treatment significantly increased the cell viability and 
ameliorated oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and cartilage matrix 
degradation by reducing the level of ROS, matrix metalloprotease 3 (MMP3), 
MMP13, and IL-6, and by promoting the expression of SOD and type II collagen, 
potentially through activating the cellular Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. This study 
provides a theoretical basis for the value-added application of hatched ESM 
waste to produce antioxidant hydrolysates and indicates their potential as 
functional food and pharmaceuticals.

Low-level laser therapy, piezocision, or their combination vs. conventional 
treatment for orthodontic tooth movement : A hierarchical 6-arm split-mouth 
randomized clinical trial.

[Article in English]

Moradinejad M(1), Chaharmahali R(2), Shamohammadi M(1)(3), Mir M(4)(5), Rakhshan 
V(6).

PURPOSE: The use non-invasive or minimally invasive methods to accelerate 
orthodontic tooth movements (OTM) is desirable. In this regard, low-level laser 
therapy (LLLT, photobiomodulation) and piezocision are suggested. However, 
because the efficacies of these methods remain controversial/inconclusive, we 
investigated and compared these two methods.
METHODS: Sixty-four quadrants in 32 patients were randomized into three parallel 
intervention groups of 22, 22, and 20 (6 parallel arms, n = 64 treatment/control 
sides). Bilateral first premolars were extracted and canine retraction 
commenced. In each group, one side of the mouth was randomly selected as 
control, while the other side underwent each of three interventions: LLLT 
(940 nm, 8 J, 0.5 W, 16 s, 12 sites), piezocision, and "LLLT + piezocision". At 
the 3rd, 6th, and 9th follow-up weeks, canine retraction and anchorage loss were 
measured. Data were analyzed statistically (α = 0.05).
RESULTS: After 9 weeks, LLLT, piezocision, and LLLT + piezocision improved 
canine retraction by 0.51, 1.14, and 1.93 mm, respectively. LLLT accelerated 
canine retraction (compared to control) by 1.6-, 1.4-, and 1.2-fold in the 3rd, 
6th, and 9th week, respectively. These statistics were 2.1-, 1.7-, and 1.5-fold 
for piezocision and 2.7-, 2.1-, and 1.8-fold for LLLT + piezocision. Compared to 
controls, each intervention showed significant retraction acceleration 
(p < 0.05). The effect of LLLT + piezocision was greater than that of isolated 
piezocision (p < 0.05), which itself was greater than that for isolated LLLT 
(p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: All three methods accelerated OTM, with the combination of 
LLLT + piezocision producing the strongest and LLLT producing the weakest 
acceleration.

Publisher: ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: ZIELSETZUNG: Die Anwendung nichtinvasiver oder 
minimal-invasiver Methoden zur Beschleunigung kieferorthopädischer 
Zahnbewegungen (OTM) ist wünschenswert. In diesem Kontext werden die 
Low-Level-Lasertherapie (LLLT, Photobiomodulation) und die Piezozision 
vorgeschlagen. Da die Wirksamkeit dieser Methoden jedoch nach wie vor umstritten 
bzw. nicht eindeutig ist, haben wir diese beiden Methoden untersucht und 
verglichen.
METHODEN: Vierundsechzig Quadranten von 32 Patienten wurden nach dem 
Zufallsprinzip in 3 parallele Interventionsgruppen von 22, 22 und 20 
(6 parallele Arme, n = 64 Behandlungs‑/Kontrollseiten) eingeteilt. Die 
bilateralen ersten Prämolaren wurden entfernt, die Eckzahnretraktion wurde 
eingeleitet. In jeder Gruppe wurde eine Seite des Mundes nach dem Zufallsprinzip 
als Kontrolle ausgewählt, während die andere Seite jeweils einer der 3 
Behandlungsmethoden unterzogen wurde: LLLT (940 nm, 8 J, 0,5 W, 16 s, 
12 Stellen), Piezozision und „LLLT + Piezozision“. In der 3., 6. und 
9. Nachuntersuchungswoche wurden Eckzahnretraktion und Verankerungsverlust 
ermittelt. Die Daten wurden statistisch ausgewertet (α = 0,05).
ERGEBNISSE: Nach 9 Wochen verbesserten LLLT, Piezozision und LLLT + Piezozision 
die Eckzahnretraktion um 0,51, 1,14 bzw. 1,93 mm. LLLT beschleunigte die 
Eckzahnretraktion (im Vergleich zur Kontrolle) in der 3., 6. und 9. Woche um das 
1,6-, 1,4- bzw. 1,2-fache. Diese Werte waren 2,1-, 1,7- und 1,5-fach für die 
Piezozision und 2,7-, 2,1- und 1,8-fach für LLLT + Piezozision. Im Vergleich zu 
den Kontrollen zeigte jeder Eingriff eine signifikante Beschleunigung der 
Retraktion (p < 0,05). Die Wirkung von LLLT + Piezozision war größer als die der 
isolierten Piezozision (p < 0,05), die wiederum größer war als die der 
isolierten LLLT (p < 0,05).
SCHLUSSFOLGERUNG: Alle 3 Behandlungsverfahren beschleunigten die OTM, die 
Kombination von LLLT + Piezozision am stärksten, die LLLT am wenigsten.

DeepHomo2.0: improved protein-protein contact prediction of homodimers by 
transformer-enhanced deep learning.

Lin P(1), Yan Y(1), Huang SY(1).

Protein-protein interactions play an important role in many biological 
processes. However, although structure prediction for monomer proteins has 
achieved great progress with the advent of advanced deep learning algorithms 
like AlphaFold, the structure prediction for protein-protein complexes remains 
an open question. Taking advantage of the Transformer model of ESM-MSA, we have 
developed a deep learning-based model, named DeepHomo2.0, to predict 
protein-protein interactions of homodimeric complexes by leveraging the 
direct-coupling analysis (DCA) and Transformer features of sequences and the 
structure features of monomers. DeepHomo2.0 was extensively evaluated on diverse 
test sets and compared with eight state-of-the-art methods including protein 
language model-based, DCA-based and machine learning-based methods. It was shown 
that DeepHomo2.0 achieved a high precision of >70% with experimental monomer 
structures and >60% with predicted monomer structures for the top 10 predicted 
contacts on the test sets and outperformed the other eight methods. Moreover, 
even the version without using structure information, named DeepHomoSeq, still 
achieved a good precision of >55% for the top 10 predicted contacts. Integrating 
the predicted contacts into protein docking significantly improved the structure 
prediction of realistic Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction 
homodimeric complexes. DeepHomo2.0 and DeepHomoSeq are available at 
http://huanglab.phys.hust.edu.cn/DeepHomo2/.

Calibrated bagging deep learning for image semantic segmentation: A case study 
on COVID-19 chest X-ray image.

Nwosu L(1), Li X(1)(2), Qian L(1)(2), Kim S(1), Dong X(1)(2).

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19). Imaging tests such as chest X-ray (CXR) and computed 
tomography (CT) can provide useful information to clinical staff for 
facilitating a diagnosis of COVID-19 in a more efficient and comprehensive 
manner. As a breakthrough of artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning has 
been applied to perform COVID-19 infection region segmentation and disease 
classification by analyzing CXR and CT data. However, prediction uncertainty of 
deep learning models for these tasks, which is very important to safety-critical 
applications like medical image processing, has not been comprehensively 
investigated. In this work, we propose a novel ensemble deep learning model 
through integrating bagging deep learning and model calibration to not only 
enhance segmentation performance, but also reduce prediction uncertainty. The 
proposed method has been validated on a large dataset that is associated with 
CXR image segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed 
method can improve the segmentation performance, as well as decrease prediction 
uncertainty.

Quantitative computed tomography-based evaluation of skeletal muscle and 
presence of sarcopenia in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Sato S(1), Muro S(2), Aoyama T(3), Hirai T(4).

Sarcopenia, or age-related muscle loss, is a common comorbidity in patients with 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with multiple contributing factors. 
We hypothesized that the presence of sarcopenia can be estimated using 
quantitative computed tomography-based parameters in patients with COPD. We 
retrospectively evaluated 38 elderly (≥65 years) men with COPD for pooled data, 
including hand grip strength and gait speed. Sarcopenia was diagnosed based on 
the updated 2019 criteria set by the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia.

(PM) were quantitatively evaluated and adjusted by height (ESM-I, and PM-I). 
Sarcopenia was diagnosed in 11 (29%) patients. The mean ESM-I and PM-I were 11.0 
and 9.5 cm2/m2, respectively, and significantly correlated with height-adjusted 
appendicular skeletal muscle mass. The optimal cutoff ESM-I for the presence of 
sarcopenia was 9.41 cm2/m2. ESM loss helped estimate sarcopenia in patients with 
COPD.

Res-Dom: predicting protein domain boundary from sequence using deep residual 
network and Bi-LSTM.

Wang L(1)(2), Zhong H(2), Xue Z(1)(3), Wang Y(1)(2).

MOTIVATION: Protein domains are the basic units of proteins that can fold, 
function and evolve independently. Protein domain boundary partition plays an 
important role in protein structure prediction, understanding their biological 
functions, annotating their evolutionary mechanisms and protein design. Although 
there are many methods that have been developed to predict domain boundaries 
from protein sequence over the past two decades, there is still much room for 
improvement.
RESULTS: In this article, a novel domain boundary prediction tool called Res-Dom 
was developed, which is based on a deep residual network, bidirectional long 
short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) and transfer learning. We used deep residual neural 
networks to extract higher-order residue-related information. In addition, we 
also used a pre-trained protein language model called ESM to extract sequence 
embedded features, which can summarize sequence context information more 
abundantly. To improve the global representation of these deep residual 
networks, a Bi-LSTM network was also designed to consider long-range 
interactions between residues. Res-Dom was then tested on an independent test 
set including 342 proteins and generated correct single-domain and multi-domain 
classifications with a Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.668, which was 
17.6% higher than the second-best compared method. For domain boundaries, the 
normalized domain overlapping score of Res-Dom was 0.849, which was 5% higher 
than the second-best compared method. Furthermore, Res-Dom required 
significantly less time than most of the recently developed state-of-the-art 
domain prediction methods.

Bioluminescence imaging of fibroblast activation protein-alpha in vivo and human 
plasma with highly sensitive probe.

Zhang L(1), Ying W(2), Sheng Z(2), Lv L(2), Gao J(2), Xue Y(2), Liu L(2).

Fibroblast activation protein-alpha (FAPα) has emerged as a biomarker of tumor 
stromal fibroblasts. FAP was overexpressed in stromal fibroblasts of human 
malignancies and positively correlated with the depth of tumor invasion, 
lymphatic metastasis, distant metastases, high TNM stage and poor prognosis. 
However, the circulating FAP levels in the plasma of gastric cancer patients and 
the relationship between FAP levels and gastric cancer remain unknown. Moreover, 
probes with super selectivity, extremely high sensitivity, and excellent 
performance in quantitative detection are still lacking. Herein, we developed 
the bioluminescent probe BL-FAP for sensitive detection and imaging of 
endogenous FAP in gastric cancer cells and tissues and plasma from gastric 
cancer patients. The probe exhibited the high signal-to-noise ratio 
(15000∼fold), the excellent selectivity (FAP/DPP IV ratio and FAP/PREP 
ratio = 50000∼ fold), and the high sensitivity (18.1 pg/mL). BL-FAP facilitates 
monitoring of endogenous FAP in living cells and nude mice bearing MGC-803-luc 
tumors. More importantly, this probe was successfully applied to the measurement 
of FAP activity levels in plasma from gastric cancer patients for the first 
time. A significant enhancement in FAP levels was observed in patients with 
gastric cancer, suggesting that the FAP level may be a potential diagnostic 
parameter for gastric cancer.

Liposomal Doxorubicin: the Sphingomyelin/Cholesterol System Significantly 
Enhances the Antitumor Efficacy of Doxorubicin.

Meng X(1), Zhang H(1), Chen L(1), Wang M(1), Zhang K(1), Liu X(1), Deng Y(2), 
Song Y(3).

Doxorubicin (DOX) has a cytotoxic effect on many tumor cells; however, its 
clinical application is limited owing to its strong side effects. Although 
Doxil® reduces the cardiotoxicity of free DOX, it has also introduced a new 
dose-limiting toxicity. In a previous study, a sialic acid-cholesterol conjugate 
(SA-CH) was synthesized and modified onto the surface of DOX-loaded liposomes to 
target tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), further improving the efficacy of 
DOX-loaded liposomes over that of Doxil®. Meanwhile, the good retention 
characteristics and promising antitumor ability of sphingomyelin/cholesterol 
(SM/CH) system for water-soluble drugs have attracted wide attention. Therefore, 
we aimed to use SA-CH as the target and hydrogenated soybean phosphatidylcholine 
(HSPC) or egg sphingomyelin (ESM) as the membrane material to develop a more 
stable DOX-loaded liposome with stronger antitumor activity. The liposomes were 
evaluated for particle size, polydispersity index, zeta potential, entrapment 
efficiency, in vitro release, long-term storage, cytotoxicity, cellular uptake, 
pharmacokinetics, tumor targetability, and in vivo antitumor activity. In the 
liposomes prepared using HSPC/CH, sialic acid (SA) modification considerably 
increased the accumulation of DOX-loaded liposomes in the tumor, thus exerting a 
better antitumor effect. However, SA modification in DOX-ESL (SA-CH-modified 
DOX-loaded liposomes prepared by ESM/CH) destroyed the strong retention effect 
of the ESM/CH system on DOX, resulting in a reduced antitumor effect. Notably, 
DOX-ECL (DOX-loaded liposome prepared by ESM/CH) had the optimal storage 
stability, lowest toxicity, and optimal antitumor effect due to better drug 
retention properties. Thus, the ESM/CH liposome of DOX is a potential drug 
delivery system. Sketch of the effect of two DOX-loaded liposomes with 
hydrogenated soybean phospholipid (HSPC) and egg sphingomyelin (ESM) as lipid 
membrane material and surface-modified SA derivative on tumor growth inhibition.

Many-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm With Reference Point-Based Fuzzy 
Correlation Entropy for Energy-Efficient Job Shop Scheduling With Limited 
Workers.

Li W, He L, Cao Y.

Because of COVID-19, factories are facing many difficulties, such as shortage of 
workers and social alienation. How to improve production performance under 
limited labor resources is an urgent problem for global manufacturing factories. 
This work studies an energy-efficient job-shop scheduling problem with limited 
workers. Those workers can have multiskills. A many-objective model with five 
objectives, that is: 1) makespan; 2) total tardiness; 3) total idle time; 4) 
total worker cost; and 5) total energy, is built. To solve this many-objective 
optimization problem (MaOP), a novel fitness evaluation mechanism (FEM) based on 
fuzzy correlation entropy (FCE) is adopted. Two construction methods for 
reference points are proposed to build the bridge between MaOP and a fuzzy set. 
Based on FCE and cluster methods, an environmental selection mechanism (ESM) is 
proposed to achieve a balance between solution convergence and diversity. With 
the proposed FEM and ESM, two many-objective evolutionary algorithms are 
proposed to solve MaOP. The effect of FCE-based FEM and ESM on the performance 
of algorithms is verified via experiments. The proposed algorithms are compared 
with four well-known peers to test their performance. The extensive experimental 
results show that they are very competitive for the considered many-objective 
scheduling problem.

Osteoblasts in a Perfusion Flow Bioreactor-Tissue Engineered Constructs of 
TiO(2) Scaffolds and Cells for Improved Clinical Performance.

Schröder M(1), Reseland JE(1), Haugen HJ(1).

Combining biomaterial scaffolds with cells serves as a promising strategy for 
engineering critical size defects; however, homogenous cellular growth within 
large scaffolds is challenging. Mechanical stimuli can enhance bone regeneration 
by modulating cellular growth and differentiation. Here, we compare dynamic 
seeding in a perfusion flow bioreactor with static seeding for a synthetic bone 
scaffold for up to 21 days using the cell line MC3T3-E1 and primary human 
osteoblast, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and real-time reverse 
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The secretion of bone-related proteins 
was quantified using multiplex immunoassays. Dynamic culture improved cellular 
distribution through the TiO2 scaffold and induced a five-fold increase in cell 
number after 21 days. The relative mRNA expression of osteopontin of MC3T3-E1 
was 40-fold enhanced after 7 and 21 days at a flow rate of 0.08 mL/min, and that 
of collagen type I alpha I expression was 18-fold after 21 days. A flow rate of 
0.16 mL/min was 10-fold less effective. Dynamic culture increased the levels of 
dickkopf-related protein 1 (60-fold), osteoprotegrin (29-fold), interleukin-6 
(23-fold), interleukin-8 (36-fold), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (28-fold) 
and vascular endothelial growth factor (6-fold) in the medium of primary human 
osteoblasts after 21 days compared to static seeding. The proposed method may 
have clinical potential for bone tissue engineering.

Nonerythroid hemoglobin promotes human cumulus cell viability and the 
developmental capacity of the human oocyte.

Makhijani RB(1), Bartolucci AF(2), Pru CA(3), Pru JK(3), Peluso JJ(4).

OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between the levels of cumulus cell (CC) 
hemoglobin messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and the developmental potential of 
the associated oocyte and whether hemoglobin protects the CCs from oxidative 
stress-induced apoptosis.
DESIGN: Laboratory-based study.
SETTING: University laboratory and university-affiliated in vitro fertilization 
center.
PATIENT(S): Cumulus cells from the oocytes of patients who underwent in vitro 
fertilization with intracytoplasmic sperm injection with and without 
preimplantation genetic testing between 2018 and 2020.
INTERVENTION(S): Studies on individual and pooled CCs collected at the time of 
oocyte retrieval or cultured under 20% or 5% O2.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of 
individual and pooled patient CC samples were used to monitor the hemoglobin 
mRNA levels. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction arrays were used to 
assess genes that regulate oxidative stress in CCs associated with aneuploid and 
euploid blastocysts. Studies were conducted to assess the effect of oxidative 
stress on the rate of apoptosis, level of reactive oxygen species, and gene 
expression in CCs in vitro.
RESULT(S): Compared with CCs associated with arrested and aneuploid blastocysts, 
the mRNA levels encoding the alpha and beta chains of hemoglobin increased by 
2.9- and 2.3-fold in CCs associated with euploid blastocysts, respectively. The 
mRNA levels encoding the alpha and beta chains of hemoglobin also increased by 
3.8- and 4.5-fold in CCs cultured under 5% O2 vs. 20% O2, respectively, and 
multiple regulators of oxidative stress were overexpressed in cells cultured 
under 20% O2 compared with those under 5% O2. However, the rate of apoptosis and 
amount of mitochondrial reactive oxidative species increased by 1.25-fold in CCs 
cultured under 20% O2 compared with those under 5% O2. Variable amounts of the 
alpha and beta chains of hemoglobin were also detected within the zona pellucida 
and oocytes.
CONCLUSION(S): Higher levels of nonerythroid hemoglobin in CCs are associated 
with oocytes that result in euploid blastocysts. Hemoglobin may protect CCs from 
oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, which may enhance cumulus-oocyte 
interactions. Moreover, CC-derived hemoglobin may be transferred to the oocytes 
and protect it from the adverse effects of oxidative stress that occurs in vivo 
and in vitro.

PiTE: TCR-epitope Binding Affinity Prediction Pipeline using Transformer-based 
Sequence Encoder.

Zhang P(1), Bang S, Lee H.

Accurate prediction of TCR binding affinity to a target antigen is important for 
development of immunotherapy strategies. Recent computational methods were built 
on various deep neural networks and used the evolutionary-based distance matrix 
BLOSUM to embed amino acids of TCR and epitope sequences to numeric values. A 
pre-trained language model of amino acids is an alternative embedding method 
where each amino acid in a peptide is embedded as a continuous numeric vector. 
Little attention has yet been given to summarize the amino-acid-wise embedding 
vectors to sequence-wise representations. In this paper, we propose PiTE, a 
two-step pipeline for the TCR-epitope binding affinity prediction. First, we use 
an amino acids embedding model pre-trained on a large number of unlabeled TCR 
sequences and obtain a real-valued representation from a string representation 
of amino acid sequences. Second, we train a binding affinity prediction model 
that consists of two sequence encoders and a stack of linear layers predicting 
the affinity score of a given TCR and epitope pair. In particular, we explore 
various types of neural network architectures for the sequence encoders in the 
two-step binding affinity prediction pipeline. We show that our Transformer-like 
sequence encoder achieves a state-of-the-art performance and significantly 
outperforms the others, perhaps due to the model's ability to capture contextual 
information between amino acids in each sequence. Our work highlights that an 
advanced sequence encoder on top of pre-trained representation significantly 
improves performance of the TCR-epitope binding affinity prediction.

DsLCYB Directionally Modulated β-Carotene of the Green Alga Dunaliella salina 
under Red Light Stress.

Lan Y(1), Song Y(1), Guo Y(1), Qiao D(1), Cao Y(1), Xu H(1).

Carotenoids, which are natural pigments found abundantly in wide-ranging 
species, have diverse functions and high industrial potential. The carotenoid 
biosynthesis pathway is very complex and has multiple branches, while the 
accumulation of certain metabolites often affects other metabolites in this 
pathway. The DsLCYB gene that encodes lycopene cyclase was selected in this 
study to evaluate β-carotene production and the accumulation of β-carotene in 
the alga Dunaliella salina. Compared with the wild type, the transgenic algal 
species overexpressed the DsLCYB gene, resulting in a significant enhancement of 
the total carotenoid content, with the total amount reaching 8.46 mg/g for an 
increase of up to 1.26-fold. Interestingly, the production of α-carotene in the 
transformant was not significantly reduced. This result indicated that the 
regulation of DsLCYB on the metabolic flux distribution of carotenoid 
biosynthesis is directional. Moreover, the effects of different light-quality 
conditions on β-carotene production in D. salina strains were investigated. The 
results showed that the carotenoid components of β-carotene and β-cryptoxanthin 
were 1.8-fold and 1.23-fold higher than that in the wild type under red light 
stress, respectively. This suggests that the accumulation of β-carotene under 
red light conditions is potentially more profitable.

Generic medical concept embedding and time decay for diverse patient outcome 
prediction tasks.

Li Y(1), Dong W(2), Ru B(1), Black A(3), Zhang X(2), Guan Y(4).

Many fields, including Natural Language Processing (NLP), have recently 
witnessed the benefit of pre-training with large generic datasets to improve the 
accuracy of prediction tasks. However, there exist key differences between the 
longitudinal healthcare data (e.g., claims) and NLP tasks, which make the direct 
application of NLP pre-training methods to healthcare data inappropriate. In 
this article, we developed a pre-training scheme for longitudinal healthcare 
data that leverages the pairing of medical history and a future event. We then 
conducted systematic evaluations of various methods on ten patient-level 
prediction tasks encompassing adverse events, misdiagnosis, disease risks, and 
readmission. In addition to substantially reducing model size, our results show 
that a universal medical concept embedding pretrained with generic big data as 
well as carefully designed time decay modeling improves the accuracy of 
different downstream prediction tasks.

Genetic Disruption of Guanylyl Cyclase/Natriuretic Peptide Receptor-A Triggers 
Differential Cardiac Fibrosis and Disorders in Male and Female Mutant Mice: Role 
of TGF-β1/SMAD Signaling Pathway.

Subramanian U(1), Ramasamy C(1), Ramachandran S(1), Oakes JM(2), Gardner JD(2), 
Pandey KN(1).

The global targeted disruption of the natriuretic peptide receptor-A (NPRA) gene 
(Npr1) in mice provokes hypertension and cardiovascular dysfunction. The 
objective of this study was to determine the mechanisms regulating the 
development of cardiac fibrosis and dysfunction in Npr1 mutant mice. Npr1 
knockout (Npr1-/-, 0-copy), heterozygous (Npr1+/-, 1-copy), and wild-type 
(Npr1+/+, 2-copy) mice were treated with the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 
receptor (TGF-β1R) antagonist GW788388 (2 µg/g body weight/day; ip) for 28 days. 
Hearts were isolated and used for real-time quantitative reverse transcription 
polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), Western blot, and immunohistochemical 
analyses. The Npr1-/- (0-copy) mice showed a 6-fold induction of cardiac 
fibrosis and dysfunction with markedly induced expressions of collagen-1α 
(3.8-fold), monocyte chemoattractant protein (3.7-fold), connective tissue 
growth factor (CTGF, 5.3-fold), α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA, 6.1-fold), TGF-βRI 
(4.3-fold), TGF-βRII (4.7-fold), and phosphorylated small mothers against 
decapentaplegic (pSMAD) proteins, including pSMAD-2 (3.2-fold) and pSMAD-3 
(3.7-fold), compared with wild-type mice. The expressions of phosphorylated 
extracellular-regulated kinase ERK1/2 (pERK1/2), matrix metalloproteinases-2, 
-9, (MMP-2, -9), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were also 
significantly upregulated in Npr1 0-copy mice. The treatment of mutant mice with 
GW788388 significantly blocked the expression of fibrotic markers, SMAD 
proteins, MMPs, and PCNA compared with the vehicle-treated control mice. The 
treatment with GW788388 significantly prevented cardiac dysfunctions in a 
sex-dependent manner in Npr1 0-copy and 1-copy mutant mice. The results suggest 
that the development of cardiac fibrosis and dysfunction in mutant mice is 
predominantly regulated through the TGF-β1-mediated SMAD-dependent pathway.

Previously we found that inhibitor of differentiation 3 (Id3) gene, a 
transcriptional repressor, efficiently inhibits corneal keratocyte 
differentiation to myofibroblasts in vitro. This study evaluated the potential 
of adeno-associated virus 5 (AAV5)-mediated Id3 gene therapy to treat corneal 
scarring using an established rabbit in vivo disease model. Corneal 
scarring/fibrosis in rabbit eyes was induced by alkali trauma, and 24 h 
thereafter corneas were administered with either balanced salt solution 
AAV5-naked vector, or AAV5-Id3 vector (n = 6/group) via an optimized reported 
method. Therapeutic effects of AAV5-Id3 gene therapy on corneal pathology and 
ocular health were evaluated with clinical, histological, and molecular 
techniques. Localized AAV5-Id3 gene therapy significantly inhibited corneal 
fibrosis/haze clinically from 2.7 to 0.7 on the Fantes scale in live animals 
(AAV5-naked versus AAV5-Id3; p < 0.001). Furthermore, AAV5-Id3 treatment 
significantly reduced profibrotic gene mRNA levels: α-smooth muscle actin 
(α-SMA) (2.8-fold; p < 0.001), fibronectin (3.2-fold; p < 0.001), collagen I 
(0.8-fold; p < 0.001), and collagen III (1.4-fold; p < 0.001), as well as 
protein levels of α-SMA (23.8%; p < 0.001) and collagens (1.8-fold; p < 0.001). 
The anti-fibrotic activity of AAV5-Id3 is attributed to reduced myofibroblast 
formation by disrupting the binding of E-box proteins to the promoter of α-SMA, 
a transforming growth factor-β signaling downstream target gene. In conclusion, 
these results indicate that localized AAV5-Id3 delivery in stroma caused no 
clinically relevant ocular symptoms or corneal cellular toxicity in the rabbit 
eyes.

An objective method to identify imminent or current Multi-Inflammatory Syndrome 
in Children (MIS-C) infected with SARS-CoV-2 is highly desirable. The aims was 
to define an algorithmically interpreted novel cytokine/chemokine assay panel 
providing such an objective classification. This study was conducted on 4 groups 
of patients seen at multiple sites of Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX who 
consented to provide blood samples to our COVID-19 Biorepository. Standard 
laboratory markers of inflammation and a novel cytokine/chemokine array were 
measured in blood samples of all patients. Group 1 consisted of 72 COVID-19, 66 
MIS-C and 63 uninfected control patients seen between May 2020 and January 2021 
and predominantly infected with pre-alpha variants. Group 2 consisted of 29 
COVID-19 and 43 MIS-C patients seen between January-May 2021 infected 
predominantly with the alpha variant. Group 3 consisted of 30 COVID-19 and 32 
MIS-C patients seen between August-October 2021 infected with alpha and/or delta 
variants. Group 4 consisted of 20 COVID-19 and 46 MIS-C patients seen between 
October 2021-January 2022 infected with delta and/or omicron variants. Group 1 
was used to train a L1-regularized logistic regression model which was validated 
using 5-fold cross validation, and then separately validated against the 
remaining naïve groups. The area under receiver operating curve (AUROC) and 
F1-score were used to quantify the performance of the algorithmically 
interpreted cytokine/chemokine assay panel. Standard laboratory markers predict 
MIS-C with a 5-fold cross-validated AUROC of 0.86 ± 0.05 and an F1 score of 0.78 
± 0.07, while the cytokine/chemokine panel predicted MIS-C with a 5-fold 
cross-validated AUROC of 0.95 ± 0.02 and an F1 score of 0.91 ± 0.04, with only 
sixteen of the forty-five cytokines/chemokines sufficient to achieve this 
performance. Tested on Group 2 the cytokine/chemokine panel yielded AUROC =0.98, 
F1=0.93, on Group 3 it yielded AUROC=0.89, F1 = 0.89, and on Group 4 AUROC= 
0.99, F1= 0.97). Adding standard laboratory markers to the cytokine/chemokine 
panel did not improve performance. A top-10 subset of these 16 cytokines 
achieves equivalent performance on the validation data sets. Our findings 
demonstrate that a sixteen-cytokine/chemokine panel as well as the top ten 
subset provides a sensitive, specific method to identify MIS-C in patients 
infected with SARS-CoV-2 of all the major variants identified to date.

Genetic variation in alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) causes AAT deficiency (AATD) 
through liver aggregation-associated gain-of-toxic pathology and/or insufficient 
AAT activity in the lung manifesting as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD). Here, we utilize 71 AATD-associated variants as input through Gaussian 
process (GP)-based machine learning to study the correction of AAT folding and 
function at a residue-by-residue level by pharmacological activation of the ATF6 
arm of the unfolded protein response (UPR). We show that ATF6 activators 
increase AAT neutrophil elastase (NE) inhibitory activity, while reducing 
polymer accumulation for the majority of AATD variants, including the prominent 
Z variant. GP-based profiling of the residue-by-residue response to ATF6 
activators captures an unexpected role of the "gate" area in managing 
AAT-specific activity. Our work establishes a new spatial covariant (SCV) 
understanding of the convertible state of the protein fold in response to 
genetic perturbation and active environmental management by proteostasis 
enhancement for precision medicine.

A BET Protein Inhibitor Targeting Mononuclear Myeloid Cells Affects Specific 
Inflammatory Mediators and Pathways in Crohn's Disease.

AYF(1)(2)(5), Joustra VW(3), Mulders L(3), Fung I(1), Rioja I(2), Prinjha RK(2), 
Smithers NN(2), Furze RC(2), Mander PK(2), Bell MJ(2), Buskens CJ(6), D'Haens 
GR(3), Wildenberg ME(1), de Jonge WJ(1)(7).

BACKGROUND: Myeloid cells are critical determinants of the sustained 
inflammation in Crohn's Disease (CD). Targeting such cells may be an effective 
therapeutic approach for refractory CD patients. Bromodomain and extra-terminal 
domain protein inhibitors (iBET) are potent anti-inflammatory agents; however, 
they also possess wide-ranging toxicities. In the current study, we make use of 
a BET inhibitor containing an esterase sensitive motif (ESM-iBET), which is 
cleaved by carboxylesterase-1 (CES1), a highly expressed esterase in mononuclear 
myeloid cells.
METHODS: We profiled CES1 protein expression in the intestinal biopsies, 
peripheral blood, and CD fistula tract (fCD) cells of CD patients using mass 
cytometry. The anti-inflammatory effect of ESM-iBET or its control (iBET) were 
evaluated in healthy donor CD14+ monocytes and fCD cells, using cytometric beads 
assay or RNA-sequencing.
RESULTS: CES1 was specifically expressed in monocyte, macrophage, and dendritic 
cell populations in the intestinal tissue, peripheral blood, and fCD cells of CD 
patients. ESM-iBET inhibited IL1β, IL6, and TNFα secretion from healthy donor 
CD14+ monocytes and fCD immune cells, with 10- to 26-fold more potency over iBET 
in isolated CD14+ monocytes. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that ESM-iBET 
inhibited multiple inflammatory pathways, including TNF, JAK-STAT, NF-kB, NOD2, 
and AKT signaling, with superior potency over iBET.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate specific CES1 expression in mononuclear myeloid cell

low dose ESM-iBET accumulates in CES1-expressing cells and exerts robust 
anti-inflammatory effects, which could be beneficial in refractory CD patients.

Effects of Valsartan and Amlodipine Tablets Combined with α-Lipoic Acid on 
T-AOC, IL-6 and β2-MG Levels in Patients with Diabetic Nephropathy.

Su F, Xia Q.

Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the most important cause of chronic renal and 
end-stage kidney disease in China. Hypertension (HTN) is highly prevalent in 
individuals with diabetic nephropathy. Arterial HTN affects two-thirds of people 
with type 2 diabetes (T2D). In these patients, HTN increased the potential of 
both micro- and macrovascular complications, and the co-occurrence of 2 such 
principal causes results in a 4-fold increased risk for cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) when contrasted with normotensive controls without diabetes. Therefore, 
the results of valsartan and amlodipine tablets combined with alpha-lipoic acid 
on total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) need to be investigated. The aim of this 
study was to analyze the effects of valsartan (VA) and amlodipine tablets 
combined with alpha-lipoic acid (α-LA) on T-AOC, IL-6 and β2-MG levels in 
patients with DN. We performed statistical analysis including the chi-square 
test, independent t-test, paired t-test and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Our 
findings indicate that VA, amlodipine and α-LA has a significant effect in 
patients with DN.

Titanium particles incorporated polymer monolith microcolumn for phosphoprotein 
enrichment from biological samples.

Aparna GM(1), Tetala KKR(2).

In proteomic studies, selective enrichment of target phosphoproteins from 
biological samples is of importance. Of various enrichment methods, affinity 
chromatography is widely preferred method. Development of micro-affinity columns 
with simple strategies are in constant demand. Here in this report, for the 
first time, we have embedded TiO2 particles within the monolith structure in a 
single step. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron 
microscope analysis has confirmed the successful incorporation of TiO2 particles 
within the polymer monolith. Incorporation of 3-(trimethoxy silyl) propyl 
methacrylate within the poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) based monolith 
composition has enhanced its rigidity and one fold phosphoprotein (α-casein) 
adsorption capacity. Presence of only 66.6 µg of TiO2 particles within the 
monolith has displayed a four-fold higher affinity to α-casein over the 
non-phosphoprotein i.e. bovine serum albumin. Under optimized conditions (TiO2 
particle and acrylate silane), the affinity monolith has a maximum adsorption 
capacity of ∼ 72 mg per gram monolith. Translation of TiO2 particles-monolith 
into a microcolumn of 3 cm long and 19 µL volume was successful. α-casein was 
selectively separated from an artificial protein mixture of α-casein and BSA, 
α-casein spiked human plasma, and cow milk within 7 min.

Associations between Deformation of the Thoracolumbar Fascia and Activation of 
the Erector Spinae and Multifidus Muscle in Patients with Acute Low Back Pain 
and Healthy Controls: A Matched Pair Case-Control Study.

Brandl A(1)(2)(3), Egner C(2), Reer R(1), Schmidt T(3)(4), Schleip R(2)(5).

Background: The thoracolumbar fascia (TLF) is thought to play a role in the 
development of LBP, but it is not yet clear which factor of TLF changes is a 
cause and which is an effect. Therefore, some studies used the cross-correlation 
function (CCR) to reveal time-dependent relationships between biomechanical and 
neuromotor factors. Methods: Ten patients with acute low back pain (aLBP) were 
matched to healthy controls. Simultaneous recording of surface electromyography 
(sEMG) of the erector spinae and multifidus muscle (ESM) and dynamic ultrasound 
(US) images of TLF deformation were performed during trunk extension. CCR 
functions and Granger causality (GC) were used to describe the relationship 
between the two measures. Results: CCR time lags were significant higher in the 
aLBP group (p = 0.04). GC showed a direct effect of TLF deformation on ESM 
activation only in the aLBP group (p < 0.03). Conclusions: The results suggest 
that in aLBP, ESM activity is significantly affected by TLF, whereas this 
relationship is completely random in healthy subjects studied with CCR and GC 
comparisons of dynamic US imaging and sEMG data signals. Fascia-related 
disturbances in neuromotor control, particularly due to altered muscle spindle 
functions, are suspected as a possible mechanism behind this.

Folate and Vitamin B(12) Deficiency Exacerbate Inflammation during Mycobacterium 
avium paratuberculosis (MAP) Infection.

Vaccaro JA(1), Qasem A(1), Naser SA(1).

Folate and vitamin B12 deficiency is highly prevalent among Crohn's disease (CD) 
patients. Furthermore, CD pathology can be mediated by Mycobacterium avium 
subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) infection. However, the direct effect of folate 
(B9) and cobalamin (B12) deficiency during MAP infection remains 
uncharacterized. This study investigates how folate and B12 deficiency impedes 
macrophage apoptosis and exacerbates the inflammation in macrophages infected 
with MAP isolated from CD patients. Accordingly, we measured folate and B12 in 
ex vivo plasma samples collected from CD patients with or without MAP infection 
(N = 35 per group). We also measured the expression of the pro-inflammatory 
cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α, cellular apoptosis and viability markers, and 
bacterial viability in MAP-infected macrophages cultured in folate and B12 
deficient media. We determined that MAP-positive CD patients have significantly 
lower plasma folate and B12 in comparison to MAP-negative CD patients [414.48 ± 
94.60 pg/mL vs. 512.86 ± 129.12 pg/mL, respectively]. We further show that 
pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α are significantly upregulated during 
folate and vitamin B12 deprivation following MAP infection by several folds, 
while supplementation significantly reduces their expression by several folds. 
Additionally, depletion of folate, B12, and folate/B12 following MAP infection, 
led to decreased macrophage apoptosis from 1.83 ± 0.40-fold to 1.04 ± 0.08, 0.64 
± 0.12, and 0.45 ± 0.07 in folate-low, B12-low, and folate/B12-low cells, 
respectively. By contrast, folate and folate/B12 supplementation resulted in 
3.38 ± 0.70 and 2.58 ± 0.14-fold increases in infected macrophages. 
Interestingly, changes in overall macrophage viability were only observed in 
folate-high, folate/B12-high, and folate/B12-low media, with 0.80 ± 0.05, 0.82 ± 
0.02, and 0.91 ± 0.04-fold changes, respectively. Incubation of Caco-2 
intestinal epithelial monolayers with supernatant from infected macrophages 
revealed that folate/B12 deficiency led to increased LDH release independent of 
oxidative stress. Overall, our results indicate that folate and B12 are key 
vitamins affecting cell survival and inflammation during MAP infection.

Combining actigraphy and experience sampling to assess physical activity and 
sleep in patients with psychosis: A feasibility study.

Pieters LE(1)(2), Deenik J(1)(2), de Vet S(1), Delespaul P(2)(3), van Harten 
PN(1)(2).

BACKGROUND: Sleep disorders and reduced physical activity are common in patients 
with psychosis and can be related to health-related outcomes such as 
symptomatology and functioning. Mobile health technologies and wearable sensor 
methods enable continuous and simultaneous monitoring of physical activity, 
sleep, and symptoms in one's day-to-day environment. Only a few studies have 
applied simultaneous assessment of these parameters. Therefore, we aimed to 
examine the feasibility of the simultaneous monitoring of physical activity, 
sleep, and symptoms and functioning in psychosis.
METHODS: Thirty three outpatients diagnosed with a schizophrenia or other 
psychotic disorder used an actigraphy watch and experience sampling method (ESM) 
smartphone app for 7 consecutive days to monitor physical activity, sleep, 
symptoms, and functioning. Participants wore the actigraphy watch during day and 
night and completed multiple short questionnaires (eight daily, one morning, and 
one evening) on their phone. Hereafter they completed evaluation questionnaires.
RESULTS: Of the 33 patients (25 male), 32 (97.0%) used the ESM and actigraphy 
during the instructed timeframe. ESM response was good: 64.0% for the daily, 
90.6% for morning, and 82.6% for evening questionnaire(s). Participants were 
positive about the use of actigraphy and ESM.
CONCLUSION: The combination of wrist-worn actigraphy and smartphone-based ESM is 
feasible and acceptable in outpatients with psychosis. These novel methods can 
help both clinical practice and future research to gain more valid insight into 
physical activity and sleep as biobehavioral markers linked to 
psychopathological symptoms and functioning in psychosis. This can be used to 
investigate relationships between these outcomes and thereby improve 
individualized treatment and prediction.

An Agonistic Monoclonal Antibody Targeting cMet Attenuates Inflammation and 
Up-Regulates Collagen Synthesis and Angiogenesis in Type 2 Diabetic Mice Wounds.

Choi MH(1), Jang TS(1), Kim H(1), Ku I(1), Lee J(1), Jeong JG(1), Kim S(1), Park 
JU(1).

BACKGROUND: Diabetic wounds account for 25 to 50 percent of total diabetic 
health care costs annually, and present overall healing rates of less than 50 
percent. Because delayed diabetic wound healing is associated with impaired 
fibroblast function, the authors hypothesize that tyrosine kinase Met (cMet) 
agonistic monoclonal antibody will promote diabetic wound healing by means of 
stable activation of hepatocyte growth factor/cMet signaling.
METHODS: Two 6-mm dorsal wounds were created in each mouse (6-week-old, male 
BKS.Cg-Dock7 m +/+Lepr db /J; n = 5). After subcutaneous injections of agonist 
(20 mg/kg) at 0 and 72 hours, the wound sizes were measured at days 0, 1, 3, 6, 
and 10. Histologic and immunohistochemical analyses were performed at day 10 
(cMet, α-smooth muscle actin, CD68, and transforming growth factor-β). In vitro 
cytotoxicity and migration tests with diabetic fibroblasts were performed with 
or without agonist treatment (1 or 10 nM). cMet pathway activation of 
fibroblasts was confirmed through p-p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase, 
p-mTOR, p-cMet, and ROCK-1 expression.
RESULTS: The cMet agonistic monoclonal antibody-treated group showed 1.60-fold 
lower wound area ( p = 0.027), 1.54-fold higher collagen synthesis ( p = 0.001), 
and 1.79-fold lower inflammatory cell infiltration ( p = 0.032) than the 
saline-treated control. The agonist increased cMet (1.86-fold; p = 0.029), 
α-smooth muscle actin (1.20-fold; p = 0.018), and vascular endothelial growth 
factor (1.68-fold, p = 0.029) expression but suppressed CD68 (1.25-fold; p = 
0.043), transforming growth factor-β (1.25-fold; p = 0.022), and matrix 
metalloproteinase-2 (2.59-fold; p = 0.029) expression. In vitro agonist 
treatment (10 nM) of diabetic fibroblasts increased their migration by 8.98-fold 
( p = 0.029) and activated the hepatocyte growth factor/cMet pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: Tyrosine kinase Met agonistic monoclonal antibody treatment 
improved diabetic wound healing in mice and reduced wound-site inflammatory cell 
infiltration. These results need to be validated in large animals before 
piloting human trials.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Although further clinical studies are necessary to 
evaluate its therapeutic efficacy, our study suggested that cMet agonistic 
monoclonal antibody can be the alternative modality in order to improve wound 
healing cascade in diabetic foot patients.

Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Substituted Pyrazole-Fused Oleanolic Acid 
Derivatives as Novel Selective α-Glucosidase Inhibitors.

Gao M(1)(2), Ma H(2), Liu X(2), Zhang Y(2), Tang L(2), Zheng Z(2), Zhang X(3), 
Jiang C(4), Lin L(2), Sun H(1).

A series of novel substituted pyrazole-fused oleanolic acid derivative were 
synthesized and evaluated as selective α-glucosidase inhibitors. Among these 
analogs, compounds 4a-4f exhibited more potent inhibitory activities compared 
with their methyl ester derivatives, and standard drugs acarbose and miglitol as 
well. Besides, all these analogs exhibited good selectivity towards 
α-glucosidase over α-amylase. Analog 4d showed potent inhibitory activity 
against α-glucosidase (IC50 =2.64±0.13 μM), and greater selectivity towards 
α-glucosidase than α-amylase by ∼33-fold. Inhibition kinetics showed that 
compound 4d was a non-competitive α-glucosidase inhibitor, which was consistent 
with the result of its simulation molecular docking. Moreover, the in vitro 
cytotoxicity of compounds 4a-4f towards hepatic LO2 and HepG2 cells was tested.

Evaluating near-infrared photoimmunotherapy for targeting fibroblast activation 
protein-α expressing cells in vitro and in vivo.

Jin J(1), Barnett JD(1), Krishnamachary B(1), Mironchik Y(1), Luo CK(1), 
Kobayashi H(2), Bhujwalla ZM(1)(3)(4).

Photoimmunotherapy (PIT), carried out using an Ab conjugated to the near 
infrared dye IRDye700DX, is achieving significant success in target-specific 
elimination of cells. Fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP-α) is an 
important target in cancer because of its expression by cancer-associated 
fibroblasts (CAFs) as well as by some cancer cells. Cancer-associated 
fibroblasts that express FAP-α have protumorigenic and immune suppressive 
functions. Using immunohistochemistry of human breast cancer tissue microarrays, 
we identified an increase of FAP-α+  CAFs in invasive breast cancer tissue 
compared to adjacent normal tissue. We found FAP-α expression increased in 
fibroblasts cocultured with cancer cells. In proof-of-principle studies, we 
engineered human FAP-α overexpressing MDA-MB-231 and HT-1080 cancer cells and 
murine FAP-α overexpressing NIH-3T3 fibroblasts to evaluate several anti-FAP-α 
Abs and selected AF3715 based on its high binding affinity with both human and 
mouse FAP-α. After conjugation of AF3715 with the phthalocyanine dye IR700, the 
resultant Ab conjugate, FAP-α-IR700, was evaluated in cells and tumors for its 
specificity and effectiveness in eliminating FAP-α expressing cell populations 
with PIT. Fibroblast activation protein-α-IR700-PIT resulted in effective 
FAP-α-specific cell killing in the engineered cancer cells and in two 
patient-derived CAFs in a dose-dependent manner. Following an intravenous 
injection, FAP-α-IR700 retention was three-fold higher than IgG-IR700 in FAP-α 
overexpressing tumors, and two-fold higher compared to WT tumors. Fibroblast 
activation protein-α-IR700-PIT resulted in significant growth inhibition of 
tumors derived from FAP-α overexpressing human cancer cells. A reduction of 
endogenous FAP-α+  murine CAFs was identified at 7 days after FAP-α-IR700-PIT. 
Fibroblast activation protein-α-targeted near infrared PIT presents a promising 
strategy to eliminate FAP-α+  CAFs.

Food production in space from CO(2) using microbial electrosynthesis.

Alvarado KA(1), García Martínez JB(2), Brown MM(2), Christodoulou X(3), Bryson 
S(4), Denkenberger DC(5).

The current food method in space is launching prepackaged food which is costly 
and unsustainable. Alternatives include growing crops and microalgae single cell 
protein (SCP) using artificial light photosynthesis, which are energy 
inefficient. Prepackaged food and microalgae food were compared to microbial 
electrosynthesis of acetic acid (MES-AA). Since the dominant cost of a space 
mission is the cost of launching mass, components of a system were converted to 
an equivalent mass, including power, heat rejection, and volume. Three-year 
roundtrip crewed missions were evaluated for the International Space Station, 
the Moon, and Mars. The average Equivalent System Mass (ESM) of MES-AA is 1.38x 
and 2.84x lower than prepackaged food and microalgae SCP, respectively. The 
expected electricity-to-calorie conversion efficiency of MES-AA is 19.8 %, 
consuming 3.45 kW to fully feed five astronauts; diets would realistically 
include multiple foods. MES-AA has a higher energy efficiency than any currently 
investigated resilient food in space. MES-AA can provide diet diversity at a 
lower cost than customarily storing prepackaged food or growing crops in space. 
Producing food while contributing to closed loop life support in space can 
contribute to reducing global catastrophic risk and is relevant in off-grid 
communities, like in rural Alaska.

We present CARDIO:DE, the first freely available and distributable large German 
clinical corpus from the cardiovascular domain. CARDIO:DE encompasses 500 
clinical routine German doctor's letters from Heidelberg University Hospital, 
which were manually annotated. Our prospective study design complies well with 
current data protection regulations and allows us to keep the original structure 
of clinical documents consistent. In order to ease access to our corpus, we 
manually de-identified all letters. To enable various information extraction 
tasks the temporal information in the documents was preserved. We added two 
high-quality manual annotation layers to CARDIO:DE, (1) medication information 
and (2) CDA-compliant section classes. To the best of our knowledge, CARDIO:DE 
is the first freely available and distributable German clinical corpus in the 
cardiovascular domain. In summary, our corpus offers unique opportunities for 
collaborative and reproducible research on natural language processing models 
for German clinical texts.

In silico insights into the dimer structure and deiodinase activity of type III 
iodothyronine deiodinase from bioinformatics, molecular dynamics simulations, 
and QM/MM calculations.

Marsan ES(1), Dreab A(1), Bayse CA(1).

The homodimeric family of iodothyronine deiodinases (Dios) regioselectively 
remove iodine from thyroid hormones. Currently, structural data has only been 
reported for the monomer of the mus type III thioredoxin (Trx) fold catalytic 
domain (Dio3Trx), but the mode of dimerization has not yet been determined. 
Various groups have proposed dimer structures that are similar to the A-type and 
B-type dimerization modes of peroxiredoxins. Computational methods are used to 
compare the sequence of Dio3Trx to related proteins known to form A-type and 
B-type dimers. Sequence analysis and in silico protein-protein docking methods 
suggest that Dio3Trx is more consistent with proteins that adopt B-type 
dimerization. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the refined Dio3Trx dimer 
constructed using the SymmDock and GalaxyRefineComplex databases indicate stable 
dimer formation along the β4α3 interface consistent with other Trx fold B-type 
dimers. Free energy calculations show that the dimer is stabilized by interdimer 
interactions between the β-sheets and α-helices. A comparison of MD simulations 
of the apo and thyroxine-bound dimers suggests that the active site binding 
pocket is not affected by dimerization. Determination of the transition state 
for deiodination of thyroxine from the monomer structure using QM/MM methods 
provides an activation barrier consistent with previous small model DFT 
studies.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

A Novel Soy Isoflavone Derivative, 3'-Hydroxyglycitin, with Potent Antioxidant 
and Anti-α-Glucosidase Activity.

Wu JY(1), Wang TY(2), Ding HY(3), Lee CC(4), Chang TS(4).

This study demonstrated the enzymatic hydroxylation of glycitin to 
3'-hydroxyglycitin, confirming the structure by mass and nucleic magnetic 
resonance spectral analyses. The bioactivity assays further revealed that the 
new compound possessed over 100-fold higher 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazine 
free-radical scavenging activity than the original glycitin, although its 
half-time of stability was 22.3 min. Furthermore, the original glycitin lacked 
anti-α-glucosidase activity, whereas the low-toxic 3'-hydroxyglycitin displayed 
a 10-fold higher anti-α-glucosidase activity than acarbose, a standard clinical 
antidiabetic drug. The inhibition mode of 3'-hydroxyglycitin was noncompetitive, 
with a Ki value of 0.34 mM. These findings highlight the potential use of the 
new soy isoflavone 3'-hydroxyglycitin in biotechnology industries in the future.

Deep learning to refine the identification of high-quality clinical research 
articles from the biomedical literature: Performance evaluation.

T(2), Cotoi C(2), Germini F(4), Linkins L(5), Haynes RB(4), Chu L(6), Iorio 
A(4).

BACKGROUND: Identifying practice-ready evidence-based journal articles in 
medicine is a challenge due to the sheer volume of biomedical research 
publications. Newer approaches to support evidence discovery apply deep learning 
techniques to improve the efficiency and accuracy of classifying sound evidence.
OBJECTIVE: To determine how well deep learning models using variants of 
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) identify 
high-quality evidence with high clinical relevance from the biomedical 
literature for consideration in clinical practice.
METHODS: We fine-tuned variations of BERT models (BERTBASE, BioBERT, BlueBERT, 
and PubMedBERT) and compared their performance in classifying articles based on 
methodological quality criteria. The dataset used for fine-tuning models 
included titles and abstracts of >160,000 PubMed records from 2012 to 2020 that 
were of interest to human health which had been manually labeled based on 
meeting established critical appraisal criteria for methodological rigor. The 
data was randomly divided into 80:10:10 sets for training, validating, and 
testing. In addition to using the full unbalanced set, the training data was 
randomly undersampled into four balanced datasets to assess performance and 
select the best performing model. For each of the four sets, one model that 
maintained sensitivity (recall) at ≥99% was selected and were ensembled. The 
best performing model was evaluated in a prospective, blinded test and applied 
to an established reference standard, the Clinical Hedges dataset.
RESULTS: In training, three of the four selected best performing models were 
trained using BioBERTBASE. The ensembled model did not boost performance 
compared with the best individual model. Hence a solo BioBERT-based model (named 
DL-PLUS) was selected for further testing as it was computationally more 
efficient. The model had high recall (>99%) and 60% to 77% specificity in a 
prospective evaluation conducted with blinded research associates and saved >60% 
of the work required to identify high quality articles.
CONCLUSIONS: Deep learning using pretrained language models and a large dataset 
of classified articles produced models with improved specificity while 
maintaining >99% recall. The resulting DL-PLUS model identifies high-quality, 
clinically relevant articles from PubMed at the time of publication. The model 
improves the efficiency of a literature surveillance program, which allows for 
faster dissemination of appraised research.

Climate change could exacerbate extreme climate events. This study investigated 
the global and continental representations of fourteen multisectoral climate 
indices during the historical (1979-2014), near future (2025-2060) and far 
future (2065-2100) periods under two emission scenarios, in eleven Coupled Model 
Intercomparison Project (CMIP) General Circulation Models (GCM). We ranked the 
GCMs based on five metrics centred on their temporal and spatial performances. 
Most models followed the reference pattern during the historical period. MPI-ESM 
ranked best in replicating the daily precipitation intensity (DPI) in Africa, 
while CANESM5 GCM ranked first in heatwave index (HI), maximum consecutive dry 
days (MCCD). Across the different continents, MPI-LR GCM performed best in 
replicating the DPI, except in Africa. The model ranks could provide valuable 
information when selecting appropriate GCM ensembles when focusing on climate 
extremes. A global evaluation of the multi-index causal effects for the various 
indices shows that the dry spell total length (DSTL) was the most crucial index 
modulating the MCCD for all continents. Also, most indices exhibited a positive 
climate change signal from the historical to the future. Therefore, it is 
crucial to design appropriate strategies to strengthen resilience to extreme 
climatic events while mitigating greenhouse gas emissions.

Processing genome-wide association studies within a repository of heterogeneous 
genomic datasets.

Bernasconi A(#)(1), Canakoglu A(#)(2), Comolli F(2).

Erratum in
    BMC Genom Data. 2023 Jun 5;24(Suppl 1):32.

BACKGROUND: Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) are based on the observation 
of genome-wide sets of genetic variants - typically single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) - in different individuals that are associated with 
phenotypic traits. Research efforts have so far been directed to improving GWAS 
techniques rather than on making the results of GWAS interoperable with other 
genomic signals; this is currently hindered by the use of heterogeneous formats 
and uncoordinated experiment descriptions.
RESULTS: To practically facilitate integrative use, we propose to include GWAS 
datasets within the META-BASE repository, exploiting an integration pipeline 
previously studied for other genomic datasets that includes several 
heterogeneous data types in the same format, queryable from the same systems. We 
represent GWAS SNPs and metadata by means of the Genomic Data Model and include 
metadata within a relational representation by extending the Genomic Conceptual 
Model with a dedicated view. To further reduce the gap with the descriptions of 
other signals in the repository of genomic datasets, we perform a semantic 
annotation of phenotypic traits. Our pipeline is demonstrated using two 
important data sources, initially organized according to different data models: 
the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog and FinnGen (University of Helsinki). The integration 
effort finally allows us to use these datasets within multi-sample processing 
queries that respond to important biological questions. These are then made 
usable for multi-omic studies together with, e.g., somatic and reference 
mutation data, genomic annotations, epigenetic signals.
CONCLUSIONS: As a result of the our work on GWAS datasets, we enable 1) their 
interoperable use with several other homogenized and processed genomic datasets 
in the context of the META-BASE repository; 2) their big data processing by 
means of the GenoMetric Query Language and associated system. Future large-scale 
tertiary data analysis may extensively benefit from the addition of GWAS results 
to inform several different downstream analysis workflows.

Transcriptional modulation of inflammation, and aging in Indian obese adults 
following a 12-week yoga-based lifestyle intervention: A randomized controlled 
trial.

Sharma P(1), Yadav RK(1)(2), Khadgawat R(2), Dada R(3).

INTRODUCTION: Obesity is one of the major global problems in today's world, both 
in children, and the adult age group. Current evidence suggests obesity alters 
the expression of various genes related to oxidative stress, inflammation, and 
aging. In recent times complementary therapy like yoga-based lifestyle 
intervention (YBLI) is used as an adjunct therapy to modern medicine. This study 
examines the efficacy of 12 weeks of yoga-based lifestyle intervention with 
standard care (SC) on the expression of genes related to oxidative stress, 
inflammation, and aging in obese adults.
METHODS: This was a two-arm parallel randomized control trial implemented at 
Integral Health Clinic (IHC), an outpatient facility that regularly conducted 
YBLI programs for the prevention of lifestyle diseases like obesity and diabetes 
in the Department of Physiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences 
(AIIMS), New Delhi. Blood samples at baseline and weeks 2,4, and 12 were 
collected from 72 adults (male n = 21; female n = 51) of age 20-45 years with a 
body-mass index (BMI) of 25-35 kg/m2 who were randomized to receive either a 
12-week SC (n = 36) or YBLI (n = 36). SC included recommendations for the 
management of obesity as per Indian guidelines including a low-calorie 
individualized diet and physical activity. Asana (physical postures), pranayama 
(breathing exercises), and meditation were all part of the YBLI. Primary 
outcomes were relative fold change in the expression of genes associated with 
oxidative stress [Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-Kappa B)], inflammation [Tumor 
necrosis factor-α (TNFα), interleukin-6 (IL-6)], and aging [human telomerase 
reverse transcriptase (TERT)] in peripheral blood mononuclear cells between the 
two groups at week-12.
RESULTS: There were no significant changes in fold change of TERT, IL-6, and 
NF-kappa B between the groups at week 12. The relative fold change of TERT was 
significantly greater in the YBLI group (p = <0.0001) vs the SC group at 2 
weeks. The relative fold change of TNF α was significantly lower at week 12 in 
YBLI though the change was not continuous and reliable. Within both groups, TERT 
expression was significantly increased at week 2 though the change was greater 
in the YBLI group (p < 0.0001). TNF α gene expression was significantly lower at 
weeks 2 and 4, compared to baseline level, in the SC group but it increased at 
week 12.
CONCLUSION: The results while did not confirm our hypothesis, are important to 
share with the scientific society, to be able to improve prospective study 
designs and find optimal time/intervention/biological marker settings for this 
highly important scientific field. The results are suggestive of a positive 
impact of YBLI and SC on the fold change of aging-related TERT gene in obesity, 
though the benefit was not evident till week 12. However, the results should be 
evaluated with caution and in light of other published studies. To better 
understand the positive effects of YBLI on oxidative stress, inflammation, and 
aging-related gene expression in obesity, larger studies are recommended.

Predicting relations between SOAP note sections: The value of incorporating a 
clinical information model.

Socrates V(1), Gilson A(2), Lopez K(3), Chi L(4), Taylor RA(5), Chartash D(6).

Physician progress notes are frequently organized into Subjective, Objective, 
Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) sections. The Assessment section synthesizes 
information recorded in the Subjective and Objective sections, and the Plan 
section documents tests and treatments to narrow the differential diagnosis and 
manage symptoms. Classifying the relationship between the Assessment and Plan 
sections has been suggested to provide valuable insight into clinical reasoning. 
In this work, we use a novel human-in-the-loop pipeline to classify the 
relationships between the Assessment and Plan sections of SOAP notes as a part 
of the n2c2 2022 Track 3 Challenge. In particular, we use a clinical information 
model constructed from both the entailment logic expected from the 
aforementioned Challenge and the problem-oriented medical record. This 
information model is used to label named entities as primary and secondary 
problems/symptoms, events and complications in all four SOAP sections. We 
iteratively train separate Named Entity Recognition models and use them to 
annotate entities in all notes/sections. We fine-tune a downstream RoBERTa-large 
model to classify the Assessment-Plan relationship. We evaluate multiple 
language model architectures, preprocessing parameters, and methods of knowledge 
integration, achieving a maximum macro-F1 score of 82.31%. Our initial model 
achieves top-2 performance during the challenge (macro-F1: 81.52%, competitors' 
macro-F1 range: 74.54%-82.12%). We improved our model by incorporating 
post-challenge annotations (S&O sections), outperforming the top model from the 
Challenge. We also used Shapley additive explanations to investigate the extent 
of language model clinical logic, under the lens of our clinical information 
model. We find that the model often uses shallow heuristics and nonspecific 
attention when making predictions, suggesting language model knowledge 
integration requires further research.

Dose-Dependent Glucocorticoid Regulation of Transcription Factors in Vocal Fold 
Fibroblasts and Macrophages.

Nakamura R(1), Bing R(1), Gartling GJ(1), Garabedian MJ(2), Branski RC(1)(3).

OBJECTIVE: Variable outcomes of glucocorticoid (GC) therapy for laryngeal 
disease are putatively due to diverse interactions of the GC receptor (GR) with 
cell signaling pathways, limited consideration regarding concentration-dependent 
effects, and inconsistent selection of GCs. In the current study, we evaluated 
the concentration-dependent effects of three frequently administered GCs on 
transcription factors with an emphasis on the phosphorylation of GR at Ser203 
and Ser211 regulating the nuclear translocation of GR. This study provides 
foundational data regarding the diverse functions of GCs to optimize therapeutic 
approaches.
STUDY DESIGN: In vitro.
METHODS: Human vocal fold fibroblasts and THP1-derived macrophages were treated 
with different concentrations of dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, and 
triamcinolone in combination with IFN-γ, TNF-α, or IL4. Phosphorylated STAT1, 
NF-κB family molecules, and phosphorylated STAT6 were analyzed by Western 
blotting. Ser211-phosphorylated GR (S211-pGR) levels relative to GAPDH and 
Ser203-phosphorylated GR (S203-pGR) were also analyzed.
RESULTS: GCs differentially altered phosphorylated STAT1 and NF-κB family 
molecules in different cell types under IFN-γ and TNF-α stimuli. GCs did not 
alter phosphorylated STAT6 in IL4-treated macrophages. The three GCs were nearly 
equivalent. A lower concentration of dexamethasone increased S211-pGR/GAPDH 
ratios relative to increased S211-pGR/S203-pGR ratios regardless of cell type 
and treatment.
CONCLUSION: The three GCs employed in two cell lines had nearly equivalent 
effects on transcription factor regulation. Relatively high levels of 
Ser203-phosphorylation at low GC concentrations may be related to 
concentration-dependent differential effects of GCs in the two cell lines.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: NA Laryngoscope, 2023.

Taurine rescues pancreatic β-cell stress by stimulating α-cell 
transdifferentiation.

Sarnobat D(1), Moffett RC(1), Ma J(2), Flatt PR(1), McClenaghan NH(1)(3), 
Tarasov AI(1).

The semi-essential ubiquitous amino acid taurine has been shown to alleviate 
obesity and hyperglycemia in humans; however, the pathways underlying the 
antidiabetic actions have not been characterized. We explored the effect of 
chronic taurine exposure on cell biology of pancreatic islets, in degenerative 
type 1-like diabetes. The latter was modeled by small dose of streptozotocin 
(STZ) injection for 5 days in mice, followed by a 10-day administration of 
taurine (2% w/v, orally) in the drinking water. Taurine treatment opposed the 
detrimental changes in islet morphology and β-/α-cell ratio, induced by STZ 
diabetes, coincidentally with a significant 3.9 ± 0.7-fold enhancement of 
proliferation and 40 ± 5% reduction of apoptosis in β-cells. In line with these 
findings, the treatment counteracted an upregulation of antioxidant (Sod1, Sod2, 
Cat, Gpx1) and downregulation of islet expansion (Ngn3, Itgb1) genes induced by 
STZ, in a pancreatic β-cell line. At the same time, taurine enhanced the 
transdifferentiation of α-cells into β-cells by 2.3 ± 0.8-fold, echoed in strong 
non-metabolic elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ levels in pancreatic α-cells. Our data 
suggest a bimodal effect of dietary taurine on islet β-cell biology, which 
combines the augmentation of α-/β-cell transdifferentiation with downregulation 
of apoptosis. The dualism of action, stemming presumably from the intra- and 
extracellular modality of the signal, is likely to explain the antidiabetic 
potential of taurine supplementation.

Could eggshell membrane be an adjuvant for recombinant Hepatitis B vaccine?: A 
preliminary investigation.

Joshua PE(1), Ilo CC(1), Ukachukwu UG(1), Odimegwu DC(2), Asomadu RO(1), Ezeorba 
TPC(1)(3)(4).

BACKGROUND: Despite the invasiveness of the Hepatitis B infection, its vaccines 
are only formulated with FDA-approved alum-based adjuvants, which poorly elicit 
a lasting immune response, hence the need for a more effective adjuvant system. 
This study evaluated the immunogenicity and toxicity of eggshell membranes (ESM) 
when administered as an adjuvant for the recombinant HBV vaccine (rHBsAg) in 
albino mice. Differential white blood cell analysis, as well as the titer 
measurement of Immunoglobulin G, subclass G1 and G2a on indirect ELISA, was 
performed to measure the immune-modulatory potentials of ESM. Moreover, analysis 
of the liver marker enzyme (AST and ALT) and body/liver weights was performed to 
ascertain the toxicity level of ESM. Finally, Immuno-informatic analysis was 
used to investigate the immune-modulatory potential of individual member 
proteins of ESM.
RESULTS: Our results showed a significant improvement in the experimental 
group's lymphocyte count after boost-dose administration compared to the 
controls, whereas there was no significant change in the granulocyte population. 
Furthermore, the formulations (ESM-rHBsAg) significantly improved IgG and IgG1 
titers after each successive immunization. Body/liver weight and liver function 
showed ESM non-toxic to mice. The immunoinformatic analysis discovered 
ovalbumin, lysozyme-C, and UFM-1 as the member proteins of ESM with 
immune-modulatory activities of activating antigen-presenting cells (APC).
CONCLUSION: This study has provided a clue into the potential valorization of 
eggshell membranes and their peptides as an adjuvant for vaccines such as HBV. 
We recommend more in-depth molecular analysis to support our findings as well as 
foster real-life application.

Sex differences in resting state functional connectivity across the first two 
years of life.

Fenske SJ(1), Liu J(2), Chen H(3), Diniz MA(4), Stephens RL(5), Cornea E(6), 
Gilmore JH(7), Gao W(8).

Sex differences in behavior have been reported from infancy through adulthood, 
but little is known about sex effects on functional circuitry in early infancy. 
Moreover, the relationship between early sex effects on the functional 
architecture of the brain and later behavioral performance remains to be 
elucidated. In this study, we used resting-state fMRI and a novel heatmap 
analysis to examine sex differences in functional connectivity with 
cross-sectional and longitudinal mixed models in a large cohort of infants 
(n = 319 neonates, 1-, and 2-year-olds). An adult dataset (n = 92) was also 
included for comparison. We investigated the relationship between sex 
differences in functional circuitry and later measures of language (collected in 
1- and 2-year-olds) as well as indices of anxiety, executive function, and 
intelligence (collected in 4-year-olds). Brain areas showing the most 
significant sex differences were age-specific across infancy, with two temporal 
regions demonstrating consistent differences. Measures of functional 
connectivity showing sex differences in infancy were significantly associated 
with subsequent behavioral scores of language, executive function, and 
intelligence. Our findings provide insights into the effects of sex on dynamic 
neurodevelopmental trajectories during infancy and lay an important foundation 
for understanding the mechanisms underlying sex differences in health and 
disease.

Investigating the in vitro mode of action of okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) as 
hypocholesterolemic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant food.

Panighel G(1), Ferrarese I(1), Lupo MG(2), Sut S(1), Dall'Acqua S(1), Ferri 
N(2).

Okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) have been introduced as food relatively recently 
in Europe. It is native to India and one of the most important vegetables in 
Nigeria. The leaves can be consumed but also the fruit is rich in nutrients and 
bioactive compounds (i.e., dietary fiber, vitamins, oils, polysaccharides, 
polyphenols) and several health promoting actions have been ascribed, including 
a lipid-lowering properties. In this work the effects of fruit and leaf extracts 
on expression of key mediators of cholesterol metabolism, i.e., the low-density 
lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 
(PCSK9), were investigated in human hepatoma cell line Huh7. Furthermore, 
effects on proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α) expressed by 
THP1-derived macrophages were studied to assess potential anti-inflammatory 
actions. Okra fruit extract significantly induced the mRNA and protein levels of 
the LDLR by 1.4 ± 0.3 and 4.8 ± 1.5-fold, respectively without any significant 
modification of PCSK9 expression. In addition, fruit extract showed a 
significant sequestering ability of cholic acid. Leaf butanol extract exerted 
similar action by inducing the expression of both the LDLR (+3.1 ± 1.6-fold vs 
control) and PCSK9 (+1.3 ± 0.4-fold vs control). The evaluation of the potential 
anti-inflammatory effect revealed a significant action of leaf butanol extract 
with reduced mRNA levels of IL-1β (-28 ± 8 % vs control), IL-6 (-11 ± 1 % vs 
control) and TNF-α (-43 ± 8 % vs control), while fruit extract did not show any 
anti-inflammatory activity. Finally, leaf ethyl acetate extract showed a 
significant antioxidant capacity comparable to ascorbic acid. Taken together, we 
provided evidence that leaf butanol extract and, more effectively, fruit extract 
induced the LDLR expression, effect that may explain the previously reported 
hypocholesterolemic action of okra. In addition, okra's extracts reduced the 
expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines from THP1-derived macrophages, an 
effect that may suggest a vascular protective action of okra.

Beta cell regeneration upon magainin and growth hormone treatment as a possible 
alternative to insulin therapy.

Moosavi A(1), Yazdanparast R(1).

Insulin therapy, pancreas transplantation and β cell regeneration are among the 
suggested treatment strategies for type 1 diabetes. It has been shown that some 
antimicrobial peptides have the potential to increase insulin release and to 
improve glucose tolerance, although the mechanism by which they promote the 
regeneration of damaged pancreatic cells to functional β-like cells remains 
unknown. To answer this question, we evaluated the in vivo effects of 
magainin-AM2 and growth hormone (GH) on the regeneration of streptozotocin 
(STZ)-damaged mouse pancreas. Treatment with magainin-AM2 and GH ameliorated the 
effects of STZ on fasting blood glucose and glucose tolerance test values, and 
also resulted in a significant increase in total cell counts (α and β) and the 
number of insulin+ and glucagon+ cells per islet and a decrease in the number of 
T and B cells. In addition, we observed a 1.43- and 2.21-fold increase in 
expression of paired box 4, one of the main factors for α to β-like cell 
conversion, in normal- and diabetes-treated mice, respectively. Similarly, 
expression of P-S6 and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2, required 
for cell proliferation/differentiation, increased by 3.27- and 2.19-fold among 
the diabetes-treated and control diabetic mice, respectively. Furthermore, in 
all experiments, amelioration of the effects of STZ were greatest upon Mag 
treatment followed by GH administration. The present in vivo data provide 
evidence in support of the possibility of pharmaceutical induction of α cell 
production and their trans-differentiation to functional β-like cells.

A stacking ensemble machine learning model to predict alpha-1 antitrypsin 
deficiency-associated liver disease clinical outcomes based on UK Biobank data.

Meng L(1), Treem W(2), Heap GA(2), Chen J(3).

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency associated liver disease (AATD-LD) is a rare 
genetic disorder and not well-recognized. Predicting the clinical outcomes of 
AATD-LD and defining patients more likely to progress to advanced liver disease 
are crucial for better understanding AATD-LD progression and promoting timely 
medical intervention. We aimed to develop a tailored machine learning (ML) model 
to predict the disease progression of AATD-LD. This analysis was conducted 
through a stacking ensemble learning model by combining five different ML 
algorithms with 58 predictor variables using nested five-fold cross-validation 
with repetitions based on the UK Biobank data. Performance of the model was 
assessed through prediction accuracy, area under the receiver operating 
characteristic (AUROC), and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). The 
importance of predictor contributions was evaluated through a feature importance 
permutation method. The proposed stacking ensemble ML model showed clinically 
meaningful accuracy and appeared superior to any single ML algorithms in the 
ensemble, e.g., the AUROC for AATD-LD was 68.1%, 75.9%, 91.2%, and 67.7% for 
all-cause mortality, liver-related death, liver transplant, and all-cause 
mortality or liver transplant, respectively. This work supports the use of ML to 
address the unanswered clinical questions with clinically meaningful accuracy 
using real-world data.

Ferroelectricity and Piezoelectricity in 2D Van der Waals CuInP(2)S(6) 
Ferroelectric Tunnel Junctions.

Yue W(1)(4), Kimura H(5), Yao Y(3), Yu S(1), Guo Q(2), Cheng Z(6).

CuInP2S6 (CIPS) is a novel two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) 
ferroelectric layered material with a Curie temperature of TC~315 K, making it 
promising for great potential applications in electronic and photoelectric 
devices. Herein, the ferroelectric and electric properties of CIPS at different 
thicknesses are carefully evaluated by scanning probe microscopy techniques. 
Some defects in some local regions due to Cu deficiency lead to a 
CuInP2S6-In4/3P2S6 (CIPS-IPS) paraelectric phase coexisting with the CIPS 
ferroelectric phase. An electrochemical strain microscopy (ESM) study reveals 
that the relaxation times corresponding to the Cu ions and the IPS ionospheres 
are not the same, with a significant difference in their response to DC voltage, 
related to the rectification effect of the ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ). 
The electric properties of the FTJ indicate Cu+ ion migration and propose that 
the current flow and device performance are dynamically controlled by an 
interfacial Schottky barrier. The addition of the ferroelectricity of CIPS opens 
up applications in memories and sensors, actuators, and even spin-orbit devices 
based on 2D vdW heterostructures.

Higher Serum Endothelial-Specific Molecule-1 (ESM-1/Endocan) Levels are 
Associated with Poor Pathological Outcomes in Primary Bladder Cancer: A 
Non-randomized, Prospective, Case-Control Study.

Okucu E(1), Yucetas U(1), Karsiyakali N(2), Koseoglu H(1), Yucetas E(3), Erkan 
E(1), Kadihasanoglu M(1), Toktas MG(1).

AIM: To compare serum endothelial-specific molecule-1 (ESM-1 or endocan) levels 
between individuals with primary bladder cancer (BC) who have various 
pathological features of BC and healthy volunteers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 154 consecutive patients with primary BC (Group-1) and 52 
healthy volunteers (Group-2) were accepted into this prospective, 
non-randomized, observational research between January 2017 and December 2018. 
Peripheral blood samples were obtained from each participant to measure serum 
ESM-1/endocan levels. Group-1 was further divided into subgroups as Group-1A 
(pTa), Group-1B (pT1) and Group-1C (pT2) based on the transurethral resection of 
bladder tumour (TURBT) histopathological results. In addition Group-1 was 
divided into other subgroups based on pathological features of BC including 
tumor grade, tumor volume and muscle-invasive status. Groups were compared 
statistically regarding ESM-1/endocan levels.
RESULTS: Median age of the individuals was 63 (22) years in Group-1 and 66 (11) 
years in Group-2 (p = 0.051). There were 140 (90.9%) males and 14 (9.1%) females 
in Group-1 and 30 (57.7%) males and 22 (42.3%) females in Group-2 (p < 0.001). 
The serum ESM-1/endocan measurements were lower in Group-2 than in Group-1 (p = 
0.018). Of the patients in Group-1, 62 (40.3%) had low-grade tumors and 92 
(59.7%) had high-grade tumors. When Group-1 was further divided into other 
subgroups according to different pathological features of BC such as tumor 
stage, grade, muscle-invasive status and tumor volume it was detected that there 
was a statistically meaningful difference between all subgroups of Group-1 and 
Group-2 in terms of serum ESM-1/endocan levels (p < 0.05 for each). The serum 
ESM-1/endocan cut-off value (3.472 ng/mL) had a specificity of 57.7%, 
sensitivity of 59.1%, NPV (negative predictive value) of 32.3% and PPV (positive 
predictive value) of 80.5% for predicting the presence of BC with an AUC (Area 
Under the Curve) of 0.609 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.524-0.694; p = 0.018).
CONCLUSIONS: The serum ESM-1/endocan levels can be considered a potentially 
useful predictor for BC. Higher serum ESM-1/endocan levels are related with poor 
pathological outcomes in BC.

Dynamic Individual Risk Networks: Personalized Network Modelling Based on 
Experience Sampling Data.

Smid WJ(1), Wever EC(1), Van den Heuvel N(1).

Following a network perspective, risk of sexual reoffending can be understood as 
a construct that emerges from the interactions between risk factors. If these 
interrelationships are validly mapped out, this leads to an increased 
understanding of the risk and thus may contribute to more effective and/or more 
efficient interventions. This paper reports on personalized network modeling 
mapping the interrelationships of dynamic risk factors for an individual 
convicted of sexual offenses, using experience sampling (ESM) based on 
Stable-2007 items. The longitudinal character of ESM enables both the assessment 
of interrelations between risk factors within a timeframe and the relationships 
between risk factors over time. Networks are calculated and compared to the 
clinical assessment of interrelationships between the risk factors.

Content and sentiment surveillance (CSI): A critical component for modeling 
modern epidemics.

Chen S(1)(2)(3), Yin SJ(4), Guo Y(2)(5), Ge Y(4), Janies D(6), Dulin M(1)(3), 
Brown C(2)(7), Robinson P(1)(3), Zhang D(2)(8).

Comprehensive surveillance systems are the key to provide accurate data for 
effective modeling. Traditional symptom-based case surveillance has been joined 
with recent genomic, serologic, and environment surveillance to provide more 
integrated disease surveillance systems. A major gap in comprehensive disease 
surveillance is to accurately monitor potential population behavioral changes in 
real-time. Population-wide behaviors such as compliance with various 
interventions and vaccination acceptance significantly influence and drive the 
overall epidemic dynamics in the society. Original infoveillance utilizes online 
query data (e.g., Google and Wikipedia search of a specific content topic such 
as an epidemic) and later focuses on large volumes of online discourse data 
about the from social media platforms and further augments epidemic modeling. It 
mainly uses number of posts to approximate public awareness of the disease, and 
further compares with observed epidemic dynamics for better projection. The 
current COVID-19 pandemic shows that there is an urgency to further harness the 
rich, detailed content and sentiment information, which can provide more 
accurate and granular information on public awareness and perceptions toward 
multiple aspects of the disease, especially various interventions. In this 
perspective paper, we describe a novel conceptual analytical framework of 
content and sentiment infoveillance (CSI) and integration with epidemic 
modeling. This CSI framework includes data retrieval and pre-processing; 
information extraction via natural language processing to identify and quantify 
detailed time, location, content, and sentiment information; and integrating 
infoveillance with common epidemic modeling techniques of both mechanistic and 
data-driven methods. CSI complements and significantly enhances current epidemic 
models for more informed decision by integrating behavioral aspects from 
detailed, instantaneous infoveillance from massive social media data.

Applying multiverse analysis to experience sampling data: Investigating whether 
preprocessing choices affect robustness of conclusions.

Weermeijer J(1), Lafit G(#)(2)(3), Kiekens G(#)(2)(4), Wampers M(2), Eisele 
G(2), Kasanova Z(2), Vaessen T(2), Kuppens P(3), Myin-Germeys I(2).

The experience sampling method (ESM) has revolutionized our ability to conduct 
psychological research in the natural environment. However, researchers have a 
large degree of freedom when preprocessing ESM data, which may hinder scientific 
progress. This study illustrates the use of multiverse analyses regarding 
preprocessing choices related to data exclusion (i.e., based on various levels 
of compliance and exclusion of the first assessment day) and the calculation of 
constructs (i.e., composite scores calculated as the mean, median, or mode) by 
reanalyzing established group differences in negative affect, stress reactivity, 
and emotional inertia between individuals with and without psychosis. Data came 
from five studies and included 233 individuals with psychosis and 223 healthy 
individuals (in total, 26,892 longitudinal assessments). Preprocessing choices 
related to data exclusion did not affect conclusions. For both stress reactivity 
and emotional inertia of negative affect, group differences were affected when 
negative affect was calculated as the mean compared to the median or mode. 
Further analyses revealed that this could be attributed to considerable 
differences in the within- and between-factor structure of negative affect. 
While these findings show that observed differences in affective processes 
between individuals with and without psychosis are robust to preprocessing 
choices related to data exclusion, we found disagreement in conclusions between 
different central tendency measures. Safeguarding the validity of future 
experience sampling research, scholars are advised to use multiverse analysis to

Hüpen P(1)(2), Kumar H(3), Shymanskaya A(1), Swaminathan R(3), Habel U(1)(4).

Impulsivity is a multidimensional construct often associated with unfavorable 
outcomes. Previous studies have implicated several electroencephalography (EEG) 
indices to impulsiveness, but results are heterogeneous and inconsistent. Using 
a data-driven approach, we identified EEG power features for the prediction of 
self-reported impulsiveness. To this end, EEG signals of 56 individuals (18 low 
impulsive, 20 intermediate impulsive, 18 high impulsive) were recorded during a 
risk-taking task. Extracted EEG power features from 62 electrodes were fed into 
various machine learning classifiers to identify the most relevant band. 
Robustness of the classifier was varied by stratified [Formula: see text]-fold 
cross validation. Alpha and beta band power showed best performance in the 
classification of impulsiveness (accuracy = 95.18% and 95.11%, respectively) 
using a random forest classifier. Subsequently, a sequential bidirectional 
feature selection algorithm was used to estimate the most relevant electrode 
sites. Results show that as little as 10 electrodes are sufficient to reliably 
classify impulsiveness using alpha band power ([Formula: see text]-measure = 
94.50%). Finally, the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis approach was 
employed to reveal the individual EEG features that contributed most to the 
model's output. Results indicate that frontal as well as posterior midline alpha 
power seems to be of most importance for the classification of impulsiveness.

Arabidopsis.

The voltage-gated potassium channel AKT1 is responsible for primary K+ uptake in 
Arabidopsis roots. AKT1 is functionally activated through phosphorylation and 
negatively regulated by a potassium channel α-subunit AtKC1. However, the 
molecular basis for the modulation mechanism remains unclear. Here we report the 
structures of AKT1, phosphorylated-AKT1, a constitutively-active variant, and 
AKT1-AtKC1 complex. AKT1 is assembled in 2-fold symmetry at the cytoplasmic 
domain. Such organization appears to sterically hinder the reorientation of 
C-linkers during ion permeation. Phosphorylated-AKT1 adopts an alternate 4-fold 
symmetric conformation at cytoplasmic domain, which indicates conformational 
changes associated with symmetry switch during channel activation. To 
corroborate this finding, we perform structure-guided mutagenesis to disrupt the 
dimeric interface and identify a constitutively-active variant Asp379Ala 
mediates K+ permeation independently of phosphorylation. This variant 
predominantly adopts a 4-fold symmetric conformation. Furthermore, the 
AKT1-AtKC1 complex assembles in 2-fold symmetry. Together, our work reveals 
structural insight into the regulatory mechanism for AKT1.

Climate change multi-model projections in CMIP6 scenarios in Central Hokkaido, 
Japan.

Peng S(1)(2), Wang C(3), Li Z(4), Mihara K(2), Kuramochi K(2), Toma Y(2), Hatano 
R(2).

Simulation of future climate changes, especially temperature and rainfall, is 
critical for water resource management, disaster mitigation, and agricultural 
development. Based on the category-wise indicator method, two preferred Global 
Climate Models (GCMs) for the Ishikari River basin (IRB), the socio-economic 
center of Hokkaido, Japan, were examined from the newly released Coupled Model 
Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). Climatic variables (maximum/minimum 
temperature and precipitation) were projected by the Statistical DownScaling 
Model (SDSM) under all shared socioeconomic pathway-representative concentration 
pathway (SSP-RCP) scenarios (SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP4-3.4, 
SSP4-6.0, SSP5-3.4OS, and SSP5-8.5) in two phases: 2040-2069 (2040s) and 
2070-2099 (2070s), with the period of 1985-2014 as the baseline. Predictors of 
SDSM were derived from CMIP6 GCMs and the reanalysis dataset NOAA-CIRES-DOE 20th 
Century Reanalysis V3 (20CRv3). Results showed that CMIP6 GCMs had a significant 
correlation with temperature measurements, but could not represent precipitation 
features in the IRB. The constructed SDSM could capture the characteristics of 
temperature and precipitation during the calibration (1985-1999) and validation 
(2000-2014) phases, respectively. The selected GCMs (MIROC6 and MRI-ESM-2.0) 
generated higher temperature and less rainfall in the forthcoming phases. The 
SSP-RCP scenarios had an apparent influence on temperature and precipitation. 
High-emission scenarios (i.e., SSP5-8.5) would project a higher temperature and 
lower rainfall than the low-emission scenarios (e.g., SSP1-1.9). 
Spatial-temporal analysis indicated that the northern part of the IRB is more 
likely to become warmer with heavier precipitation than the southern part in the 
future. Higher temperature and lower rainfall were projected throughout the late 
twenty-first century (2070s) than the mid-century (2040s) in the IRB. The 
findings of this study could be further used to predict the hydrological cycle 
and assess the ecosystem's sustainability.

P2Y(2)R‑mediated transactivation of VEGFR2 through Src phosphorylation is 
associated with ESM‑1 overexpression in radiotherapy‑resistant‑triple negative 
breast cancer cells.

Jin H(1), Ko YS(1), Yun SP(1), Park SW(1), Kim HJ(1).

We previously reported that radiotherapy‑resistant (RT‑R) triple negative breast 
cancer (TNBC) cells upregulate the expression of endothelial‑specific molecule‑1 
(ESM‑1) compared with TNBC cells. In addition, ESM‑1 is involved in an increased 
proliferation and invasion of RT‑R‑TNBC cells compared with TNBC cells. It was 
further identified that, in RT‑R‑TNBC cells, P2Y2 purinergic receptor 
(P2Y2R)‑mediated activation of p21‑activated kinase 1 (PAK1), protein kinase C 
(PKC), c‑Jun N‑terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPKs is related to ESM‑1 
expression via forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) regulation. Notably, it has been reported 
that P2Y2R mediates the transactivation of vascular epithelial growth factor 
receptor 2 (VEGFR2), and VEGFR2 is known to be involved in ESM‑1 expression. 
Therefore, in the present study, the involvement of VEGFR2 in the P2Y2R‑mediated 
ESM‑1 upregulation in RT‑R‑TNBC cells and the relationship between P2Y2R and 
VEGFR2 activation was further examined. Western blotting and reverse 
transcription‑PCR were used to monitor the expression of ESM‑1, and the results 
demonstrated that extracellular ATP treatment regulated the expression of ESM‑1 
in a P2Y2R‑dependent manner in RT‑R‑MDA‑MB‑231 cells. In addition, extracellular 
ATP activated Src and VEGFR2 after 5 min of incubation, which was abolished by 
knockdown of P2Y2R expression. VEGFR2 activation in response to ATP was also 
decreased by inhibiting Src activity, suggesting that ATP‑activated P2Y2R 
regulates VEGFR2 phosphorylation via Src activation. Furthermore, ATP‑induced 
ESM‑1 expression was decreased by transfection with VEGFR2 small interfering RNA 
(siRNA). ESM‑1‑related signaling molecules, PAK1, PKC, JNK and p38 MAPKs, and 
the transcriptional regulator, FoxO1, which were activated by ATP, were also 
decreased following transfection with VEGFR2 siRNA. These results suggest that 
P2Y2R‑mediated transactivation of VEGFR2 through Src phosphorylation is 
associated with ESM‑1 overexpression in RT‑R‑TNBC cells.

Linking green supply chain management practices with competitiveness during 
covid 19: The role of big data analytics.

Zhang Q(1), Gao B(1), Luqman A(1).

Although the global green supply chain management (GSCM) practice has attracted 
considerable scholarly attention, its efficacy for environmental management 
systems (EMS) and market competitiveness during Covid-19 has not been fully 
capitalized. Therefore, the existing literature indicates that the important 
link between GSCM, EMS, and market competitiveness is missing as supply 
management is crucial to maintaining market competitiveness. To fill this 
research gap, the current study examines whether EMS affects the relationship 
between GSCM practices and market competitiveness. We also propose the 
moderating role of big data analytics and artificial intelligence (BDA-AI) and 
environmental visibility on these associations from a Covid-19 perspective. We 
tested a proposed model using the primary data (N = 283) from regression-based 
structural equation modeling (SEM). The results provide empirical support for 
the impact of GSCM on ESM and market competitiveness. Furthermore, the results 
show that BDA-AI and environmental visibility strengthen the positive 
relationship between GSCM-EMS and EMS and market competitiveness, respectively. 
Current research provides thoughtful insights for supply chain practitioners, 
policymakers, managers, and academics that organizations should opt for formal 
EMS, BDA-AI, and environmental visibility to achieve market competitiveness, 
even in times of crisis such as Covid-19.

Extraction of microRNA-target interaction sentences from biomedical literature 
by deep learning approach.

Luo M(1), Li S(2), Pang Y(3), Yao L(3), Ma R(4), Huang HY(5), Huang HD(6), Lee 
TY(7).

MicroRNA (miRNA)-target interaction (MTI) plays a substantial role in various 
cell activities, molecular regulations and physiological processes. Published 
biomedical literature is the carrier of high-confidence MTI knowledge. However, 
digging out this knowledge in an efficient manner from large-scale published 
articles remains challenging. To address this issue, we were motivated to 
construct a deep learning-based model. We applied the pre-trained language 
models to biomedical text to obtain the representation, and subsequently fed 
them into a deep neural network with gate mechanism layers and a fully connected 
layer for the extraction of MTI information sentences. Performances of the 
proposed models were evaluated using two datasets constructed on the basis of 
text data obtained from miRTarBase. The validation and test results revealed 
that incorporating both PubMedBERT and SciBERT for sentence level encoding with 
the long short-term memory (LSTM)-based deep neural network can yield an 
outstanding performance, with both F1 and accuracy being higher than 80% on 
validation data and test data. Additionally, the proposed deep learning method 
outperformed the following machine learning methods: random forest, support 
vector machine, logistic regression and bidirectional LSTM. This work would 
greatly facilitate studies on MTI analysis and regulations. It is anticipated 
that this work can assist in large-scale screening of miRNAs, thereby revealing 
their functional roles in various diseases, which is important for the 
development of highly specific drugs with fewer side effects. Source code and 
corpus are publicly available at https://github.com/qi29.

The Ogden model for hydrogels in tissue engineering: Modulus determination with 
compression to failure.

Nedrelow DS(1), Townsend JM(1), Detamore MS(2).

Hydrogel mechanical properties for tissue engineering are often reported in 
terms of a compressive elastic modulus derived from a linear regression of a 
typically non-linear stress-strain plot. There is a need for an alternative 
model to fit the full strain range of tissue engineering hydrogels. Fortunately, 
the Ogden model provides a shear modulus, μ0, and a nonlinear parameter, α, for 
routine analysis of compression to failure. Three example hydrogels were tested: 
(1) pentenoate-modified hyaluronic acid (PHA), (2) dual-crosslinked PHA and 
polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PHA-PEGDA), and (3) composite PHA-PEGDA hydrogel 
with cryoground devitalized cartilage (DVC) at 5, 10, and 15%w/v concentration 
(DVC5, DVC10, and DVC15, respectively). Gene expression analyses suggested that 
the DVC hydrogels supported chondrogenesis of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem 
cells to some degree. Both linear regression (5 to 15% strain) and Ogden fits 
(to failure) were performed. The compressive elastic modulus, E, was over 4-fold 
higher in the DVC15 group relative to the PHA group (129 kPa). Similarly, the 
shear modulus, μ0, was over 3-fold higher in the DVC15 group relative to the PHA 
group (37 kPa). The PHA group exhibited a much higher degree of nonlinearity 
(α = 10) compared to the DVC15 group (α = 1.4). DVC hydrogels may provide 
baseline targets of μ0 and α for future cartilage tissue engineering studies. 
The Ogden model was demonstrated to fit the full strain range with high accuracy 
(R2 = 0.998 ± 0.001) and to quantify nonlinearity. The current study provides an 
Ogden model as an attractive alternative to the elastic modulus for tissue 
engineering constructs.

Chinese patients.

Ma H(1), Hu M(1), Wan J(2)(3).

AIMS: To evaluate the reliability and validity of the Chinese version of the 
Kidney Transplant Understanding Tool (K-TUT) among patients in China.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
METHODS: A convenience sample of 171 kidney transplant (KT) candidates and 272 
KT recipients was recruited from two tertiary and Grade A hospitals in Hunan 
Province, China. The reliability was calculated by half-fold reliability, 
test-retest reliability and Cronbach's alpha. The validity was analysed by the 
content validity index.
RESULTS: For KT candidates, the Chinese version of K-TUT deleted items 4, 6, 7 
and 8, Cronbach's α coefficient was 0.778, half-fold reliability values were 
0.792, and test-retest reliability values were 0.902. For KT recipients, the 
tool deleted items 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8, Cronbach's α coefficient was 0.769, 
half-fold coefficient values were 0.701, and retest coefficient values were 
0.888. The content validity index was 0.967.
CONCLUSIONS: The K-TUT is an acceptable and reliable measurement for evaluating 
the relevant knowledge of KT recipients and candidates.
IMPACT: It is anticipated that this new tool will help the nursing staff to 
identify specific areas of deficiency that could be targeted in health education 
to improve the KT knowledge of patients.

Targeting hormone-resistant breast cancer cells with docetaxel: a look inside 
the resistance.

Scherbakov AM(1), Basharina AA(2), Sorokin DV(1), Mikhaevich EI(1), Mizaeva 
IE(2), Mikhaylova AL(1), Bogush TA(2), Krasil'nikov MA(1).

Aim: The study aims to analyze the effect of long-term incubation of 
ERα-positive MCF7 breast cancer cells with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (HT) on their 
sensitivity to tubulin polymerization inhibitor docetaxel. Methods: The analysis 
of cell viability was performed by the MTT method. The expression of signaling 
proteins was analyzed by immunoblotting and flow cytometry. ERα activity was 
evaluated by gene reporter assay. To establish hormone-resistant subline MCF7, 
breast cancer cells were treated with 4-hydroxytamoxifen for 12 months. Results: 
The developed MCF7/HT subline has lost sensitivity to 4-hydroxytamoxifen, and 
the resistance index was 2. Increased Akt activity (2.2-fold) and decreased ERα 
expression (1.5-fold) were revealed in MCF7/HT cells. The activity of the 
estrogen receptor α was reduced (1.5-fold) in MCF7/HT. Evaluation of class III 
β-tubulin expression (TUBB3), a marker associated with metastasis, revealed the 
following trends: higher expression of TUBB3 was detected in triple-negative 
breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells compared to hormone-responsive MCF7 cells (P < 
0.05). The lowest expression of TUBB3 was found in hormone-resistant MCF7/HT 
cells (MCF7/HT < MCF7 < MDA-MB-231, approximately 1:2:4). High TUBB3 expression 
strongly correlated with docetaxel resistance: IC50 value of docetaxel for 
MDA-MB-231 cells was greater than that for MCF7 cells, whereas resistant MCF7/HT 
cells were the most sensitive to the drug. The accumulation of cleaved PARP (a 
1.6-fold increase) and Bcl-2 downregulation (1.8-fold) were more pronounced in 
docetaxel-treated resistant cells (P < 0.05). The expression of cyclin D1 
decreased (2.8-fold) only in resistant cells after 4 nM docetaxel treatment, 
while this marker was unchanged in parental MCF7 breast cancer cells. 
Conclusion: Further development of taxane-based chemotherapy for 
hormone-resistant cancer looks highly promising, especially for cancers with low 
TUBB3 expression.

DeepCausality: A general AI-powered causal inference framework for free text: A 
case study of LiverTox.

Wang X(1), Xu X(1), Tong W(2), Liu Q(3), Liu Z(2).

Causality plays an essential role in multiple scientific disciplines, including 
the social, behavioral, and biological sciences and portions of statistics and 
artificial intelligence. Manual-based causality assessment from a large number 
of free text-based documents is very time-consuming, labor-intensive, and 
sometimes even impractical. Herein, we proposed a general causal inference 
framework named DeepCausality to empirically estimate the causal factors for 
suspected endpoints embedded in the free text. The proposed DeepCausality 
seamlessly incorporates AI-powered language models, named entity recognition and 
Judea Pearl's Do-calculus, into a general framework for causal inference to 
fulfill different domain-specific applications. We exemplified the utility of 
the proposed DeepCausality framework by employing the LiverTox database to 
estimate idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (DILI)-related causal terms and 
generate a knowledge-based causal tree for idiosyncratic DILI patient 
stratification. Consequently, the DeepCausality yielded a prediction performance 
with an accuracy of 0.92 and an F-score of 0.84 for the DILI prediction. 
Notably, 90% of causal terms enriched by the DeepCausality were consistent with 
the clinical causal terms defined by the American College of Gastroenterology 
(ACG) clinical guideline for evaluating suspected idiosyncratic DILI (iDILI). 
Furthermore, we observed a high concordance of 0.91 between the iDILI severity 
scores generated by DeepCausality and domain experts. Altogether, the proposed 
DeepCausality framework could be a promising solution for causality assessment 
from free text and is publicly available through

Excessive enterprise social media usage and employee creativity: An application 
of the transactional theory of stress and coping.

Si W(1), Khan NA(2), Ali M(3), Amin MW(4), Pan Q(5).

This study proposed a research model based on the transactional theory of stress 
and coping to examine the relationship between excessive enterprise social media 
(ESM) usage and employee creativity. The research model proposed that excessive 
ESM usage positively influences Techno-overload and technology-family conflict 
which influence ESM fatigue. Furthermore, ESM fatigue negatively influences 
employee creativity. The model was tested using a sample of 367 individual 
employees from the information technology industry in China. Results reveal that 
excessive ESM usage is significantly related to employees' perceptions of 
Techno-overload and technology-family conflict which contribute to generating 
ESM fatigue. Results further reveal that ESM fatigue is negatively related to 
employee creativity. The contributions of this research to the theory and 
practice are discussed in the later section.

Temporal associations between trauma-related sleep disturbances and PTSD 
symptoms: An experience sampling study.

Werner GG(1), Göhre I(1), Takano K(1), Ehring T(1), Wittekind CE(1), Stefanovic 
M(1).

OBJECTIVE: There is robust evidence for the influence of sleep disturbances on 
the maintenance of PTSD symptoms. However, little is known about day-to-day 
variation in trauma-related sleep disturbances (namely insomnia symptoms and 
nightmares) and their associations with PTSD symptoms. Therefore, we explored 
the dynamic interplay of these symptoms in daily life using an experience 
sampling method (ESM).
METHOD: For 15 consecutive days, participants with PTSD symptomatology as 
primary complaint (N = 48) reported momentary levels of insomnia symptoms and 
nightmares as well as PTSD symptoms via a mobile app.
RESULTS: Multilevel model analyses revealed that insomnia and nightmares were 
significant predictors of PTSD symptomatology on the following day; furthermore, 
nightmares were predictive of each of the four PTSD symptom clusters, namely 
reexperiencing, avoidance, cognition and hyperarousal as well as symptoms of 
dissociation. However, PTSD symptoms did not predict insomnia or nightmares 
during the following night. Multilevel mediation analyses suggested that 
nightmares mediate the relationship between insomnia and next-day PTSD symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings support accumulating evidence that trauma-related 
sleep disturbances play an important role in the maintenance of PTSD symptoms, 
by elevating symptoms daily. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights

StonPy: a tool to parse and query collections of SBGN maps in a graph database.

Rougny A(1)(2), Balaur I(3), Luna A(4)(5), Mazein A(3).

SUMMARY: The systems biology graphical notation (SBGN) has become the de facto 
standard for the graphical representation of molecular maps. Having rapid and 
easy access to the content of large collections of maps is necessary to perform 
semantic or graph-based analysis of these resources. To this end, we propose 
StonPy, a new tool to store and query SBGN maps in a Neo4j graph database. 
StonPy notably includes a data model that takes into account all three SBGN 
languages and a completion module to automatically build valid SBGN maps from 
query results. StonPy is built as a library that can be integrated into other 
software and offers a command-line interface that allows users to easily perform 
all operations.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: StonPy is implemented in Python 3 under a GPLv3 
license. Its code and complete documentation are freely available from 
https://github.com/adrienrougny/stonpy.
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics 
online.

detection of spiramycin.

Li H(1), Wang J(2), Wang X(3), Yu H(3), Ji L(3), Zhou T(1), Liu C(4), Che G(5), 
Wang D(6).

In this test, the eggshell membrane (ESM) is selected as the support membrane 
for the biocompatibility and anchors CNTs on the surface to increase the 
mechanical properties. Then Ag NPs are decorated on CNTs-ESM substrate as SERS 
substrate by twice in-situ reduction. Finally, a layer of imprinted polymers is 
coated on the surface of the substrate to synthesize the imprinted membrane for 
selective detection of spiramycin. It is exhibited from the characteristic 
results that the CNTs significantly increase the mechanical properties and the 
detection sensitivity, simultaneously. When the concentration of SP changes 
between 10-6 ∼ 10-11 M, there is a linear relationship between SERS intensity 
and SP concentration. The detection limit is 10-11 M, and the correlation 
coefficient R2 is 0.9864. The SERS imprinted membrane can be applied into the 
detection of antibiotics in practical sample, which broadens the research field 
of antibiotics detection.

Transdiagnostic Psychopathology in a Help-Seeking Population of an Early 
Recognition Center for Mental Disorders: Protocol for an Experience Sampling 
Study.

Rosen M(#)(1), Betz LT(#)(1), Montag C(2), Kannen C(2), Kambeitz J(1).

BACKGROUND: Prevention in psychiatry provides a promising way to address the 
burden of mental illness. However, established approaches focus on specific 
diagnoses and do not address the heterogeneity and manifold potential outcomes 
of help-seeking populations that present at early recognition services. 
Conceptualizing the psychopathology manifested in help-seeking populations from 
a network perspective of interacting symptoms allows transdiagnostic 
investigations beyond binary disease categories. Furthermore, modern 
technologies such as smartphones facilitate the application of the Experience 
Sampling Method (ESM).
OBJECTIVE: This study is a combination of ESM with network analyses to provide 
valid insights beyond the established assessment instruments in a help-seeking 
population.
METHODS: We will examine 75 individuals (aged 18-40 years) of the help-seeking 
population of the Cologne early recognition center. For a maximally naturalistic 
sample, only minimal exclusion criteria will be applied. We will collect data 
for 14 days using a mobile app to assess 10 transdiagnostic symptoms (ie, 
depressive, anxious, and psychotic symptoms) as well as distress level 5 times a 
day. With these data, we will generate average group-level symptom networks and 
personalized symptom networks using a 2-step multilevel vector autoregressive 
model. Additionally, we will explore associations between symptom networks and 
sociodemographic, risk, and resilience factors, as well as psychosocial 
functioning.
RESULTS: The protocol was designed in February 2020 and approved by the Ethics 
Committee of the University Hospital Cologne in October 2020. The protocol was 
reviewed and funded by the Köln Fortune program in September 2020. Data 
collection began in November 2020 and was completed in November 2021. Of the 258 
participants who were screened, 93 (36%) fulfilled the inclusion criteria and 
were willing to participate in the study. Of these 93 participants, 86 (92%) 
completed the study. The first results are expected to be published in 2022.
CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide insights about the feasibility and utility 
of the ESM in a help-seeking population of an early recognition center. 
Providing the first explorative phenotyping of transdiagnostic psychopathology 
in this population, our study will contribute to the innovation of early 
recognition in psychiatry. The results will help pave the way for prevention and 
targeted early intervention in a broader patient group, and thus, enable greater 
intended effects in alleviating the burden of psychiatric disorders.

Production and application of purified mutanase from novel Cellulosimicrobium 
funkei SNG1 in the in vitro biofilm degradation.

Boddapati S(1), Gummadi SN(1).

Mutanase (α-1,3-glucanase) is an inducible extracellular enzyme with potential 
medical applications in dentistry. A novel Cellulosimicrobium funkei strain SNG1 
producing mutanase enzyme using α-1,3-glucans was isolated, and the enzyme was 
optimized for increased productivity using the one-factor-at-a-time approach. 
Maximum growth and enzyme-specific activity (2.12 ± 0.4 U/mg) were attained in a 
production medium with pH 7.0 and 1% α-1,3-glucans as carbon source, incubated 
at 37°C for 30 h. The result showed a five-fold increase in activity compared to 
unoptimized conditions (0.40 U/mg). The enzyme was purified by gel-filtration 
chromatography, and recovered with a yield of 29.03% and a specific activity 
increase of 10.9-fold. The molecular mass of the monomeric enzyme is 137 kDa. 
The pH and temperature optima are 6.0 and 45°C with Km of 1.28 ± 0.11 mg for 
α-1,3-glucans. The enzyme activity was stimulated by adding Co2+ , Ca2+ , Cu2+ , 
and was entirely inhibited by Hg2+ . On 2-h incubation, the purified enzyme 
effectively degraded in vitro film with an 82.68% degradation rate and a 
saccharification yield of 30%.

Protein Function Prediction with Functional and Topological Knowledge of Gene 
Ontology.

Zhao Y, Yang Z, Hong Y, Yang Y, Wang L, Zhang Y, Lin H, Wang J.

Gene Ontology (GO) is a widely used bioinformatics resource for describing 
biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components of proteins. 
It covers more than 5000 terms hierarchically organized into a directed acyclic 
graph and known functional annotations. Automatically annotating protein 
functions by using GO-based computational models has been an area of active 
research for a long time. However, due to the limited functional annotation 
information and complex topological structures of GO, existing models cannot 
effectively capture the knowledge representation of GO. To solve this issue, we 
present a method that fuses the functional and topological knowledge of GO to 
guide protein function prediction. This method employs a multi-view GCN model to 
extract a variety of GO representations from functional information, topological 
structure, and their combinations. To dynamically learn the significance weights 
of these representations, it adopts an attention mechanism to learn the final 
knowledge representation of GO. Furthermore, it uses a pre-trained language 
model (i.e., ESM-1b) to efficiently learn biological features for each protein 
sequence. Finally, it obtains all predicted scores by calculating the dot 
product of sequence features and GO representation. Our method outperforms other 
state-of-the-art methods, as demonstrated by the experimental results on 
datasets from three different species, namely Yeast, Human and Arabidopsis. Our 
proposed method's code can be accessed at:

Endophytic Fusarium species, a unique bioresource for disaggregator of misfolded 
alpha-synuclein.

Vats S(1), Saxena S(2).

Aggregation of α-synuclein into toxic oligomeric structures has been implicated 
in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease via several key stages of 
fibrillation, oligomerization, and aggregation. Disaggregation or prevention of 
aggregation has garnered a lot of attention as a therapeutic strategy to prevent 
or delay the progression of Parkinson's disease. It has been recently 
established that certain polyphenolic compounds and catechins present in plants 
and tea extracts exhibit the potential to inhibit the α-synuclein aggregation. 
However, their copious supply for therapeutic development is still unsolved. 
Herein, we report for the first time the disaggregation potential of α-synuclein 
by an endophytic fungus residing in tea leaves (Camellia sinensis). Briefly, a 
recombinant yeast expressing α-synuclein was used for pre-screening of 53 
endophytic fungi isolated from tea using anti-oxidant activity as a marker for 
the disaggregation of the protein. One isolate #59CSLEAS exhibited 92.4% 
reduction in production of the superoxide ions, which were similar to the 
already established α-synuclein disaggregator, Piceatannol exhibiting 92.8% 
reduction. Thioflavin T assay further established that #59CSLEAS decreased the 
oligomerization of α-synuclein by 1.63-fold. Subsequently 
Dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein diacetate-based fluorescence assay exhibited a 
reduction in total oxidative stress in the recombinant yeast in the presence of 
fungal extract, thereby indicating the prevention of oligomerization. Oligomer 
disaggregation potential of the selected fungal extract was found to be 56.5% as 
assessed by sandwich ELISA assay. Using morphological as well as molecular 
methods, the endophytic isolate #59CSLEAS was identified as Fusarium sp. The 
sequence was submitted in the Genbank with accession number ON226971.1.

Upregulation of RIPK1 implicates in HEK 293T cell death upon transient 
transfection of A53T-α-synuclein.

Meshkini F(1), Moradi A(1), Hosseinkhani S(2).

BACKGROUND: Alpha-synuclein (α-SN) is the central protein in synucleinopathies 
including Parkinson's disease. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms through 
which α-SN leads to neuronal death remain unclear.
METHODS: To elucidate the relationship between α-SN and apoptosis, some 
indicators of the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic cell death were assessed in 
normal and a stable HEK293T cell line expressing firefly luciferase after 
transfection with the wild-type (WT) and A53T mutant α-SN.
RESULTS: Opposite to WT-α-SN, overexpression of A53T-α-SN resulted in enhanced 
expression of almost two fold for RIPK1 (93.0 %), FADD (45 %), Caspase-8, and 
Casp-9 activity (52.0 %) in measured time. Transfection of both WT-α-SN and 
A53T-α-SN showed an increase in the Casp-3/Procasp-3 ratio (WT: 60.5 %; A53T: 
41.0 %), Casp-3 activity (WT: 65.0 %; A53T: 20.5 %), and a decrease in 
luciferase activity (WT: 50 %; A53T: 34.8 %). Overexpression of A53T-α-SN 
brought about with more cell death percentage compared to WT-α-SN within 36 h. 
No significant alteration in cytochrome c and reactive oxygen species release 
into cytosol were observed for both WT-α-SN and A53T-α-SN.
CONCLUSION: Altogether, these findings highlight the link between disease 
related mutants of α-SN (like A53T-α-SN) in triggering of RIPK1-dependent 
extrinsic apoptotic pathway in cell death during neurodegeneration.

Relationship Between Serum Endocan Levels and Other Predictors of Endothelial 
Dysfunction in Obese Women.

Mercantepe F(1), Baydur Sahin S(2), Cumhur Cure M(3), Karadag Z(4).

Endocan, or endothelial cell-specific molecule-1 (ESM-1), is a potential 
inflammatory marker implicated in endothelial dysfunction. The purpose of this 
study was to determine the correlation between serum endocan levels and the 
presence and severity of endothelial dysfunction, and the relationships with 
serum intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), adiponectin (a marker of 
inflammation), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels, and carotid 
intima-media thickness (cIMT) in obese subjects. Serum endocan, ICAM-1, 
adiponectin, hsCRP levels, and cIMT were evaluated in 76 obese women (BMI > 
30 kg/m2) and 53 controls (BMI < 25 kg/m2). ICAM-1 (P = .01), hs-CRP (p < 
0.001), and cIMT (p < .001) were significantly higher, while adiponectin (P = 
.006) was significantly lower, in obese women compared with the controls. Serum 
endocan levels were similar between the obese (470.5 ± 171.3 pg/mL) and controls 
(471.9 ± 146.3 pg/mL) (P = .732). There was no correlation between serum endocan 
values and the endothelial dysfunction markers, hsCRP (r = -.021), ICAM-1 (r = 
-.054), adiponectin (r = .113), or cIMT (r = -.060) in obesity. Endocan is not a 
suitable marker of endothelial dysfunction in the context of obesity. More 
research is required to evaluate the role of endocan in the regulation of 
inflammatory processes in obesity.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus induced autophagic response within pulmonary tissue in 
the rat model.

Bayazidi MG(1), Rahbarghazi R(2)(3), Rezabakhsh A(4), Rezaie J(5), Hassanpour 
M(2), Ahmadi M(2)(1).

Introduction: The current experiment aimed to address the impact of type 2 
diabetes mellitus on autophagy status in the rat pulmonary tissue. Methods: In 
this study, 20 male Wistar rats were randomly allocated into two groups as 
follows: control and diabetic groups. To induce type 2 diabetes mellitus, rats 
received a combination of streptozotocin (STZ) and a high-fat diet. After 
confirmation of diabetic condition, rats were maintained for 8 weeks and 
euthanized for further analyses. The pathological changes were assessed using 
H&E staining. We also measured transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), 
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in the 
lungs using ELISA and real-time PCR analyses, respectively. Malondialdehyde 
(MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels were monitored in diabetic lungs to 
assess oxidative status. We also measured the expression of becline-1, LC3, and 
P62 to show autophagic response under diabetic conditions. Using 
immunofluorescence staining, protein levels of LC3 was also monitored. Results: 
H&E staining showed pathological changes in diabetic rats coincided with the 
increase of TNF-α (~1.4-fold) and TGF-β (~1.3-fold) compared to those in the 
normal rats (P<0.05). The levels of MDA (5.6 ± 0.4 versus 6.4 ± 0.27 nM/mg 
protein) were increased while SOD (4.2 ± 0.28 versus 3.8 ± 0.13 U/mL) activity 
decreased in the diabetic rats (P<0.05). Real-time polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR) analysis showed the up-regulation of Becline-1 (~1.35-fold) and LC3 
(~2-fold) and down-regulation of P62 (~0.8-fold) (P<0.05), showing incomplete 
autophagic flux. We noted the increase of LC3+ cells in diabetic condition 
compared to that in the control samples. Conclusion: The prolonged diabetic 
condition could inhibit the normal activity of autophagy flux, thereby 
increasing pathological outcomes.

[Lysosomal enzyme analysis of mucolipidosis type II α/β and type III α/β in two 
Chinese pedigrees].

[Article in Chinese]

He T(1), Chen J, Liu S, Wang H, Zhang X.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the characteristics of lysosomal enzymes in mucolipidosis 
(ML) type II α/β and type III α/β for the choice of enzyme evaluating 
indicators.
METHODS: Multiple lysosomal enzymes including α-iduronidase (IDUA), α 
-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAGLU), β-galactosidase-1 (GLB1), β-glucuronidase 
(GUSB), α-galactosidase A (GLA), glucocerebrosidase (GBA) and arylsulphatase A 
(ASA) in plasma and leukocyte of two Chinese pedigrees with ML type II α/β and 
type III α/β and healthy controls were determined. Previous publications on ML 
type II α/β and type III α/β during the last five years were retrieved from 
PubMed, CNKI and WanFang databases by using "mucolipidosis" as key word.
RESULTS: The activities of several lysosomal enzymes were increased in the 
plasma of both patients: ASA, IDUA (20-fold) > GUSB (10-fold) > GLB1, GLA 
(5-fold) > NAGLU (2-fold), whilst there was no significant change in GBA. The 
activities of several lysosomal enzymes in the leukocyte of the two patients 
were normal. 15 lysosomal enzymes have been used in 22 previous studies, the 
most frequently used were hexosaminidase A and B (Hex A+B) (12 papers), 
α-mannosidase (α-man) (11 papers) and GUSB (10 papers). The degree of Hex A+B 
and α-man elevation was most obvious (24.4-fold and 24.7-fold on average 
respectively), followed by ASA (22.4-fold on average), GUSB is 18.8-fold on 
average.
CONCLUSION: Based on the lysosomal enzyme analysis of the two cases and 
literature review, ASA, GUSB, Hex A+B and α-man are recommended as the 
evaluating indicators for lysosomal enzyme analysis of ML type II α/β and type 
III α/β.

AIONER: All-in-one scheme-based biomedical named entity recognition using deep 
learning.

Luo L(1)(2), Wei CH(1), Lai PT(1), Leaman R(1), Chen Q(1), Lu Z(1).

MOTIVATION: Biomedical named entity recognition (BioNER) seeks to automatically 
recognize biomedical entities in natural language text, serving as a necessary 
foundation for downstream text mining tasks and applications such as information 
extraction and question answering. Manually labeling training data for the 
BioNER task is costly, however, due to the significant domain expertise required 
for accurate annotation. The resulting data scarcity causes current BioNER 
approaches to be prone to overfitting, to suffer from limited generalizability, 
and to address a single entity type at a time (e.g., gene or disease).
RESULTS: We therefore propose a novel all-in-one (AIO) scheme that uses external 
data from existing annotated resources to enhance the accuracy and stability of 
BioNER models. We further present AIONER, a general-purpose BioNER tool based on 
cutting-edge deep learning and our AIO schema. We evaluate AIONER on 14 BioNER 
benchmark tasks and show that AIONER is effective, robust, and compares 
favorably to other state-of-the-art approaches such as multi-task learning. We 
further demonstrate the practical utility of AIONER in three independent tasks 
to recognize entity types not previously seen in training data, as well as the 
advantages of AIONER over existing methods for processing biomedical text at a 
large scale (e.g., the entire PubMed data).
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code, trained models and data for 
AIONER are freely available at https://github.com/ncbi/AIONER.
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics 
online.

Progress of the COVID-19: Persistence, Effectiveness, and Immune Escape of the 
Neutralizing Antibody in Convalescent Serum.

X(10), Xia J(4), Ke C(2)(3)(5)(6)(7).

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a new coronavirus 
causing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), is a major topic of global human 
health concern. The Delta and Omicron variants have caused alarming responses 
worldwide due to their high transmission rates and a number of mutations. During 
a one-year follow-up (from June 2020 to June 2021), we included 114 patients 
with SARS-CoV-2 infection to study the long-term dynamics and the correlative 
factors of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in convalescent patients. The blood 
samples were collected at two detection time points (at 6 and 12 months after 
discharge). We evaluated the NAbs response of discharged patients by performing 
a micro-neutralization assay using a SARS-CoV-2 wild type. In addition, a total 
of 62 serum samples from discharged COVID-19 patients with Alpha, Beta, Delta, 
and Omicron variants of infection were enrolled to perform cross-neutralization 
tests using the original SARS-CoV-2 strain and VOCs variants (including Alpha, 
Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron variants) and to assess the ability of NAbs 
against the SARS-CoV-2 variants. NAbs seroconversion occurred in 91.46% of 
patients (n = 82) in the first timepoint and in 89.29% of patients (n = 84) in 
the second detection point, and three kinds of NAbs kinetics curves were 
perceived. The NAbs levels in young patients had higher values than those in 
elder patients. The kinetics of disease duration was accompanied by an opposite 
trend in NAbs levels. Despite a declining NAbs response, NAbs activity was still 
detectable in a substantial proportion of recovered patients one year after 
discharge. Compared to the wild strain, the Omicron strain could lead to a 
23.44-, 3.42-, 8.03-, and 2.57-fold reduction in neutralization capacity in 
"SAlpha", "SBeta", "SDelta", and "SOmicron", respectively, and the NAbs levels 
against the Omicron strain were significantly lower than those of the Beta and 
Delta variants. Remarkably, the NAbs activity of convalescent serum with Omicron 
strain infection was most obviously detectable against six SARS-CoV-2 strains in 
our study. The role of the vaccination history in NAbs levels further confirmed 
the previous study that reported vaccine-induced NAbs as the convincing 
protection mechanism against SARS-CoV-2. In conclusion, our findings highlighted 
the dynamics of the long-term immune responses after the disappearance of 
symptoms and revealed that NAbs levels varied among all types of convalescent 
patients with COVID-19 and that NAbs remained detectable for one year, which is 
reassuring in terms of protection against reinfection. Moreover, a moderate 
correlation between the duration of disease and Nabs titers was observed, 
whereas age was negatively correlated with Nabs titers. On the other hand, 
compared with other VOCs, the Omicron variant was able to escape the defenses of 
the immune system more significantly, and the convalescent serum infected with 
the Omicron variant played a critical part in protection against different 
SARS-CoV-2 variants. Recovery serum from individuals vaccinated with inactivated 
vaccine preceding infection with the Omicron strain had a high efficacy against 
the original strain and the VOCs variants, whereas the convalescent serum of 
persons vaccinated by inactivated vaccine prior to infection with the Delta 
variant was only potent against the wild-type strain.

Solvent extraction of recombinant interferon alpha-2b from inclusion bodies and 
efficient refolding at high protein concentrations.

Mousavi SB(1), Davarpanah SJ(2).

Interferon alpha-2b (IFNα-2b) is an essential cytokine widely used in hepatitis 
and cancer treatment. This paper presents a novel protocol for purification and 
efficient refolding of recombinant interferon alpha-2b (IFNα-2b) expressed as 
insoluble inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli. Purification of IFNα-2b from 
solubilized inclusion bodies was performed by solvent extraction using 
2-butanol. Refolding conditions were optimized using the response surface method 
(RSM). Under optimized conditions, refolding yield of solvent-extracted IFNα-2b 
was 1.5 fold higher than refolding yield of unpurified IFNα-2b. 
High-concentration protein refolding was carried out by pulse-fed method, and 
refolding yield of 75% was achieved at a protein concentration of 300 μg ml-1. 
Under optimized conditions, 259.16 mg of purified IFNα-2b with the biological 
activity of 2.4 × 108 IU mg-1 was achieved per liter of bacterial culture. The 
developed protocol provides an efficient production process of high-quality 
IFNα-2b suitable for research and pharmaceutical applications.

Lipids in Mitochondrial Macroautophagy: Phase Behavior of Bilayers Containing 
Cardiolipin and Ceramide.

Varela YR(1), González-Ramírez EJ(1), Iriondo MN(1), Ballesteros U(1), Etxaniz 
A(1), Montes LR(1), Goñi FM(1), Alonso A(1).

Cardiolipin (CL) is a key lipid for damaged mitochondrial recognition by the 
LC3/GABARAP human autophagy proteins. The role of ceramide (Cer) in this process 
is unclear, but CL and Cer have been proposed to coexist in mitochondria under 
certain conditions. Varela et al. showed that in model membranes composed of egg 
sphingomyelin (eSM), dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), and CL, the 
addition of Cer enhanced the binding of LC3/GABARAP proteins to bilayers. Cer 
gave rise to lateral phase separation of Cer-rich rigid domains but protein 
binding took place mainly in the fluid continuous phase. In the present study, a 
biophysical analysis of bilayers composed of eSM, DOPE, CL, and/or Cer was 
attempted to understand the relevance of this lipid coexistence. Bilayers were 
studied by differential scanning calorimetry, confocal fluorescence microscopy, 
and atomic force microscopy. Upon the addition of CL and Cer, one continuous 
phase and two segregated ones were formed. In bilayers with egg 
phosphatidylcholine instead of eSM, in which the binding of LC3/GABARAP proteins 
hardly increased with Cer in the former study, a single segregated phase was 
formed. Assuming that phase separation at the nanoscale is ruled by the same 
principles acting at the micrometer scale, it is proposed that Cer-enriched 
rigid nanodomains, stabilized by eSM:Cer interactions formed within the DOPE- 
and CL-enriched fluid phase, result in structural defects at the rigid/fluid 
nanointerfaces, thus hypothetically facilitatingLC3/GABARAP protein interaction.

A Group Intervention for Motivational Deficits: Preliminary Investigation of a 
Blended Care Approach Using Ambulatory Assessment.

Thonon B(1), Levaux MN(2), van Aubel E(3), Larøi F(1).

Motivational deficits are an important predictor of functional outcomes in 
individuals with a serious mental illness such as schizophrenia and mood 
spectrum disorders. The aim of the present study was to explore the feasibility, 
acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a group version of "Switch," an 
intervention that targets motivational deficits, enriched with an ecological 
momentary intervention (EMI) approach (i.e., prompts on the participants' 
smartphone to encourage the use of trained strategies in their daily life). 
Eight participants with schizophrenia, schizoaffective, or major depressive 
disorder entered the study. The intervention took place twice a week for 
2 months. Assessment measures included traditional evaluations of motivational 
negative symptoms, apathy, quality of life and daily functioning, in addition to 
ambulatory assessment methods strategies, including the experience sampling 
method (ESM) to assess motivation and related processes, and actigraphy (daily 
step-count) to assess participants' activity level. Four participants were 
considered as non-completers (followed less than 2/3 of the program) and four 
were considered as completers. Only completers presented a decrease in 
amotivation/apathy and an improvement in functional outcomes after the 
intervention and at follow-up. Furthermore, mixed-effects ESM models showed 
significant interaction effects on multiple processes related to motivation, 
indicating improvements only in completers: heightened motivation, increased 
engagement in meaningful and effortful activities, better mood, higher levels of 
confidence, increased frequency of projection into the future (pleasure 
anticipation), and of positive reminiscence. This preliminary investigation 
provides evidence that Switch may be an effective intervention, with specific 
effects on motivation and associated processes.

Diversity beyond density: Experienced social mixing of urban streets.

Fan Z(1)(2), Su T(3)(4), Sun M(1)(5), Noyman A(6), Zhang F(7), Pentland A'(6), 
Moro E(6)(8)(9).

Urban density, in the form of residents' and visitors' concentration, is long 
considered to foster diverse exchanges of interpersonal knowledge and skills, 
which are intrinsic to sustainable human settlements. However, with current 
urban studies primarily devoted to city- and district-level analyses, we cannot 
unveil the elemental connection between urban density and diversity. Here we use 
an anonymized and privacy-enhanced mobile dataset of 0.5 million opted-in users 
from three metropolitan areas in the United States to show that at the scale of 
urban streets, density is not the only path to diversity. We represent the 
diversity of each street with the experienced social mixing (ESM), which 
describes the chances of people meeting diverse income groups throughout their 
daily experience. We conduct multiple experiments and show that the 
concentration of visitors only explains 26% of street-level ESM. However, 
adjacent amenities, residential diversity, and income level account for 44% of 
the ESM. Moreover, using longitudinal business data, we show that streets with 
an increased number of food businesses have seen an increased ESM from 2016 to 
2018. Lastly, although streets with more visitors are more likely to have crime, 
diverse streets tend to have fewer crimes. These findings suggest that cities 
can leverage many tools beyond density to curate a diverse and safe street 
experience for people.

ADD1 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms Are Associated With Essential Hypertension 
Among Han and Mongolian Population in Inner Mongolia Area.

Zhang Y(1), Chang P(2)(3), Liu Z(2).

Aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) and α-adducing (ADD1) are candidate genes that 
play key roles during essential hypertension (EH) incidence. However, the 
association between their genetic mutations and the risk of EH is unclear. The 
present study investigated specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 
CYP11B2 and ADD1, and their potential role as risk factors for EH based on 423 
Mongolian and 410 Han people in Inner Mongolia province. In the allelic model, 
people with ADD1 rs2239728-A presented a 0.74-fold risk than rs2239728-C, 
whereas the ADD1 rs4961-T was associated with a 1.37-fold higher risk than 
allele G in the Han population. The genetic model reported that the rs2239728-A 
carrier (AA + AC) was 0.59-fold lower than the CC carrier, whereas the rs4961-G 
carrier (GG + GT) was 0.59-fold lower than the TT carrier in the dominant model. 
After gender adjustment, people with rs2239728-A was a 0.63-fold risk than -C in 
EH, but the rs4961-T carrier was associated with a 1.63-times higher risk than 
-G in females. Haplotype analysis showed that GCCT was associated with essential 
hypertension in the Han population, and it was a risk factor for EH. Our 
identification reported novel SNPs of ADD1 with protective significance for EH 
among females in the Chinese Han population, together with its haplotype GCCT as 
a risk factor for EH.

DE(2), Bernkop-Schnürch A(3).

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of thiolated α-cyclodextrin (α-CD-SH) on 
the cellular uptake of its payload. For this purpose, α-CD was thiolated using 
phosphorous pentasulfide. Thiolated α-CD was characterized by FT-IR and 1H NMR 
spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and powder X-ray 
diffractometry (PXRD). Cytotoxicity of α-CD-SH was evaluated on Caco-2, HEK 293, 
and MC3T3 cells. Dilauryl fluorescein (DLF) and coumarin-6 (Cou) serving as 
surrogates for a pharmaceutical payload were incorporated in α-CD-SH, and 
cellular uptake was analyzed by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. 
Endosomal escape was investigated by confocal microscopy and hemolysis assay. 
Results showed no cytotoxic effect within 3 h, while dose-dependent cytotoxicity 
was observed within 24 h. The cellular uptake of DLF and Cou was up to 20- and 
11-fold enhanced by α-CD-SH compared to native α-CD, respectively. Furthermore, 
α-CD-SH provided an endosomal escape. According to these results, α-CD-SH is a 
promising carrier to shuttle drugs into the cytoplasm of target cells.

The post-translational modification (e.g., phosphorylation) of estrogen receptor 
α (ERα) plays a role in controlling the expression and subcellular localization 
of ERα as well as its sensitivity to hormone response. Here, we show that ERα is 
also modified by UFM1 and this modification (ufmylation) plays a crucial role in 
promoting the stability and transactivity of ERα, which in turn promotes breast 
cancer development. The elevation of ufmylation via the knockdown of UFSP2 (the 
UFM1-deconjugating enzyme in humans) dramatically increases ERα stability by 
inhibiting ubiquitination. In contrast, ERα stability is decreased by the 
prevention of ufmylation via the silencing of UBA5 (the UFM1-activating E1 
enzyme). Lys171 and Lys180 of ERα were identified as the major UFM1 acceptor 
sites, and the replacement of both Lys residues by Arg (2KR mutation) markedly 
reduced ERα stability. Moreover, the 2KR mutation abrogated the 
17β-estradiol-induced transactivity of ERα and the expression of its downstream 
target genes, including pS2, cyclin D1, and c-Myc; this indicates that ERα 
ufmylation is required for its transactivation function. In addition, the 2KR 
mutation prevented anchorage-independent colony formation by MCF7 cells. Most 
notably, the expression of UFM1 and its conjugating machinery (i.e., UBA5, UFC1, 
UFL1, and UFBP1) were dramatically upregulated in ERα-positive breast cancer 
cell lines and tissues. Collectively, these findings implicate a critical role 
attributed to ERα ufmylation in breast cancer development by ameliorating its 
stability and transactivity.

Evaluation of endothelial cell-specific molecule-1 as a biomarker of glycocalyx 
damage in canine myxomatous mitral valve disease.

Hong HJ(1), Oh YI(1), Park SM(1), An JH(1), Kim TH(1), Chae HK(1), Seo KW(1), 
Youn HY(2).

BACKGROUND: Endothelial cell-specific molecule-1 (ESM-1) has emerged as a 
potential biomarker for cardiovascular disease in humans. Myxomatous mitral 
valve disease (MMVD) is the most common heart disease in dogs, and we 
hypothesized that MMVD causes chronic inflammation that increases susceptibility 
to endothelial glycocalyx (eGCX) damage. In this study, we measured the 
concentration of ESM-1 in a group of dogs with MMVD and evaluated factors 
affecting eGCX damage.
RESULTS: Sixty-four dogs (control, n = 6; MMVD, n = 58) were enrolled in this 
study. There was no significant difference in serum ESM-1 concentrations among 
the MMVD stages. The serum ESM-1 concentration was significantly higher in the 
death group than in the alive group in MMVD dogs. (p = 0.006). In five dogs with 
MMVD, serum ESM-1 concentrations tended to decrease when the cardiac drug 
(pimobendan, furosemide, and digoxin) dose was increased.
CONCLUSIONS: In cases where MMVD progressed to decompensated heart failure with 
clinical symptoms and resulted in death, the concentration of serum ESM-1 
increased significantly. Therefore, ESM-1 could be utilized as a new potential 
negative prognostic factor in patients with MMVD.

The association of personality traits with poststroke fatigue in daily life: An 
exploratory experience sampling method and cross-sectional study.

Lazeron-Savu E(1)(2), Lenaert B(1)(3)(4)(5), Ponds R(1)(3)(6), van Heugten 
C(1)(3)(4).

Fatigue is a frequently occurring and persistent symptom after stroke. Many 
biological, psychosocial, and behavioural factors are associated with poststroke 
fatigue, but research into associations with personality traits is relatively 
sparse. In this study, we explored whether personality traits were related to 
poststroke fatigue measured with conventional fatigue questionnaires as well as 
experience sampling methodology (ESM). Twenty-four individuals with stroke 
completed 10 daily questionnaires about momentary (here-and-now) fatigue for six 
consecutive days using the mHealth ESM application PsyMateTM. Further, they 
completed questionnaires assessing personality (NEO-FFI and LOR-T) and fatigue 
(FSS). Results showed that higher extraversion (ß = -.44, SE = .12, p = .001; 
95% CI = -.67-.19) and optimism (ß = -.18, SE = .06, p = .007; 95% 
CI = -.30-.05) were associated with lower momentary fatigue. No association was 
found between neuroticism and momentary fatigue, but higher neuroticism 
(r = 0.531, p = .008, 95% CI = .160-.759; r = .574, p = .003, 95% 
CI = .245-.767) was associated with higher scores on the retrospective FSS 
scales. We conclude that personality traits differentially influence poststroke 
fatigue, but this also depends on the way fatigue is measured (with 
retrospective or with momentary measures). When functional gains are not in line 
with expected progress during the rehabilitation treatment of fatigue, it may be 
appropriate to take into account how person characteristics are related to 
momentary fatigue.

Capturing the Dynamics of the Social Environment Through Experience Sampling 
Methods, Passive Sensing, and Egocentric Networks: Scoping Review.

Langener AM(1)(2)(3), Stulp G(2), Kas MJ(1), Bringmann LF(3)(4).

BACKGROUND: Social interactions are important for well-being, and therefore, 
researchers are increasingly attempting to capture people's social environment. 
Many different disciplines have developed tools to measure the social 
environment, which can be highly variable over time. The experience sampling 
method (ESM) is often used in psychology to study the dynamics within a person 
and the social environment. In addition, passive sensing is often used to 
capture social behavior via sensors from smartphones or other wearable devices. 
Furthermore, sociologists use egocentric networks to track how social 
relationships are changing. Each of these methods is likely to tap into 
different but important parts of people's social environment. Thus far, the 
development and implementation of these methods have occurred mostly separately 
from each other.
OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to synthesize the literature on how these methods are 
currently used to capture the changing social environment in relation to 
well-being and assess how to best combine these methods to study well-being.
METHODS: We conducted a scoping review according to the PRISMA (Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines.
RESULTS: We included 275 studies. In total, 3 important points follow from our 
review. First, each method captures a different but important part of the social 
environment at a different temporal resolution. Second, measures are rarely 
validated (>70% of ESM studies and 50% of passive sensing studies were not 
validated), which undermines the robustness of the conclusions drawn. Third, a 
combination of methods is currently lacking (only 15/275, 5.5% of the studies 
combined ESM and passive sensing, and no studies combined all 3 methods) but is 
essential in understanding well-being.
CONCLUSIONS: We highlight that the practice of using poorly validated measures 
hampers progress in understanding the relationship between the changing social 
environment and well-being. We conclude that different methods should be 
combined more often to reduce the participants' burden and form a holistic 
perspective on the social environment.

How to explore within-person and between-person measurement model differences in 
intensive longitudinal data with the R package lmfa.

Vogelsmeier LVDE(1), Vermunt JK(2), De Roover K(2).

Intensive longitudinal data (ILD) have become popular for studying within-person 
dynamics in psychological constructs (or between-person differences therein). 
Before investigating the dynamics, it is crucial to examine whether the 
measurement model (MM) is the same across subjects and time and, thus, whether 
the measured constructs have the same meaning. If the MM differs (e.g., because 
of changes in item interpretation or response styles), observations cannot be 
validly compared. Exploring differences in the MM for ILD can be done with 
latent Markov factor analysis (LMFA), which classifies observations based on the 
underlying MM (for many subjects and time points simultaneously) and thus shows 
which observations are comparable. However, the complexity of the method or the 
fact that no open-source software for LMFA existed until now may have hindered 
researchers from applying the method in practice. In this article, we provide a 
step-by-step tutorial for the new user-friendly software package lmfa, which 
allows researchers to easily perform the analysis LMFA in the freely available 
software R to investigate MM differences in their own ILD.

The Social Dimension of the European Union: A Means to lock out Social 
Competition?

Bilbao-Ubillos J(1).

In the process of European integration, the social dimension has to date been 
subordinated to presumed economic requirements. There have been no specific 
commitments to preserve the European Social Model (ESM), which has been 
gradually diluted as a result of successive EU enlargements, the impact of 
ageing, job insecurity and socio-cultural changes on social protection systems 
and the pressure exerted by globalisation in a context of ever harsher market 
competition. Moreover, the decisions adopted by the EU in addressing the 2008 
economic crisis have led Community institutions gradually to impose reforms of 
pension systems and labour markets, particularly in southern countries, which 
threaten to reduce the level of protection provided for citizens. This paper 
argues that the EU aquis is not sufficient to prevent social competition and 
warns of the risks arising from the current dynamic in terms of maintaining 
social cohesion, equal opportunities and fairness as basic features of European 
identity. Some data that illustrate the varying degrees of intensity and effort 
in social welfare provisions by Member States and the gradual divergence in 
social protection benefits are provided (using dispersion measurements). In an 
effort to be proactive, a number of proposals are given with a view to reversing 
this trend and consolidating the social content of the European project.

Antiskin Aging Effects of Indole Alkaloid N-Glycoside from Ginkgo Fruit (Ginkgo 
biloba fruit) on TNF-α-Exposed Human Dermal Fibroblasts.

Choi YJ(1), Alishir A(2), Jang T(3), Kang KS(1), Lee S(4), Kim KH(2).

Human skin aging has internal and external factors, both of which are 
characterized by TNF-α overproduction. Therefore, we aimed to identify a natural 
product that suppresses the damage that occurs in cutaneous dermal fibroblasts 
exposed to TNF-α. The protective effects of the indole alkaloid N-glycoside, 
ginkgoside B dimethyl ester (GBDE), isolated from ginkgo fruit (Ginkgo biloba 
fruit) were evaluated in TNF-α stimulated human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs). GBDE 
inhibited TNF-α-induced MMP-1 expression to 2.2 ± 0.1-fold (p < 0.01) and 
reversed the decrease in collagen levels to 0.4 ± 0.00-fold (p < 0.01) at 50 μM. 
The effect of GBDE was due to the suppression of the phospolylaton of MAPKs 
(ERK, 0.47 ± 0.05; JNK, 1.21 ± 0.07; p38, 0.77 ± 0.07-folds, p < 0.001) and Akt 
(0.14 ± 0.03-fold, p < 0.001) compared to the TNF-α group. GBDE also reduced the 
expression of COX-2 to 2.06 ± 0.12-fold (p < 0.001) and increased the expression 
of HO-1 to 10.64 ± 0.2-fold (p < 0.001). In addition, GBDE inhibited the 
expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-8, 2.2 ± 0.0; IL-1β, 1.6 ± 0.0; 
IL-6, 2.0 ± 0.10-folds, p < 0.05). These results provide experimental evidence 
that GBDE can protect against skin damage, including aging.

Recently, polymer electrolytes have been developed for high-performance and 
eco-friendly fuel cells. Among the candidates, eggshell membrane (ESM) has been 
promising because of its abundance to assemble various energy devices with low 
cost and its absorption ability of organic materials. In this work, we 
investigated fuel cells that included ESM-absorbing xanthene-, 
triphenylmethane-, and azo-type tar dye, which contained abundant hydrophilic 
groups, as polymer electrolytes. We found out two points: (1) that the fuel 
cells that included ESM-absorbing xanthene-type dye generated the highest I-V 
performance, and (2) the basic molecular structures of the tar dyes determined 
the correlation of the maximum power and proton conductivities.

Every Second Matters - uterine balloon tamponade implementation across ten 
medical colleges in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh in India: A qualitative 
study.

Posever N(1)(2), Sipahi S(3)(4), Shivkumar PV(5), Burke TF(1)(3)(6).

OBJECTIVE: To understand facilitators, barriers, and perceptions of the Every 
Second Matters uterine balloon tamponade (ESM-UBT) package implemented across 10 
medical colleges in India, 3 years after the program was introduced.
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted until thematic saturation in 
March 2020. Multiple provider cadres, including nurses, Obstetrics/Gynecology 
residents, professors, and program leads, were eligible. Interviews were 
transcribed and thematically coded using an inductive method.
RESULTS: Sixty-two obstetric providers were interviewed. Facilitators of 
implementation included recurrent training, improved teamwork and communication, 
strong program leadership, and involvement of lower-level facilities. Barriers 
to implementation included administrative hurdles, high staff turnover, language 
barriers, and resources required to reach and train lower-level facilities. 
Overall, the majority of clinicians viewed the ESM-UBT package as a useful 
intervention in aiding efforts to reduce maternal deaths from postpartum 
hemorrhage.
CONCLUSIONS: Among 10 medical colleges in India the ESM-UBT package is seen as a 
beneficial intervention for managing refractory atonic postpartum hemorrhage, 
and for reducing maternal morbidity and mortality. Identified facilitators of 
and barriers to implementation of the ESM-UBT package in India should be used to 
guide future implementation efforts.

Impact of Starch Binding Domain Fusion on Activities and Starch Product 
Structure of 4-α-Glucanotransferase.

Wang Y(1), Wu Y(2), Christensen SJ(3), Janeček Š(4)(5), Bai Y(2), Møller MS(6), 
Svensson B(1).

A broad range of enzymes are used to modify starch for various applications. 
Here, a thermophilic 4-α-glucanotransferase from Thermoproteus uzoniensis 
(TuαGT) is engineered by N-terminal fusion of the starch binding domains (SBDs) 
of carbohydrate binding module family 20 (CBM20) to enhance its affinity for 
granular starch. The SBDs are N-terminal tandem domains (SBDSt1 and SBDSt2) from 
Solanum tuberosum disproportionating enzyme 2 (StDPE2) and the C-terminal domain 
(SBDGA) of glucoamylase from Aspergillus niger (AnGA). In silico analysis of 
CBM20s revealed that SBDGA and copies one and two of GH77 DPE2s belong to well 
separated clusters in the evolutionary tree; the second copies being more 
closely related to non-CAZyme CBM20s. The activity of SBD-TuαGT fusions 
increased 1.2-2.4-fold on amylose and decreased 3-9 fold on maltotriose compared 
with TuαGT. The fusions showed similar disproportionation activity on 
gelatinised normal maize starch (NMS). Notably, hydrolytic activity was 
1.3-1.7-fold elevated for the fusions leading to a reduced molecule weight and 
higher α-1,6/α-1,4-linkage ratio of the modified starch. Notably, SBDGA-TuαGT 
and-SBDSt2-TuαGT showed Kd of 0.7 and 1.5 mg/mL for waxy maize starch (WMS) 
granules, whereas TuαGT and SBDSt1-TuαGT had 3-5-fold lower affinity. SBDSt2 
contributed more than SBDSt1 to activity, substrate binding, and the stability 
of TuαGT fusions.

Cosmeceutical formulations of pro-vitamin E phosphate: In-vitro release testing 
and dermal penetration into excised human skin.

Long-term exposure to solar radiation can lead to skin damage such as 
photoageing, and photocarcinogenesis. This can be prevented by topically 
applying α-tocopherol phosphate (α-TP). The major challenge is that a 
significant amount of α-TP needs to reach viable skin layers for effective 
photoprotection. This study aims to develop candidate formulations of α-TP 
(gel-like, solution, lotion, and gel), and investigate formulation 
characteristics' effect on membrane diffusion and human skin permeation. All the 
formulations developed in the study had an appealing appearance and no signs of 
separation. All formulations had low viscosity and high spreadability except the 
gel. The flux of α-TP through the polyethersulfone membrane was the highest for 
lotion (6.63 ± 0.86 mg/cm2/h), followed by control gel-like 
(6.14 ± 1.76 mg/cm2/h), solution (4.65 ± 0.86 mg/cm2/h), and gel 
(1.02 ± 0.22 mg/cm2/h). The flux of α-TP through the human skin membrane was 
numerically higher for lotion compared to the gel-like (328.6 
vs.175.2 µg/cm2/h). The lotion delivered 3-fold and 5-fold higher α-TP in viable 
skin layers at 3 h and 24 h, respectively, compared to that of the gel-like. The 
low skin membrane penetration rate and deposition of α-TP in viable skin layers 
were observed for the solution and gel. Our study demonstrated that dermal 
penetration of α-TP was influenced by characteristics of formulation such as 
formulation type, pH, and viscosity. The α-TP in the lotion scavenged higher 
DPPH free radicals compared to that of gel-like (almost 73% vs. 46%). The IC50 
of α-TP in lotion was significantly lower than that of gel-like (397.2 vs. 
626.0 µg/mL). The preservative challenge test specifications were fulfilled by 
Geogard 221 and suggested that the combination of benzyl alcohol and 
Dehydroacetic Acid effectively preserved 2% α-TP lotion. This result confirms 
the suitability of the α-TP cosmeceutical lotion formulation employed in the 
present work for effective photoprotection.

Linker-peptide-mediated one-step purification and immobilization of 
α-L-rhamnosidase from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron for direct biotransformation 
from epimedin C to icariin.

Lu C(1), Zou K(1), Guo B(1), Li Q(1), Wang Z(2), Xiao W(3), Zhao L(4).

Icariin, the most effective bioactive component in Epimedium, is also the index 
component of Epimedium quality control in Pharmacopoeia. It was a very 
attractive approach for bioconversion from epimedin C to icariin. However, its 
potential was impeded by poor stability and non-recyclable properties of free 
enzymes. In this study, we have fused the linker (4LP) to α-L-rhamnosidase BtRha 
and successfully prepared the immobilized enzyme (incubated 4LP-BtRha@Na-Y) to 
produce icariin from epimedin C. The activity recovery of 4LP-BtRha@Na-Y was 
79.6 %, and enzyme activity was 209.8 U/g, which was 1.75-fold and 1.6-fold 
higher than that of immobilized BtRha (BtRha@Na-Y), respectively. The optimal 
reaction temperature and pH of 4LP-BtRha@Na-Y was 55 °C and 6.5, respectively. 
The thermal stability of immobilized enzyme was significantly improved by 
incubation in phosphate buffer containing 20 % glycerol and 10 % fructose. The 
kcat/Km value of incubated 4LP-BtRha@Na-Y was 7.98 × 105 s-1M-1, which increased 
by 8 % compared with free BtRha. Finally, under suitable conditions, 1 g/L 
epimedin C was transformed into icariin with icariin yield 75.1 %, and the 
relative conversion rate retained 74.9 % after reused 13 cycles. This experiment 
provides a new idea for one-step purification and immobilization of 
α-L-rhamnosidase for direct biotransformation from epimedin C to icariin, which 
will have great prospects in food and pharmaceutical production.

Semi-rational engineering membrane binding domain of L-amino acid deaminase from 
Proteus vulgaris for enhanced α-ketoisocaproate.

Song Y(1), Wang R(1), Zhang Z(1), Liu X(1), Qi L(1), Shentu X(1), Yu X(1).

α-Keto acids are important raw materials for pharmaceuticals and functional 
foods, which could be produced from cheap feed stock by whole cell biocatalysts 
containing L-amino acid deaminases (L-AADs). However, the production capacity is 
limited by the low activity of L-AADs. The L-AAD mediated redox reaction employs 
the electron transport chain to transfer electrons from the reduced FADH2 to O2, 
implying that the interaction between L-AAD and the cell membrane affects its 
catalytic activity. To improve the catalytic activity of L-AAD from Proteus 
vulgaris, we redesigned the membrane-bound hydrophobic insertion sequences (INS, 
residues 325-375) by saturation mutagenesis and high-throughput screening. 
Mutants D340N and L363N exhibited higher affinity and catalytic efficiency for 
L-leucine, with half-life 1.62-fold and 1.28-fold longer than that of wild-type 
L-AAD. D340N catalyzed L-leucine to produce 81.21 g⋅L-1 α-ketoisocaproate, with 
a bioconversion rate of 89.06%, which was 17.57% higher than that of the 
wild-type. It is predicted that the mutations enhanced the interaction between 
the protein and the cell membrane.

Intrinsically Disordered Kiwellin Protein-Like Effectors Target Plant 
Chloroplasts and are Extensively Present in Rust Fungi.

Jaswal R(1), Rajarammohan S(1), Dubey H(2), Kiran K(2), Rawal H(2), Sonah H(1), 
Deshmukh R(1), Sharma TR(3)(4).

The effector proteins produced by plant pathogens are one of the essential 
components of host-pathogen interaction. Despite being important, most of the 
effector proteins remain unexplored due to the diversity in their primary 
sequence generated by the high selection pressure of the host immune system. 
However to maintain the primary function in the infection process, these 
effectors may tend to maintain their native protein fold to perform the 
corresponding biological function. In the present study, unannotated candidate 
secretory effector proteins of sixteen major plant fungal pathogens were 
analyzed to find the conserved known protein folds using homology, ab initio, 
and Alpha Fold/Rosetta Fold protein dimensional (3D) structure approaches. 
Several unannotated candidate effector proteins were found to match various 
known conserved protein families potentially involved in host defense 
manipulation in different plant pathogens. Surprisingly a large number of plant 
Kiwellin proteins fold like secretory proteins (> 100) were found in studied 
rust fungal pathogens. Many of them were predicted as potential effector 
proteins. Furthermore, template independent modelling using Alpha Fold/Rosetta 
Fold analysis and structural comparison of these candidates also predicted them 
to match with plant Kiwellin proteins. We also found plant Kiwellin matching 
proteins outside rusts including several non-pathogenic fungi suggesting the 
broad function of these proteins. One of the highest confidently modeled 
Kiwellin matching candidates effectors, Pstr_13960 (97.8%), from the Indian P. 
striiformis race Yr9 was characterized using overexpression, localization, and 
deletion studies in Nicotiana benthamiana. The Pstr_13960 suppressed the 
BAX-induced cell death and localized in the chloroplast. Furthermore, the 
expression of the Kiwellin matching region (Pst_13960_kiwi) alone suppressed the 
BAX-induced cell death in N. benthamiana despite the change of location to the 
cytoplasm and nucleus, suggesting the novel function of the Kiwellin core fold 
in rust fungi. Molecular docking showed that Pstr_13960 can interact with plant 
Chorismate mutases (CMs) using three loops conserved in plant and rust 
Kiwellins. Further analysis of Pstr_13960 showed to contain Intrinsically 
disordered regions (IDRs) in place of the N-terminal β1/β2 region found in plant 
Kiwellins suggesting the evolution of rust Kiwellins-like effectors (KLEs). 
Overall, this study reports the presence of a Kiwellin protein-like fold 
containing a novel effector protein family in rust fungi depicting a classical 
example of the evolution of effectors at the structure level as Kiwellin 
effectors show very low significant similarity to plant Kiwellin at the sequence 
level.

Integrating personalized experience sampling in psychotherapy: A case 
illustration of the Therap-i module.

von Klipstein L(1), Servaas MN(1), Schoevers RA(1), van der Veen DC(1), Riese 
H(1).

BACKGROUND: The experience sampling methodology (ESM) is increasingly being 
suggested as a clinical tool in mental health care, as it offers ecologically 
valid, microlevel information on psychopathological processes. Patients and 
clinicians have recommended that applications of ESM should be personalized and 
integrated into the existing clinical process, but there is still much 
uncertainty about how implementation may look like.
OBJECTIVE: To provide an example of personalized ESM assessment and feedback 
being integrated into psychotherapy for depression, specifically looking at the 
collaborative use of ESM in case conceptualization.
METHODS: George, a 27-year-old man diagnosed with depression, and his therapist 
participated in the Therap-i randomized controlled trial, which investigates the 
efficacy of a personalized ESM module added to psychotherapy. Together, they 
created a personalized ESM questionnaire, aiming to capture their hypotheses and 
questions regarding George's case conceptualization. George then filled out his 
ESM questionnaire five times per day, for 8 weeks. During this period, ESM data 
were discussed and interpreted by George, his therapist, and a researcher, in 
three feedback sessions. In these sessions, data were visualized in a flexible 
feedback interface that allowed for collaborative exploration of George's data. 
Both patient and therapist evaluated the module through questionnaires and 
George also participated in a semi-structured evaluation interview.
RESULTS: George's ESM questionnaire included personalized items on the topics of 
self-esteem and open versus withdrawn behavior. He completed 241 (89.3%) 
assessments. Discussions during the feedback sessions focused on two core 
themes: First, George's low energy level, which was further explored with regard 
to his sleep, medication, and activity patterns. Second, his low sense of 
self-esteem, which led to an in-depth exploration of his thinking patterns and 
social interactions. The ESM module was seen as useful and insightful by both 
George and therapist.
CONCLUSIONS: This case shows how ESM and ESM-based feedback can stimulate the 
collaborative exploration of the patient's complaints, and how it can provide 
useful insights for treatment. We discuss how our personalized ESM module 
relates to current clinical principles and practices, and make suggestions for 
further implementation.

Experiencing hallucinations in daily life: The role of metacognition.

Wright AC(1), Palmer-Cooper E(2), Cella M(3), McGuire N(4), Montagnese M(5), 
Dlugunovych V(6), Liu CJ(7), Wykes T(3), Cather C(8).

BACKGROUND: Hallucinations have been linked to failures in metacognitive 
reflection suggesting an association between hallucinations and overestimation 
of performance, although the cross-sectional findings are inconsistent. This 
inconsistency may relate to the fluctuating hallucinatory experiences that are 
not captured in cross-sectional studies. Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) 
captures in-the-moment experiences over time so can identify causal 
relationships between variables such as the associations between metacognition 
and hallucinatory experience in daily life and overcome problems in 
cross-sectional designs.
METHODS: Participants (N = 41) experiencing daily hallucinations completed 
baseline questionnaires and smartphone surveys 7 times per day for 14 days. They 
were prompted to identify a task they would complete in the next 4 h and to make 
metacognitive predictions around the likelihood of completing the task, the 
difficulty of the task, and how well they would complete it (standard of 
completion).
RESULTS: 76 % finished the 14-days of assessment with an average of 42.2 % 
survey completion. Less accurate metacognition was associated with more 
hallucinations, but less accurate likelihood and standard of completion was 
associated with fewer hallucinations. Using a cross-lagged analysis, 
metacognitive predictions around the likelihood of completion (p < .001) and 
standard of completion (p = .01) predicted hallucination intensity at the 
following timepoint, and metacognitive predictions regarding likelihood of 
completion (p = .02) predicted hallucination control at the following timepoint.
DISCUSSION: Interventions that aim to improve metacognitive ability 
in-the-moment may serve to reduce the intensity and increase the control of 
hallucinations.

The Role of the Context of Physical Activity for Its Association with Affective 
Well-Being: An Experience Sampling Study in Young Adults.

Li YM(1), Hachenberger J(1), Lemola S(1)(2).

Physical activity and being outdoors both improve affective well-being. However, 
little is known about the synergistic effects between them and the influences of 
contextual factors such as the life domain of physical activity (work-, chores-, 
leisure, or sports-related) or the type of the outdoor environment (green space, 
blue space, or city area) on mood. This study investigates the synergistic 
effects of physical activity and being outdoors as well as the potential role of 
contextual factors on mood. A total of 158 individuals aged 18-25 years (133 
females) participated in a 14-day experience sampling study. Participants 
received seven prompts per day and answered questions about their physical 
activity, contextual factors, and affective well-being. Physical activity and 
being outdoors were associated with concurrent higher levels of positive and 
lower levels of negative affect compared to being physically inactive or being 
indoors, respectively. However, no synergistic effects were found. Being 
outdoors in a city area was associated with a less positive and more negative 
affect than being in nature. Work- and chores-related physical activity was 
associated with less positive affect and more negative affect compared to 
sports- or leisure-related physical activity. To foster positive affect, people 
should schedule leisure-related physical activity in nature.

Crystal structure of a Burkholderia peptidase and modification of the 
substrate-binding site for enhanced hydrolytic activity toward gluten-derived 
pro-immunogenic peptides.

Liu YY(1), Lin IC(2), Chen PC(2), Lee CC(2), Meng M(3).

Celiac disease (CD) is a human autoimmune disease triggered by toxic gluten 
peptides. Recently, oral enzyme therapy has been proposed to ameliorate the 
health condition of CD patients based on the concept of removing 
pepsin-insensitive gluten-derived pro-immunogenic peptides. A Burkholderia 
peptidase, Bga1903, with promising gluten-degrading activity was characterized 
previously. Here, we report the crystal structure of Bga1903, in which the core 
has a α/β/α fold featured with a twisted six-stranded parallel β-sheet 
sandwiched between two layers of α-helices. The mutations at the 
substrate-binding pocket that might enhance the peptidase's affinity toward 
tetrapeptide PQPQ were predicted by FoldX. Accordingly, four single-substitution 
mutants, G351A, E380L, S386F, and S387L, were created. The specificity constant 
(kcat/KM) of wild type toward chromogenic peptidyl substrates Z-HPK-pNA, 
Z-HPQ-pNA, Z-HPL-pNA, and Z-QPQ-pNA are 30.2, 7.9, 3.3, and 0.79 s-1·mM-1, 
respectively, indicating that the QPQ motif, which frequently occurs in 
pro-immunogenic peptides, is not favorable. Among the mutants, E380L loses the 
hydrolytic activity toward Z-HPK-pNA, suggesting a critical role of E380 in 
preferring a lysine residue at the P1 position. S387L shows a 17-fold increase 
in the specificity constant toward Z-QPQ-pNA and hydrolyzes the pro-immunogenic 
peptides more efficiently than the wild-type peptidase.

Temperature Dependence of Thermal Properties of Ex Vivo Porcine Heart and Lung 
in Hyperthermia and Ablative Temperature Ranges.

Bianchi L(1), Bontempi M(1), De Simone S(1), Franceschet M(1), Saccomandi P(2).

Erratum in
    Ann Biomed Eng. 2023 May;51(5):1119.

This work proposes the characterization of the temperature dependence of the 
thermal properties of heart and lung tissues from room temperature up 
to > 90 °C. The thermal diffusivity (α), thermal conductivity (k), and 
volumetric heat capacity (Cv) of ex vivo porcine hearts and deflated lungs were 
measured with a dual-needle sensor technique. α and k associated with heart 
tissue remained almost constant until ~ 70 and ~ 80 °C, accordingly. 
Above ~ 80 °C, a more substantial variation in these thermal properties was 
registered: at 94 °C, α and k respectively experienced a 2.3- and 1.5- fold 
increase compared to their nominal values, showing average values of 0.346 mm2/s 
and 0.828 W/(m·K), accordingly. Conversely, Cv was almost constant until 55 °C 
and decreased afterward (e.g., Cv = 2.42 MJ/(m3·K) at 94 °C). Concerning the 
lung tissue, both its α and k were characterized by an exponential increase with 
temperature, showing a marked increment at supraphysiological and ablative 
temperatures (at 91 °C, α and k were equal to 2.120 mm2/s and 2.721 W/(m·K), 
respectively, i.e., 13.7- and 13.1-fold higher compared to their baseline 
values). Regression analysis was performed to attain the best-fit curves 
interpolating the measured data, thus providing models of the temperature 
dependence of the investigated properties. These models can be useful for 
increasing the accuracy of simulation-based preplanning frameworks of 
interventional thermal procedures, and the realization of tissue-mimicking 
materials.

Why should orchidopexy be performed in congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, 
and when?

Bensalah-Hammoutene M, Van Vliet G.

BACKGROUND: In otherwise normal boys with undescended testes, early orchidopexy 
is recommended to preserve fertility, to decrease the risk of testicular cancer 
and to facilitate its detection. Indeed, compared to the general population, the 
risk of testicular cancer is increased two to eight-fold in isolated 
cryptorchidism and usually occurs before the age of 40 years. By contrast, when 
cryptorchidism is associated with congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, the 
risk of testicular cancer is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the characteristics of testicular cancer when 
cryptorchidism is associated with congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.
METHODS: PUBMED research without date limits including the following key words: 
hypogonadism, hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism, testicular cancer, testicular germ 
cell tumors, undescended testis, Kallmann syndrome, FSH, AFP (α foeto protein), 
βHCG.
RESULTS: Only three patients with testicular cancer and congenital 
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism have been published in the past four decades and 
cancer was diagnosed at 18.6, 50 and 64 years.
CONCLUSION: Gonadotropin deficiency may protect against testicular cancer and 
orchidopexy in this context may be deferred.

Atopic Dermatitis Mediates the Association Between an IL4RA Variant and Food 
Allergy in School-Aged Children.

Banzon TM(1), Kelly MS(2), Bartnikas LM(1), Sheehan WJ(3), Cunningham A(4), Harb 
H(1), Crestani E(1), Valeri L(5), Greco KF(6), Chatila TA(1), Phipatanakul W(7), 
Lai PS(8).

BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) and food allergy (FA) may share genetic risk 
factors. It is unknown whether genetic factors directly cause FA or are mediated 
through AD, as the dual-allergen hypothesis suggests.
OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that AD mediates the relationship between an 
IL-4 receptor alpha chain gene (IL4RA) variant, the human IL-4 receptor alpha 
chain protein-R576 polymorphism, and FA.
METHODS: A total of 433 children with asthma enrolled in the School Inner-City 
Asthma Study underwent genotyping for the IL4RA576 allele. Surveys were 
administered to determine FA, AD, and associated allergic responses. Mediation 
analysis was performed adjusting for race and ethnicity, age, sex, and household 
income. Multivariate models were used to determine the association between 
genotype and FA severity.
RESULTS: AD was reported in 193 (45%) and FA in 80 children (19%). Each risk 
allele increased odds of AD 1.39-fold ([1.03-1.87], P = .03), and AD increased 
odds of FA 3.67-fold ([2.05- 6.57], P < .01). There was an indirect effect of 
genotype, mediated by AD, predicting FA; each risk allele increased the odds of 
FA by 1.13 (odds ratio [95% CI], Q/R = 1.13 [1.02-1.24], R/R = 1.28 [1.04-1.51]; 
P < .01). Each risk allele increased the odds of severe FA symptoms 2.68-fold 
([1.26-5.71], P = .01).
CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of children with asthma, AD is part of the causal 
pathway between an IL4RA variant and FA. This variant is associated with 
increased risk of severe FA reactions. Addressing AD in children with an IL4RA 
polymorphism may modulate the risk of FA.

Global meta-analysis of soil hydraulic properties on the same soils with 
differing land use.

Robinson DA(1), Nemes A(2), Reinsch S(3), Radbourne A(3), Bentley L(3), Keith 
AM(4).

Global land use change has resulted in more pasture and cropland, largely at the 
expense of woodlands, over the last 300 years. How this change affects soil 
hydraulic function with regard to feedbacks to the hydrological cycle is unclear 
for earth system modelling (ESM). Pedotransfer functions (PTFs) used to predict 
soil hydraulic conductivity (K) take no account of land use. Here, we synthesize 
>800 measurements from around the globe from sites that measured near-saturated 
soil hydraulic conductivity, or infiltration, at the soil surface, on the same 
soil type at each location, but with differing land use, woodland (W), grassland 
(G) and cropland (C). We found that texture based PTFs predict K reasonably well 
for cropland giving unbiased results, but increasingly underestimate K in 
grassland and woodland. In native woodland and grassland differences in K can 
usually be accounted for by differences in bulk density. However, heavy grazing 
K responses can be much lower indicating compaction likely reduces connectivity. 
We show that the K response ratios (RR) between land uses vary with cropland 
(C/W = 0.45 [W/C = 2.2]) and grassland (G/W = 0.63 [W/G = 1.6]) having about 
half the K of woodland.

[Determination of content of nine components in Xinnaojian preparations from 
different manufacturers by QAMS].

[Article in Chinese]

Wang Z(1), Zhao JF(2), Zan K(1), Li HL(1), Jin HY(1), Ma SC(1).

This study established the ultra-performance liquid chromatography(UPLC) 
fingerprint of Xinnaojian preparations. With epicatechin gallate as the internal 
reference substance, a quantitative analysis of multi-components by single 
marker(QAMS) method for determining the content of nine components(gallic acid, 
epigallocatechin, catechin, caffeine, epicatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, 
gallocatechin gallate, epicatechin gallate, and catechin gallate) in Xinnaojian 
preparations was established. The content determined by the external standard 
method(ESM) and QAMS method was compared to evaluate the feasibility and 
accuracy of QAMS method. The results showed that the standard curves of nine 
components had good linear relationship within the test concentration ranges. 
The average recoveries were 87.57%-107.4%, and the RSD was 1.5%-2.9%. Except 
epigallocatechin, the other components showed good repeatability under different 
experimental conditions. Epigallocatechin could meet the requirements in the 
same instrument and at the same wavelength. The results generally showed no 
significant difference between QAMS and ESM. The content of 9 components varied 
between the samples from different manufacturers, while it showed no significant 
difference between the samples from the same manufacturer. In summary, the UPLC 
fingerprint combined with QAMS method is feasible and accurate for determining 
the content of the nine components, which can be used for rapid quality 
evaluation of Xinnaojian preparations.

Correlating Nanoscale Structures with Electrochemical Properties of Solid 
Electrolyte Interphases in Solid-State Battery Electrodes.

Oh J(1)(2), Park G(1), Kim H(1), Kim S(3), Shin DO(2), Kim KM(2), Byon HR(3), 
Lee YG(2), Hong S(1).

Here, we investigate the nonlinear relationship between the content of solid 
electrolytes in composite electrodes and the irreversible capacity via the 
degree of nanoscale uniformity of the surface morphology and chemical 
composition of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. Using 
electrochemical strain microscopy (ESM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 
(XPS), changes of the chemical composition and morphology (Li and F 
distribution) in SEI layers on the electrodes as a function of solid electrolyte 
contents are analyzed. As a result, we find that the solid electrolyte content 
affects the variation of the SEI layer thickness and chemical distributions of 
Li and F ions in the SEI layer, which, in turn, influence the Coulombic 
efficiency. This correlation determines the composition of the composite 
electrode surface that can maximize the physical and chemical uniformity of the 
solid electrolyte on the electrode, which is a key parameter to increase 
electrochemical performance in solid-state batteries.

What Is an Extreme Sports Healthcare Provider: An Auto-Ethnographic Study of the 
Development of an Extreme Sports Medicine Training Program.

Trease L(1)(2), Albert E(1), Singleman G(1), Brymer E(3).

"I remember when sex was safe and skydiving was dangerous" read a popular bumper 
sticker during the HIV crisis. Popular perceptions of extreme sport (ES) often 
include the descriptor 'dangerous'. Therefore, why is the popularity of ES 
increasing exponentially with "dedicated TV channels, internet sites, 
high-rating competitions, and high-profile sponsors drawing more participants"? 
More importantly, how should health practitioners respond to the influx of ES 
athletes with novel injuries, enquiries and attitudes. This paper describes the 
results of a collaborative auto-ethnographic approach to answering "what is an 
extreme sports medicine health care provider and what are the components of an 
effective Extreme Sports Medicine (ESM) training program?" The study was 
conducted following the first ESM university course offered in Australia with 
the intention of assessing the learning design and reflecting on the development 
and practice of ES health practitioners. We explicated three overarching themes 
common to both the ES health practitioner and for the effective training of 
healthcare providers in the support of ES endeavors and athletes. These themes 
were individual, task and environmental factors. The impacts of these findings 
confirm that ESM courses are vital and should be designed specifically to ensure 
that practitioners are effectively supported to develop the unique skills 
necessary for practice in real world extreme sports events.

Nationwide evaluation of energy and indoor air quality predictive control and 
impact on infection risk for cooling season.

Wang X(1), Dong B(1), Zhang JJ(1).

Since the coronavirus disease 2019, the extended time indoors makes people more 
concerned about indoor air quality, while the increased ventilation in seeks of 
reducing infection probability has increased the energy usage from heating, 
ventilation, and air-conditioning systems. In this study, to represent the 
dynamics of indoor temperature and air quality, a coupled grey-box model is 
developed. The model is identified and validated using a data-driven approach 
and real-time measured data of a campus office. To manage building energy usage 
and indoor air quality, a model predictive control strategy is proposed and 
developed. The simulation study demonstrated 18.92% energy saving while 
maintaining good indoor air quality at the testing site. Two nationwide 
simulation studies assessed the overall energy saving potential and the impact 
on the infection probability of the proposed strategy in different climate 
zones. The results showed 20%-40% energy saving in general while maintaining a 
predetermined indoor air quality setpoint. Although the infection risk is 
increased due to the reduced ventilation rate, it is still less than the 
suggested threshold (2%) in general.

Asynchronising five-fold symmetry sequence for better homonuclear polarisation 
transfer in magic-angle-spinning solid-state NMR.

Arunachalam V(1), Sharma K(2), Mote KR(3), Madhu PK(4).

Recoupling, decoupling, and multidimensional correlation experiments in 
magic-angle-spinning (MAS) solid-state NMR can be designed by exploiting the 
symmetry of internal spin interactions. One such scheme, namely, C521, and its 
supercycled version SPC521, notated as a five-fold symmetry sequence, is widely 
used for double-quantum dipole-dipole recoupling. Such schemes are generally 
rotor synchronised by design. We demonstrate an asynchronous implementation of 
the SPC521 sequence leading to higher double-quantum homonuclear polarisation 
transfer efficiency compared to the normal synchronous implementation. 
Rotor-synchronisation is broken in two different ways: lengthening the duration 
of one of the pulses, denoted as pulse-width variation (PWV), and mismatching 
the MAS frequency denoted as MAS variation (MASV). The application of this 
asynchronous sequence is shown on three different samples, namely, U-13C-alanine 
and 1,4-13C-labelled ammonium phthalate which include 13Cα-13Cβ, 13Cα-13Co, and 
13Co-13Co spin systems, and adenosine 5'- triphosphate disodium salt trihydrate 
(ATP⋅3H2O). We show that the asynchronous version performs better for spin pairs 
with small dipole-dipole couplings and large chemical-shift anisotropies, for 
example, 13Co-13Co. Simulations and experiments are shown to corroborate the 
results.

Effects of Lumbar Stabilization Exercises on Isokinetic Strength and Muscle 
Tension in Sedentary Men.

Yeom S(1)(2), Jeong H(2), Lee H(1)(2)(3), Jeon K(1)(2)(3)(4)(5).

Lumbar stabilization exercises (LSE) lead to high levels of erector spinae 
muscle (ESM) activation, which has a positive effect on improving physical 
function. The purpose of this study is to identify factors explaining changes in 
muscle strength after 7 weeks of LSE and to evaluate changes in stiffness and 
contraction of the ESM. All participants (male: n = 42, age = 28.26 ± 10.97) 
were assessed for 60°/s isokinetic extensor muscle strength and tension using a 
tensiomyography (TMG) and isokinetic device before and after LSE. Maximum 
displacement (Dm) and average velocity up to 90% Dm (Vc 90) were significantly 
different before and after LSE. Additionally, participants' 60°/s isokinetic 
extensor strength was significantly higher after exercise. A regression analysis 
was conducted to test the explanatory power of the variables, and positive 
results were obtained in the increase in extensor strength before and after Vc 
90 and LSE. Furthermore, statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. After 
LSE, the increase in 60°/s isokinetic extensor strength and ESM's Dm and Vc 90 
can be interpreted as positive changes post-exercise in endurance muscles with a 
higher percentage of type I fibers. Our results can contribute to predicting the 
long-term exercise effect in sedentary workers and developing an individualized 
strategic exercise program.

Screening of α-amino acid ester acyl transferase variant with improved activity 
by combining rational and random mutagenesis.

Abe I(1)(2), Tagami U(1), Kashiwagi T(1), Sugiyama M(1), Suzuki SI(1), Takagi 
H(2), Yokozeki K(1).

Random and rational mutagenesis of an α-amino acid ester acyl transferase from 
Sphingobacterium siyangensis AJ2458 (SAET) was conducted to examine the 
production of aspartame, an α-l-aspartyl-l-phenylalanine methyl ester. We 
previously reported aspartame production via combination of enzymatic and 
chemical methods. However, the productivity of the aspartame intermediate by 
SAET was approximately one-fifth that of l-alanyl-l-glutamine (Ala-Gln), whose 
production method has already been established. Here, to improve the enzymatic 
activity of SAET, we performed random mutagenesis in the gene encoding SAET and 
obtained 10 mutations that elevated the enzymatic activity (1.2- to 1.7-fold 
increase) relative to that of wild-type SAET. To further improve the activity, 
we performed mutagenesis to optimize the combination of the obtained mutations 
and finally selected one SAET variant with 10 amino acid substitutions (M35-4 
SAET). An Escherichia coli strain overexpressing M35-4 SAET displayed a 5.7-fold 
higher activity than that of the wild-type SAET, which was almost equal to that 
of Ala-Gln by an E. coli strain overexpressing wild-type SAET. The Vmax value of 
M35-4 SAET was 2.0-fold greater, and its thermostability was higher than those 
of wild-type SAET. These results suggest that the obtained SAET variants 
contribute to improvement in aspartame production.

Serial increase and high alpha-fetoprotein levels predict the risk of 
hepatocellular carcinoma in 6 months.

Su TH(1)(2), Chang SH(3), Chen CL(4), Liao SH(4)(5), Tseng TC(2)(6), Hsu 
SJ(1)(2), Hong CM(7), Liu CH(1)(2), Yang HC(1), Liu CJ(1)(2), Chen 
PJ(1)(2)(4)(5), Kao JH(1)(2)(4)(5).

AIM: Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) checkup with abdominal ultrasonography for 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance remains controversial. We evaluated 
serial AFP-increase and high AFP levels in prediction of HCC.
METHODS: At risk patients with chronic liver disease underwent HCC surveillance 
with trimonthly AFP measurement were included and categorized into HCC and 
non-HCC groups. Their AFP levels at 12, 9, and 6 months (-6M) before the outcome 
date were evaluated. Group based trajectory analysis and multivariable 
regression analysis were performed to identify AFP trajectories as risk 
predictors for HCC.
RESULTS: Overall, 2776 patients were included in the HCC (n = 326) and non-HCC 
(n = 2450) groups. Serial AFP levels were significantly higher in the HCC than 
the non-HCC groups. Trajectory analysis identified AFP-increase group (11%) 
increased 24-fold risks of HCC compared with the AFP-stable (89%) group. 
Compared with patients without AFP-increase, a serial 3-month AFP-increase ≥10% 
elevated HCC risk by 12.1-fold (95% CI: 6.5-22.4) in 6 months, and the HCC risks 
increased 13-60 folds in patients with cirrhosis, hepatitis B, or C receiving 
antiviral therapy, or AFP levels <20 ng/mL. Combining serial AFP-increase ≥10% 
and AFP ≥20 ng/mL at -6M significantly increased 41.7-fold (95% CI: 13.8-126.2) 
HCC risks. In patients underwent biannual AFP checkups, those with both 6-month 
AFP-increase ≥10% and AFP ≥20 ng/mL increased 22.1-fold (95% CI: 12.52-39.16) 
HCC risks in 6 months. Most HCCs were detected at an early stage.
CONCLUSIONS: Serial 3-to-6-month AFP-increase of ≥10% previously and AFP level 
of ≥20 ng/mL significantly increased HCC risks in 6 months. This article is

Enzyme Substrate Prediction from Three-Dimensional Feature Representations Using 
Space-Filling Curves.

Rappoport D(1), Jinich A(2).

Compact and interpretable structural feature representations are required for 
accurately predicting properties and function of proteins. In this work, we 
construct and evaluate three-dimensional feature representations of protein 
structures based on space-filling curves (SFCs). We focus on the problem of 
enzyme substrate prediction, using two ubiquitous enzyme families as case 
studies: the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases (SDRs) and the 
S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases (SAM-MTases). Space-filling 
curves such as the Hilbert curve and the Morton curve generate a reversible 
mapping from discretized three-dimensional to one-dimensional representations 
and thus help to encode three-dimensional molecular structures in a 
system-independent way and with only a few adjustable parameters. Using 
three-dimensional structures of SDRs and SAM-MTases generated using AlphaFold2, 
we assess the performance of the SFC-based feature representations in 
predictions on a new benchmark database of enzyme classification tasks including 
their cofactor and substrate selectivity. Gradient-boosted tree classifiers 
yield binary prediction accuracy of 0.77-0.91 and area under curve (AUC) 
characteristics of 0.83-0.92 for the classification tasks. We investigate the 
effects of amino acid encoding, spatial orientation, and (the few) parameters of 
SFC-based encodings on the accuracy of the predictions. Our results suggest that 
geometry-based approaches such as SFCs are promising for generating protein 
structural representations and are complementary to the existing protein feature 
representations such as evolutionary scale modeling (ESM) sequence embeddings.

Temporal associations between objectively measured physical activity and 
depressive symptoms: An experience sampling study.

Li YM(1), Konstabel K(2)(3), Mõttus R(3)(4), Lemola S(1)(5).

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to examine the relationship between the timing of 
physical activity and within-individual differences in depressive symptoms, 
positive affect, and negative affect in individuals with different baseline 
levels of depressive symptoms.
METHODS: Experience sampling methodology (ESM) was used to measure real-time 
depressive symptoms, positive affect, and negative affect in a convenience 
sample of 78 healthy adults (aged M = 25.46 years, SD = 6.18; 57 females) five 
times per day for 14 days. We measured physical activity throughout the 14 days 
by using activity sensors. Baseline levels of depressive symptoms were assessed 
with the PHQ-9 to build subgroups with low vs. mild-moderate depressive 
symptoms.
RESULTS: Physical activity predicted decreased depressive symptom levels, 
negative affect, and increased positive affect. Associations were stronger for 
individuals with higher baseline levels of depressive symptoms and for physical 
activity between 0 and 30 min compared to physical activity between 30 and 180 
min before the mood rating. Conversely, levels of depressive symptoms, positive 
and negative affect did not predict physical activity.
LIMITATIONS: The convenience sample may not have been representative of the 
general population or people with depression. Accelerometers may not have 
detected some types of physical activities such as bicycling. Causality could 
not be inferred because of the observational study design.
CONCLUSION: Individuals with higher levels of depressive symptoms may benefit 
from physical activity. While the effects were strongest for physical activity 
immediately before the mood ratings, the effects were in the same direction for 
up to 3 h before the mood ratings.

A prefix and attention map discrimination fusion guided attention for biomedical 
named entity recognition.

Guan Z(1), Zhou X(2).

BACKGROUND: The biomedical literature is growing rapidly, and it is increasingly 
important to extract meaningful information from the vast amount of literature. 
Biomedical named entity recognition (BioNER) is one of the key and fundamental 
tasks in biomedical text mining. It also acts as a primitive step for many 
downstream applications such as relation extraction and knowledge base 
completion. Therefore, the accurate identification of entities in biomedical 
literature has certain research value. However, this task is challenging due to 
the insufficiency of sequence labeling and the lack of large-scale labeled 
training data and domain knowledge.
RESULTS: In this paper, we use a novel word-pair classification method, design a 
simple attention mechanism and propose a novel architecture to solve the 
research difficulties of BioNER more efficiently without leveraging any external 
knowledge. Specifically, we break down the limitations of sequence 
labeling-based approaches by predicting the relationship between word pairs. 
Based on this, we enhance the pre-trained model BioBERT, through the proposed 
prefix and attention map dscrimination fusion guided attention and propose the 
E-BioBERT. Our proposed attention differentiates the distribution of different 
heads in different layers in the BioBERT, which enriches the diversity of 
self-attention. Our model is superior to state-of-the-art compared models on 
five available datasets: BC4CHEMD, BC2GM, BC5CDR-Disease, BC5CDR-Chem, and 
NCBI-Disease, achieving F1-score of 92.55%, 85.45%, 87.53%, 94.16% and 90.55%, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Compared with many previous various models, our method does not 
require additional training datasets, external knowledge, and complex training 
process. The experimental results on five BioNER benchmark datasets demonstrate 
that our model is better at mining semantic information, alleviating the problem 
of label inconsistency, and has higher entity recognition ability. More 
importantly, we analyze and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed 
attention.

Development of benchmark datasets for text mining and sentiment analysis to 
accelerate regulatory literature review.

Wu L(1), Chen S(2), Guo L(2), Shpyleva S(2), Harris K(3), Fahmi T(4), Flanigan 
T(5), Tong W(6), Xu J(6), Ren Z(7).

In the field of regulatory science, reviewing literature is an essential and 
important step, which most of the time is conducted by manually reading hundreds 
of articles. Although this process is highly time-consuming and labor-intensive, 
most output of this process is not well transformed into machine-readable 
format. The limited availability of data has largely constrained the artificial 
intelligence (AI) system development to facilitate this literature reviewing in 
the regulatory process. In the past decade, AI has revolutionized the area of 
text mining as many deep learning approaches have been developed to search, 
annotate, and classify relevant documents. After the great advancement of AI 
algorithms, a lack of high-quality data instead of the algorithms has recently 
become the bottleneck of AI system development. Herein, we constructed two large 
benchmark datasets, Chlorine Efficacy dataset (CHE) and Chlorine Safety dataset 
(CHS), under a regulatory scenario that sought to assess the antiseptic efficacy 
and toxicity of chlorine. For each dataset, ∼10,000 scientific articles were 
initially collected, manually reviewed, and their relevance to the review task 
were labeled. To ensure high data quality, each paper was labeled by a consensus 
among multiple experienced reviewers. The overall relevance rate was 27.21% 
(2,663 of 9,788) for CHE and 7.50% (761 of 10,153) for CHS, respectively. 
Furthermore, the relevant articles were categorized into five subgroups based on 
the focus of their content. Next, we developed an attention-based classification 
language model using these two datasets. The proposed classification model 
yielded 0.857 and 0.908 of Area Under the Curve (AUC) for CHE and CHS dataset, 
respectively. This performance was significantly better than permutation test 
(p < 10E-9), demonstrating that the labeling processes were valid. To conclude, 
our datasets can be used as benchmark to develop AI systems, which can further 
facilitate the literature review process in regulatory science.

The Qwantify app dataset: A remote experience sampling study of desire, emotion, 
and well-being.

Wilson-Mendenhall CD(1), Condon P(2), Hasenkamp W(3), MacKerron G(4), Quigley 
KS(5), Barrett LF(5).

Experiences of desire-the feeling of wanting to have, do, or experience 
something-are pervasive and varied. Recent theoretical advances draw attention 
to characterizing this variation. Thus, this study investigated experiences of 
desire in everyday life and co-occurring social, physical, and emotional states, 
including facets of emotional experiences known to be related to well-being 
(e.g., perceived loneliness and stress). The Qwantify app was designed to run a 
remote experience sampling study. Through the app, participants were randomly 
alerted during their daily life to report on their experience in the moment. 
During the data collection period, any individual could download the freely 
available Qwantify app and participate in the study, without providing 
identifying information or communicating with researchers. Similar to other 
remote experience sampling studies, an incentive for participants to engage in 
the study was unlocking visualizations of their own data. Over 600 participants 
downloaded the app, completed the sign-up process, and responded to at least one 
experience sampling alert. Approximately 40% of these participants went on to 
respond to 50 alerts. The purpose of this report is to describe this experience 
sampling dataset such that it can be used to test a variety of hypotheses, 
including hypotheses regarding individual differences.

Projected 21st-century changes in marine heterotrophic bacteria under climate 
change.

Kim HH(1), Laufkötter C(2)(3), Lovato T(4), Doney SC(5), Ducklow HW(6).

Marine heterotrophic Bacteria (or referred to as bacteria) play an important 
role in the ocean carbon cycle by utilizing, respiring, and remineralizing 
organic matter exported from the surface to deep ocean. Here, we investigate the 
responses of bacteria to climate change using a three-dimensional coupled ocean 
biogeochemical model with explicit bacterial dynamics as part of the Coupled 
Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6. First, we assess the credibility of the 
century-scale projections (2015-2099) of bacterial carbon stock and rates in the 
upper 100 m layer using skill scores and compilations of the measurements for 
the contemporary period (1988-2011). Second, we demonstrate that across 
different climate scenarios, the simulated bacterial biomass trends (2076-2099) 
are sensitive to the regional trends in temperature and organic carbon stocks. 
Bacterial carbon biomass declines by 5-10% globally, while it increases by 3-5% 
in the Southern Ocean where semi-labile dissolved organic carbon (DOC) stocks 
are relatively low and particle-attached bacteria dominate. While a full 
analysis of drivers underpinning the simulated changes in all bacterial stock 
and rates is not possible due to data constraints, we investigate the mechanisms 
of the changes in DOC uptake rates of free-living bacteria using the first-order 
Taylor decomposition. The results demonstrate that the increase in semi-labile 
DOC stocks drives the increase in DOC uptake rates in the Southern Ocean, while 
the increase in temperature drives the increase in DOC uptake rates in the 
northern high and low latitudes. Our study provides a systematic analysis of 
bacteria at global scale and a critical step toward a better understanding of 
how bacteria affect the functioning of the biological carbon pump and 
partitioning of organic carbon pools between surface and deep layers.

Genetic overlap between midfrontal theta signals and ADHD and ASD in a 
longitudinal twin cohort.

Aydin Ü(1), Gyurkovics M(2), Ginestet C(3), Capp S(4), Greven CU(5), Palmer 
J(6), McLoughlin G(7).

BACKGROUND: Cognitive control has been strongly linked to midfrontal theta (4-8 
Hz) brain activity. Such control processes are known to be impaired in those 
with psychiatric conditions, and neurodevelopmental diagnoses, including 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder 
(ASD). Temporal variability in theta in particular is associated with ADHD with 
shared genetic variance underlying the relationship. Here, we investigated the 
phenotypic and genetic relationships between theta phase variability, 
theta-related signals (N2, ERN, Pe), reaction time, and ADHD and ASD 
longitudinally in a large twin study of young adults to investigate the 
stability of the genetic relationships between these measures over time.
METHODS: Genetic multivariate liability threshold models were run on a 
longitudinal sample of 566 participants (283 twin pairs). Characteristics of 
ADHD and ASD were measured in childhood and in young adulthood, while EEG was 
recorded in young adulthood during an arrow flanker task.
RESULTS: Cross-trial theta phase variability in adulthood showed large positive 
phenotypic and genetic relationships with reaction time variability and both 
childhood and adult ADHD characteristics. Pe amplitude was negatively related 
phenotypically and genetically to ADHD and ASD at both time points.
CONCLUSIONS: We show significant genetic associations between variability in 
theta signalling and ADHD. In a novel finding, we show that these relationships 
are stable across time, indicating a core dysregulation of the temporal 
coordination of control processes in ADHD that persists in those with childhood 
symptoms. Error processing, indexed by the Pe, was altered in both ADHD and ASD, 
with a strong genetic contribution.

Exploring the autism spectrum: Moderating effects of neuroticism on stress 
reactivity and on the association between social context and negative affect.

van Oosterhout J(1), van der Linden K(1)(2), Simons CJP(1)(2), van Amelsvoort 
T(2), Marcelis M(1)(2).

Neuroticism is associated with increased stress reactivity. In autism spectrum 
disorders (ASD), emotional stress reactivity is increased and there is some 
evidence for an increased negative affect (NA) when with less familiar people. 
The aim of this study was to compare adults with ASD and controls on levels of 
neuroticism and on interactions between neuroticism and appraised stress or 
social context in models of NA. This is a cross-sectional observational study 
comprising a group of 50 adults with ASD and 51 controls. Experience sampling 
method (ESM) reports were collected for 10 days to measure daily life stress, 
mood, and social context. Multilevel regression analyses revealed significantly 
higher neuroticism levels in ASD than in controls. Adults with ASD who scored 
high on neuroticism showed a significantly stronger association between 
activity/social stress and NA (i.e., higher stress reactivity) than those with 
low scores. Furthermore, the association between neuroticism and NA was stronger 
when adults with ASD were with less familiar people compared with being alone or 
with familiar people. No consistent corresponding significant interactions were 
found in the control group. In conclusion, in ASD, neuroticism moderates the 
association between appraised stress and NA as well as the association between 
social context and NA.

Biphasic Dose-Response of Mn-Induced Mitochondrial Damage, PINK1/Parkin 
Expression, and Mitophagy in SK-N-SH Cells.

Zhang Y(1)(2), Hu HT(2), Cao YM(3), Jiang ZG(2), Liu J(4), Fan QY(2)(5).

Excessive manganese (Mn) exposure produces neurotoxicity with mitochondrial 
damage. Mitophagy is a protective mechanism to eliminate damaged mitochondria to 
protect cells. The aim of this study was to determine the dose-response of 
Mn-induced mitochondria damage, the expression of mitophagy-mediated protein 
PINK1/Parkin and mitophagy in dopamine-producing SK-N-SH cells. Cells were 
exposed to 0, 300, 900, and 1500 μM Mn2+ for 24 h, and ROS production, 
mitochondrial damage and mitophagy were examined. The levels of dopamine were 
detected by ELISA and neurotoxicity and mitophagy-related proteins (α-synuclein, 
PINK1, Parkin, Optineurin, and LC3II/I) were detected by western blot. Mn 
increased intracellular ROS and apoptosis and decreased mitochondrial membrane 
potential in a concentration-dependent manner. However, at the low dose of 
300 μM Mn, autophagosome was increased 11-fold, but at the high dose of 1500 μM, 
autophagosome was attenuated to 4-fold, together with decreased 
mitophagy-mediated protein PINK1/Parkin and LC3II/I ratio and increased 
Optineurin expression, resulting in increased α-synuclein accumulation and 
decreased dopamine production. Thus, Mn-induced mitophagy exhibited a novel 
biphasic regulation: at the low dose, mitophagy is activated to eliminate 
damaged mitochondria, however, at the high dose, cells gradually loss the 
adaptive machinery, the PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy weakened, resulting in 
neurotoxicity.

Daphnetin alleviates neuropathic pain in chronic constrictive injury rats via 
regulating the NF-κB dependent CXCL1/CXCR2 signaling pathway.

Zhang T(1), Liang W(1), Ou W(1), Zhang M(1), Cui S(1), Zhang S(1).

CONTEXT: Daphnetin is a natural product with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and 
neuroprotective properties. Reports have found that it has a strong analgesic 
effect; however, its analgesic mechanism is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: We explored the effect and mechanism of daphnetin on neuropathic pain 
(NP).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The rat model of NP was established by ligation of the 
sciatic nerve. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six groups: Control, 
Model, Sham, morphine (0.375 mg/kg), and daphnetin (0.0625 and 0.025 mg/kg). 
Rats were intrathecally injected with drugs or normal saline once daily for 
three days. Hyperalgesia was evaluated by mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT) 
and thermal withdrawal threshold (TWT). Protein levels were detected using 
ELISA, immunofluorescence, and western blotting.
RESULTS: Compared to the Model group, daphnetin improved TWT (46.70 °C vs. 
42.20 °C) and MWT (45.60 g vs. 23.60 g), reduced the expression of 
interleukin-1β (0.99 ng/g vs. 1.42 ng/g), interleukin-6 (0.90 ng/g vs. 
1.52 ng/g), and tumor necrosis factor-α (0.93 ng/g vs. 1.52 ng/g) in the sciatic 
nerve. Daphnetin decreased the expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) 
(0.47-fold), phosphorylated inhibitor of NF-κB (p-IKBα) (0.29-fold), nuclear 
factor kappaB (NF-κB) (0.48-fold), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) 
(0.42-fold), CXC chemokine ligand type 1 (CXCL1) (0.84-fold), CXC chemokine 
receptor type 2 (CXCR2) (0.78-fold) in the spinal cord.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Daphnetin alleviates NP by inhibiting inflammation 
and astrocyte activation in the spinal cord, providing theoretical support for 
the extensive clinical treatment of NP.

Reversible switching between two common protein folds in a designed system using 
only temperature.

Solomon TL(1)(2), He Y(1), Sari N(1), Chen Y(1), Gallagher DT(1)(3), Bryan 
PN(1)(4), Orban J(1)(2).

Naturally occurring metamorphic proteins have the ability to interconvert from 
one folded state to another through either a limited set of mutations or by way 
of a change in the local environment. Here, we show in a designed system that it 
is possible to switch reversibly between two of the most common monomeric folds 
employing only temperature changes. We demonstrate that a latent 3α state can be 
unmasked from an α/β-plait topology with a single V90T amino acid substitution, 
populating both forms simultaneously. The equilibrium between these two states 
exhibits temperature dependence, such that the 3α state is predominant (>90%) at 
5 °C, while the α/β-plait fold is the major species (>90%) at 30 °C. We describe 
the structure and dynamics of these topologies, how mutational changes affect 
the temperature dependence, and the energetics and kinetics of interconversion. 
Additionally, we demonstrate how ligand-binding function can be tightly 
regulated by large amplitude changes in protein structure over a relatively 
narrow temperature range that is relevant to biology. The 3α/αβ switch thus 
represents a potentially useful approach for designing proteins that alter their 
fold topologies in response to environmental triggers. It may also serve as a 
model for computational studies of temperature-dependent protein stability and 
fold switching.

Protein Fitness Prediction Is Impacted by the Interplay of Language Models, 
Ensemble Learning, and Sampling Methods.

Mardikoraem M(1)(2), Woldring D(1)(2).

Advances in machine learning (ML) and the availability of protein sequences via 
high-throughput sequencing techniques have transformed the ability to design 
novel diagnostic and therapeutic proteins. ML allows protein engineers to 
capture complex trends hidden within protein sequences that would otherwise be 
difficult to identify in the context of the immense and rugged protein fitness 
landscape. Despite this potential, there persists a need for guidance during the 
training and evaluation of ML methods over sequencing data. Two key challenges 
for training discriminative models and evaluating their performance include 
handling severely imbalanced datasets (e.g., few high-fitness proteins among an 
abundance of non-functional proteins) and selecting appropriate protein sequence 
representations (numerical encodings). Here, we present a framework for applying 
ML over assay-labeled datasets to elucidate the capacity of sampling techniques 
and protein encoding methods to improve binding affinity and thermal stability 
prediction tasks. For protein sequence representations, we incorporate two 
widely used methods (One-Hot encoding and physiochemical encoding) and two 
language-based methods (next-token prediction, UniRep; masked-token prediction, 
ESM). Elaboration on performance is provided over protein fitness, protein size, 
and sampling techniques. In addition, an ensemble of protein representation 
methods is generated to discover the contribution of distinct representations 
and improve the final prediction score. We then implement multiple criteria 
decision analysis (MCDA; TOPSIS with entropy weighting), using multiple metrics 
well-suited for imbalanced data, to ensure statistical rigor in ranking our 
methods. Within the context of these datasets, the synthetic minority 
oversampling technique (SMOTE) outperformed undersampling while encoding 
sequences with One-Hot, UniRep, and ESM representations. Moreover, ensemble 
learning increased the predictive performance of the affinity-based dataset by 
4% compared to the best single-encoding candidate (F1-score = 97%), while ESM 
alone was rigorous enough in stability prediction (F1-score = 92%).

Micellar Curcumin: Pharmacokinetics and Effects on Inflammation Markers and 
PCSK-9 Concentrations in Healthy Subjects in a Double-Blind, Randomized, 
Active-Controlled, Crossover Trial.

Grafeneder J(1), Derhaschnig U(2), Eskandary F(3), Buchtele N(4), Sus N(5), 
Frank J(5), Jilma B(2), Schoergenhofer C(2).

SCOPE: Preclinical models have demonstrated the anti-inflammatory and 
lipid-lowering effects of curcumin. Innovative formulations have been developed 
to overcome the poor bioavailability of native curcumin. The study hypothesizes 
that the bioavailability of micellar curcumin is superior to native curcumin and 
investigates the potential anti-inflammatory and proprotein convertase 
subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) concentration lowering effects.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In this double-blind, randomized, crossover trial, 15 
healthy volunteers receive micellar or native curcumin (105 mg day-1 ) for 7 
days with a ≥7 days washout period. Curcumin and metabolite concentrations are 
quantified by 
high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FD), 
and pharmacokinetics are calculated. To analyze anti-inflammatory effects, blood 
samples (baseline, 2 h, 7 days) are stimulated with 50 ng mL-1 
lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Interleukin (IL)-6, tumor-necrosis factor (TNF-α), 
and PCSK9 concentrations are quantified. Micellar curcumin demonstrates improved 
bioavailability (≈39-fold higher maximum concentrations, ≈14-fold higher 
area-under-the-time-concentration curve, p < 0.001) but does not reduce 
pro-inflammatory cytokines in the chosen model. Subjects receiving micellar 
curcumin have significantly lower PCSK9 concentrations (≈10% reduction) after 7 
days compared to baseline (p = 0.038).
CONCLUSION: Micellar curcumin demonstrates an improved oral bioavailability but 
does not show anti-inflammatory effects in this model. Potential effects on 
PCSK9 concentrations warrant further investigation.

Impact of Rehydration Following Systemic Dehydration on Vocal Fold Gene 
Expression.

Bailey TW(1), do Nascimento NC(1), Santos AP(2), Cox A(2), Sivasankar MP(1).

OBJECTIVE: Biological data on the beneficial effects of vocal fold rehydration 
are lacking. This study aimed to examine the effects of acute systemic 
dehydration on vocal fold gene expression and determine whether rehydration 
would reverse these changes.
METHODS: Male New Zealand White rabbits (N = 24, n = 8/group) provided the 
animal model. Systemic dehydration was induced by 5 days of water volume 
restriction. Rehydration was provided by ad-lib water for 3 days following 
dehydration. Euhydrated rabbits were used as the control group. Vocal fold 
tissue was dissected. Seventeen genes were selected based on physiological 
function and role in supporting vocal fold structure, oxidative stress, 
hemodynamics, and extracellular matrix turnover. Relative gene expression was 
assessed by RT-qPCR.
RESULTS: Rehydration following systemic dehydration can modulate gene 
expression, with expression patterns suggesting that rehydration reverses 
dehydration-induced changes in over half of the tested genes. CLIC5 (chloride 
intracellular channel 5) and EFEMP1 (EGF containing fibulin extracellular matrix 
protein 1) genes were significantly upregulated in the dehydration group 
compared with the euhydrated control. A1BG (alpha-1B-glycoprotein) and IL1RAP 
(interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein) were downregulated by rehydration 
compared with the dehydration group.
CONCLUSION: This study provides molecular evidence for a transcriptional 
response to rehydration following acute systemic dehydration in the vocal folds. 
These data are the first to study gene expression following realistic 
dehydration and rehydration paradigms and provide biological data to support 
clinical recommendations to increase water intake after acute dehydration.

Podoplanin-positive dilated lymphatic vessels in duodenum associates with 
three-month mortality in patients with cirrhosis.

Juneja P(1), Sharma A(1), Shasthry SM(2), Kumar G(2), Tripathi DM(1), Rajan 
V(2), Rastogi A(3), Sarin SK(2), Kaur S(1).

Dilated and dysfunctional gut lymphatic vessels (LVs) have been reported in 
experimental cirrhosis. Here, we studied LVs in duodenal (D2)-biopsies of liver 
cirrhosis patients and investigated the prognostic role of a LV marker, 
podoplanin (PDPN), in predicting the mortality of patients with cirrhosis. A 
prospective, single-center cohort study was performed in liver cirrhosis 
patients (n = 31) and matched healthy controls (n = 9). D2-biopsies were 
obtained during endoscopy procedure, immunostained with PDPN, and scored based 
on 1) intensity and 2) density of positively-stained LVs per high power field. 
Gut and systemic inflammation were estimated by quantifying duodenal CD3+ 
intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), CD68+ macrophages, and serum TNF-α and IL-6 
levels, respectively. Gut permeability and inflammation as assessed by 
quantifying gene expression of TJP1, OCLN, TNF-α, and IL-6 in D2-biopsies. Gene 
expression of LV markers, PDPN (8-fold), and LYVE1 (3-fold) was enhanced in 
D2-biopsies of cirrhosis patients compared to control (p < 0.0001). The mean 
PDPN score in decompensated cirrhosis patients (6.91 ± 1.26, p < 0.0001) was 
significantly increased as compared to those with compensated (3.25 ± 1.60). 
PDPN score positively and significantly correlated with the number of IELs (r = 
0.33), serum TNF-α (r = 0.35), and IL-6 (r = 0.48) levels, while inversely 
correlated with TJP1 expression (r = -0.46, p < 0.05 each). In Cox regression, 
the PDPN score was a significant and independent 3-month-mortality predictor in 
patients (HR: 5.61; 1.08-29.109; p = 0.04). The area under the curve for the 
PDPN score was 84.2, and cutoff value for predicting mortality was ≥6.5 with 
100% sensitivity and 75% specificity. Collectively, dilated LVs with high PDPN 
expression in D2-biopsies is a characteristic feature of patients with 
decompensated cirrhosis. PDPN score correlates with enhanced gut and systemic 
inflammation and also associates with 3-month mortality in cirrhosis.

Aguilera-Martínez ME(1), Ventura-Martínez R(4), López-Muñoz FJ(5).

OBJECTIVE: The antinociceptive pharmacological interaction between 
N-palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and morphine (MOR), as well as gabapentin (GBP), 
was investigated to obtain synergistic antinociception at doses where side 
effects were minimal. In addition, the possible antinociceptive mechanism of PEA 
+ MOR or PEA + GBP combinations was explored.
METHODS: Individual dose-response curves (DRCs) of PEA, MOR and GBP were 
evaluated in female mice in which intraplantar nociception was induced with 2% 
formalin. Isobolographic method was used to detect the pharmacological 
interaction in the combination of PEA + MOR or PEA + GBP.
KEY FINDINGS: The ED50 was calculated from the DRC; the order of potency was MOR 
> PEA > GBP. The isobolographic analysis was obtained at a 1:1 ratio to 
determine the pharmacological interaction. The experimental values of flinching 
(PEA + MOR, Zexp = 2.72 ± 0.2 μg/paw and PEA + GBP Zexp = 2.77 ± 0.19 μg/paw) 
were significantly lower than those calculated theoretically (PEA + MOR Zadd = 
7.78 ± 1.07 and PEA + GBP Zadd = 24.05 ± 1.91 μg/paw), resulting in synergistic 
antinociception. Pretreatment with GW6471 and naloxone demonstrated that 
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and opioid receptors 
are involved in both interactions.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that MOR and GBP synergistically enhance 
PEA-induced antinociception through PPARα and opioid receptor mechanisms. 
Furthermore, the results suggest that combinations containing PEA with MOR or 
GBP could be of interest in aiding the treatment of inflammatory pain.

Variation in quality of the different prepared formulation granules of rhubarb 
was evaluated by quantitative analysis of multicomponents with single marker.

Fan XL(1), Zhang C(2), Shi YB(3), Xue LB(2), Wei JJ(4).

Rhei Radix et Rhizoma formula granule (RRFG) , Winy Rhei Radix et Rhizoma 
formula granule(WRFG) and Rhubarb charcoal formula granules (RCFG) are the three 
most popular and effective formula granules of rhubarb in China and 
anthraquinone components are their main active ingredients. In order to discuss 
the difference in anthraquinone components of these three drugs, a simultaneous 
quantitative analysis method of multicomponents by single-marker (QAMS) was 
developed. Emodin was chosed as the internal reference standard, the relative 
correction factors (RCFs) of aloe-emodin, rhein, chrysophanol and physcion were 
established and the contents of the four components were calculated based on the 
RCFs, respectively. Meanwhile, the contents of these components was determined 
by external standard method (ESM) and compared with QAMS to verify its 
rationality, feasibility and repeatability. The results showed that there were 
no significant difference between QAMS and ESM (RSDs≤2.26%). The contents of 
anthraquinone components showed a wide variation in these three drugs. All of 5 
components were higher in RRFG than that in the others and RCFG had the lowest 
content. This method was successfully applied for the evaluation on difference 
of these drugs and the wide variation in anthraquinone components indicated 
there were different pharmacodynamic basis.

Diagnostic Value of Sarcopenia Computed Tomography Metrics for Older Patients 
with or without Cancers with Gastrointestinal Disorders.

Zhang Y(1), Zhang T(2), Yin W(1), Zhang L(3), Xiang J(4).

OBJECTIVES: The diagnostic utility of poor body composition measures in 
sarcopenia remains unclear. We hypothesize that the skeletal muscle gauge 
[combination of skeletal muscle index (SMI) and skeletal muscle density (SMD); 
SMG = SMI × SMD] would have significant diagnostic and predictive value in 
certain muscle regions and populations.
DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We examined inpatients age ≥60 years with or without 
cancer and with gastrointestinal disorders.
METHODS: We used computed tomography (CT) image metrics in the 12th thoracic 
(T12), third lumbar (L3), erector spinae muscle (ESM), and psoas muscle (PM) 
regions to establish correlations with the 2019 Asian Working Group for 
Sarcopenia Consensus and used receiver operating characteristic area under the 
curve (AUC) to compare differences between metrics. Associations between CT 
metrics and mortality were reported as relative risk after adjustments.
RESULTS: We evaluated 385 patients (median age, 69.0 years; 60.8% men) and found 
consistent trends in cancer (49.6%) and noncancer (50.4%) cohorts. SMG had a 
stronger correlation with muscle mass than SMD [mean rho: 0.68 (range, 
0.59‒0.73) vs 0.39 (range, 0.28‒0.48); all P < .01] in T12, L3, and PM regions 
and a stronger correlation with muscle function than SMI [mean rho: 0.60 (range, 
0.50‒0.77) vs 0.36 (range, 0.22‒0.58); all P < .05] in T12, ESM, and L3 regions. 
SMG outperformed SMI in diagnostic accuracy in all regions, particularly for L3 
(AUC: 0.87‒0.88 vs 0.80‒0.82; both P < .05). PMG (PM gauge) and L3SMG did not 
differ, whereas EMG (ESM gauge) or T12SMG and L3SMG did (AUC: 0.80‒0.82 vs 
0.87‒0.88; all P < .05). L3SMI, L3SMD, T12SMG, EMG, and PMG showed no 
association with 1-year cancer-related mortality after adjusting for 
confounders; however, L3SMG [relative risk = 0.92 (0.85‒0.99); P = .023) was.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: L3SMG covers all features of sarcopenia with more 
diagnostic value than other metrics, allowing a complete sarcopenia assessment 
with CT alone and not just in populations with cancer.

A High-Specific-Activity L-aspartate-α-Decarboxylase from Bacillus aryabhattai 
Gel-09 and Site-Directed Mutation to Improve Its Substrate Tolerance.

Ding Q(1), Duan X(2).

L-aspartate-α-decarboxylase (ADC) can recognize L-aspartic acid specifically and 
catalyze the decarboxylation of L-aspartic acid to β-alanine. In this study, a 
novel L-aspartate-α-decarboxylase (BaADC) with high specific activity from 
Bacillus aryabhattai Gel-09 was heterologously expressed and characterized. It 
exhibited optimal enzyme activity at pH 5.5 and 75 °C, and its specific activity 
was 33.9 U/mg. To improve the substrate tolerance of BaADC, site-directed 
mutation was used to construct variants. The optimal variant BaADC_I88M 
exhibited higher pH stability and thermostability, with 1.2-fold increase in 
catalytic efficiency. Moreover, through the fed-batch method, the conversion of 
L-aspartic acid to β-alanine catalyzed by BaADC_I88M reached 98.6% (128.67 g/L) 
at 12 h, which was 1.42-fold that of the wild-type enzyme. The mechanism of 
improved substrate tolerance was interpreted by molecular dynamics simulation 
and structural analysis, which revealed that the local conformational change in 
the active pocket could promote correct protonation. These results suggested 
that BaADC and its variant are potential candidates for use in the industrial 
production of β-alanine.

Evaluation of Endocan as a Treatment for Acute Inflammatory Respiratory Failure.

Hureau M(1), Portier L(2), Prin M(3), de Nadai P(4), Balsamelli J(4), 
Tsicopoulos A(5), Mathieu D(6), Lassalle P(2), Grigoriu B(7), Gaudet A(6), De 
Freitas Caires N(2).

BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening 
condition resulting from acute pulmonary inflammation. However, no specific 
treatment for ARDS has yet been developed. Previous findings suggest that lung 
injuries related to ARDS could be regulated by endocan (Esm-1). The aim of this 
study was to evaluate the potential efficiency of endocan in the treatment of 
ARDS.
METHODS: We first compared the features of acute pulmonary inflammation and the 
severity of hypoxemia in a tracheal LPS-induced acute lung injury (ALI) model 
performed in knockout (Esm1-/-) and wild type (WT) littermate C57Bl/6 mice. 
Next, we assessed the effects of a continuous infusion of glycosylated murine 
endocan in our ALI model in Esm1-/- mice.
RESULTS: In our ALI model, we report higher alveolar leukocytes (p < 0.001), 
neutrophils (p < 0.001), and MPO (p < 0.001), and lower blood oxygenation (p < 
0.001) in Esm1-/- mice compared to WT mice. Continuous delivery of glycosylated 
murine endocan after LPS-induced ALI resulted in decreased alveolar leukocytes 
(p = 0.012) and neutrophils (p = 0.012), higher blood oxygenation levels (p < 
0.001), and reduced histological lung injury (p = 0.04), compared to mice 
treated with PBS.
CONCLUSIONS: Endocan appears to be an effective treatment in an ARDS-like model 
in C57Bl/6 mice.

Probiotic Bacillus licheniformis MCC2514 and Bifidobacterium breve NCIM 5671 
Regulates GATA3 and Foxp3 Expression in the Elevated Disease Condition.

Rohith HS(1), Peddha MS(2), Halami PM(3).

TNBS-induced ulcerative colitis was evaluated using Bacillus licheniformis MCC 
2514 (B. licheniformis) and Bifidobacterium breve NCIM 5671 (Bf. breve) as 
immune modulators. The study aims to analyze probiotic efficiency of ulcerative 
colitis induced by TNBS in Wistar rats. The tumor-like structure was found in 
the colon of TNBS inflammation-induced rats. Nitric oxide production was 
inhibited by about 65.2% fed with combination of bacteria and C-reactive 
protein, and decreased by 12% and 10.8% upon supplementing B. 
licheniformis and Bf. breve against the TNBS-treated rats, respectively. Liver 
damage was observed in the TNBS-treated rats; addition of probiotic bacteria 
reduced SGPT (75.4%) and SGOT (42.5%). On TNBS treatment, the transcriptional 
factor responsible for Th2 cell immune response (GATA3) was analyzed, and the 
elevation in gene expression (5.31-fold) was found. The FOXP-3 responsible for 
T-regulatory cells was expressed about 0.91-fold upon the treatment with a 
combination of bacteria. The expression of antioxidant genes such as iNOS 
(1.11-fold), GPx (1.29-fold), and PON1 (1.48-fold) has been increased when 
compared with that of the TNBS-treated group. The cytokines specific to 
Th2-driven immune response, such as IL-4, IL-5, and TNF-α, were reduced upon 
feeding the bacteria. It is observed that the B. licheniformis and Bf. 
breve used in the study have reduced Th2-driven immune response.

Resveratrol Blunts Mitochondrial Loss in Slow and Mixed Skeletal Muscle 
Phenotypes of Non-Human Primates following a Long-Term High Fat/Sugar Diet.

Hyatt JK(1), de Cabo R(2), Mattison JA(2).

Mitochondrial biogenesis and destruction in skeletal muscle are coordinated by 
distinct signaling pathways that are influenced by internal and exogenous 
variables including, but not limited to, muscle phenotype, physical activity, 
dietary composition, or drug administration. Previously we found that long-term 
resveratrol administration (up to 480 mg/day) ameliorates the slow-to-fast 
phenotypic shift in soleus muscles and promotes the expression in slow myosin 
heavy chain in the mixed plantaris muscle of non-human primates consuming a high 
fat/sugar (HFS) diet. Here, we expand on these earlier findings by examining 
whether mitochondrial content and the markers that dictate their biogenesis and 
mitophagy/autophagy are similarly affected by HFS and/or influenced by 
resveratrol while consuming this diet (HFSR). Compared to controls (n = 9), 
there was a ∼20-25% decrease in mitochondrial content in HFS (n = 8) muscles as 
reflected in the COX2- and CYTB-to-GAPDH ratios using PCR analysis, which was 
blunted by resveratrol in HFSR (n = 7) soleus and, to a lesser degree, in 
plantaris muscles. A ∼1.5 and 3-fold increase in Rev-erb-α protein was detected 
in HFSR soleus and plantaris muscles compared to controls, respectively. Unlike 
in HFSR animals, HFS soleus and plantaris muscles exhibited a ∼2-fold elevation 
in phosphor-AMPKα (Thr172). HFS soleus muscles had elevated 
phosphorylated-to-total TANK binding protein-1 (TBK1) ratio suggesting an 
enhancement in mito/autophagic events. Taken together, resveratrol appears to 
blunt mitochondrial losses with a high fat/sugar diet by tempering 
mito/autophagy rather than promoting mitochondrial biogenesis, suggesting that 
the quantity of daily resveratrol supplement ingested and/or its long-term 
consumption are important considerations.Supplemental data for this article is

Mapping the network biology of metabolic response to stress in posttraumatic 
stress disorder and obesity.

Chacko TP(1)(2), Toole JT(1)(2), Richman S(1), Spink GL Jr(3), Reinhard MJ(4), 
Brewster RC(4), Costanzo ME(4), Broderick G(1).

The co-occurrence of stress-induced posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and 
obesity is common, particularly among military personnel but the link between 
these conditions is unclear. Individuals with comorbid PTSD and obesity manifest 
other physical and psychological problems, which significantly diminish their 
quality of life. Current understanding of the pathways connecting stress to PTSD 
and obesity is focused largely on behavioral mediators alone with little 
consideration of the biological regulatory mechanisms that underlie their 
co-occurrence. In this work, we leverage prior knowledge to systematically 
highlight such bio-behavioral mechanisms and inform on the design of 
confirmatory pilot studies. We use natural language processing (NLP) to extract 
documented regulatory interactions involved in the metabolic response to stress 
and its impact on obesity and PTSD from over 8 million peer-reviewed papers. The 
resulting network describes the propagation of stress to PTSD and obesity 
through 34 metabolic mediators using 302 documented regulatory interactions 
supported by over 10,000 citations. Stress jointly affected both conditions 
through 21 distinct pathways involving only two intermediate metabolic mediators 
out of a total of 76 available paths through this network. Moreover, oxytocin 
(OXT), Neuropeptide-Y (NPY), and cortisol supported an almost direct propagation 
of stress to PTSD and obesity with different net effects. Although stress 
upregulated both NPY and cortisol, the downstream effects of both markers are 
reported to relieve PTSD severity but exacerbate obesity. The stress-mediated 
release of oxytocin, however, was found to concurrently downregulate the 
severity of both conditions. These findings highlight how a network-informed 
approach that leverages prior knowledge might be used effectively in identifying 
key mediators like OXT though experimental verification of signal transmission 
dynamics through each path will be needed to determine the actual likelihood and 
extent of each marker's participation.

A Case Report on Longitudinal Collection of Tumour Biopsies for Gene 
Expression-Based Tumour Microenvironment Analysis from Pancreatic Cancer 
Patients Treated with Endoscopic Ultrasound Guided Radiofrequency Ablation.

Lawrence PV(1), Desai K(1), Wadsworth C(2), Mangal N(1)(2), Kocher HM(3)(4)(5), 
Habib N(2), Sadanandam A(1)(6), Sodergren MH(2).

BACKGROUND: Most patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are 
metastatic at presentation with dismal prognosis warranting improved systemic 
therapy options. Longitudinal sampling for the assessment of treatment response 
poses a challenge for validating novel therapies. In this case study, we 
evaluate the feasibility of collecting endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided 
longitudinal fine-needle aspiration biopsies (FNABs) from two PDAC patients and 
conduct gene expression studies associated with tumour microenvironment changes 
associated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA).
METHODS: EUS-guided serial/longitudinal FNABs of tumour were collected before 
and after treatment from two stage III inoperable gemcitabine-treated PDAC 
patients treated with targeted RFA three times. Biopsies were analysed using a 
custom NanoString panel (144 genes) consisting of cancer and cancer-associated 
fibroblast (CAFs) subtypes and immune changes. CAF culture was established from 
one FNAB and characterised by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting.
RESULTS: Two-course RFA led to the upregulation of the CD1E gene (involved in 
antigen presentation) in both patients 1 and 2 (4.5 and 3.9-fold changes) 
compared to baseline. Patient 1 showed increased T cell genes (CD4-8.7-fold 
change, CD8-35.7-fold change), cytolytic function (6.4-fold change) and 
inflammatory response (8-fold change). A greater than 2-fold upregulation of 
immune checkpoint genes was observed post-second RFA in both patients. Further, 
two-course RFA led to increased PDGFRα (4.5-fold change) and CAF subtypes B and 
C genes in patient 1 and subtypes A, B and D genes in patient 2. Patient 
2-derived CAFs post-first RFA showed expression of PDGFRα, POSTN and MYH11 
proteins. Finally, RFA led to the downregulation of classical PDAC 
subtype-specific genes in both patients.
CONCLUSIONS: This case study suggests longitudinal EUS-FNAB as a potential 
resource to study tumour and microenvironmental changes associated with RFA 
treatment. A large sample size is required in the future to assess the efficacy 
and safety of the treatment and perform comprehensive statistical analysis of 
EUS-RFA-based molecular changes in PDAC.

Analyses of adult transcriptomes from four different populations of the spongy 
moth, Lymantria dispar L., from China and the USA.

Wang YM(1), Sparks ME(2), Harrison RL(2), Shi J(3).

The spongy moth Lymantria dispar, formerly known as the gypsy moth, is a forest 
pest that occurs as two different biotypes: the European spongy moth (ESM), 
Lymantria dispar dispar, which is distributed in Europe and North America; and 
the Asian spongy moth (ASM), which consists of subspecies Lymantria dispar 
asiatica and Lymantria dispar japonica and is distributed in China, Russia, 
Korea, and Japan. The Asian biotype is classified as a quarantine pest by the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture because of the superior flight ability of adult 
females compared to females of the European biotype. To identify genes that 
potentially account for differences in female flight capability between the two 
biotypes, we assembled and compared transcriptional profiles of two North 
American populations of ESM and two Chinese populations of ASM, including 
samples of unmated female adults and females after mating and oviposition. Of 
129,286 unigenes identified, 306 were up-regulated in ASM samples relative to 
ESM, including genes involved in egg production. In contrast, 2309 unigenes were 
down-regulated in ASM samples, including genes involved in energy production. 
Although a previous study found that ASM female flight was reduced after 
oviposition, a comparison of gene expression before and after mating and 
oviposition did not reveal any genes which were consistently up- or 
down-regulated in the two ASM populations.

Production of food-grade microcarriers based on by-products from the food 
industry to facilitate the expansion of bovine skeletal muscle satellite cells 
for cultured meat production.

Andreassen RC(1), Rønning SB(1), Solberg NT(1), Grønlien KG(2), Kristoffersen 
KA(1), Høst V(1), Kolset SO(3), Pedersen ME(4).

A major challenge for successful cultured meat production is the requirement for 
large quantities of skeletal muscle satellite cells (MuSCs). Commercial 
microcarriers (MCs), such as Cytodex®1, enable extensive cell expansion by 
offering a large surface-to-volume ratio. However, the cell-dissociation step 
post cell expansion makes the cell expansion less efficient. A solution is using 
food-grade MCs made of sustainable raw materials that do not require a 
dissociation step and can be included in the final meat product. This study 
aimed to produce food-grade MCs from food industry by-products (i.e., turkey 
collagen and eggshell membrane) and testing their ability to expand bovine MuSCs 
in spinner flask systems for eight days. The MCs' physical properties were 
characterized, followed by analyzing the cell adhesion, growth, and metabolic 
activity. All MCs had an interconnected porous structure. Hybrid MCs composed of 
eggshell membrane and collagen increased the mechanical hardness and stabilized 
the buoyancy compared to pure collagen MCs. The MuSCs successively attached and 
covered the entire surface of all MCs while expressing high cell proliferation, 
metabolic activity, and low cell cytotoxicity. Cytodex®1 MCs were included in 
the study. Relative gene expression of skeletal muscle markers showed reduced 
PAX7 and increased MYF5, which together with augmented proliferation marker 
MKI67 indicated activated and proliferating MuSCs on all MCs. Furthermore, the 
expression pattern of cell adhesion receptors (ITGb5 and SDC4) and focal 
adhesion marker VCL varied between the distinct MCs, indicating different 
specific cell receptor interactions with the various biomaterials. Altogether, 
our results demonstrate that these biomaterials are promising prospects to 
produce custom-fabricated food-grade MCs intended to expand MuSCs.

Failure to decrease HbA1c levels following TB treatment is associated with 
elevated Th1/Th17 CD4+ responses.

INTRODUCTION: The rising global burden of metabolic disease impacts the control 
of endemic tuberculosis (TB) in many regions, as persons with diabetes mellitus 
(DM) are up to three times more likely to develop active TB than those without 
DM. Active TB can also promote glucose intolerance during both acute infection 
and over a longer term, potentially driven by aspects of the immune response. 
Identifying patients likely to have persistent hyperglycemia following TB 
treatment would enable closer monitoring and care, and an improved understanding 
of underlying immunometabolic dysregulation.
METHODS: We measured the relationship of plasma cytokine levels, T cell 
phenotypes and functional responses with the change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) 
before and after treatment of pulmonary TB in a prospective observational cohort 
in Durban, South Africa. Participants were stratified based on stable/increased 
HbA1c (n = 16) versus decreased HbA1c (n = 46) levels from treatment initiation 
to 12 month follow-up.
RESULTS: CD62 P-selectin was up- (1.5-fold) and IL-10 downregulated (0.85-fold) 
in plasma among individuals whose HbA1c remained stable/increased during TB 
treatment. This was accompanied by increased pro-inflammatory TB-specific IL-17 
production (Th17). In addition, Th1 responses were upregulated in this group, 
including TNF-α production and CX3CR1 expression, with decreased IL-4 and IL-13 
production. Finally, the TNF-α+ IFNγ+ CD8+ T cells were associated with 
stable/increased HbA1c. These changes were all significantly different in the 
stable/increased HbA1c relative to the decreased HbA1c group.
DISCUSSION: Overall, these data suggest that patients with stable/increased 
HbA1c had an increased pro-inflammatory state. Persistent inflammation and 
elevated T cell activity in individuals with unresolved dysglycemia following TB 
treatment may indicate failure to fully resolve infection or may promote 
persistent dysglycemia in these individuals, and further studies are needed to 
explore potential mechanisms.

Aging of α-Pinene Secondary Organic Aerosol by Hydroxyl Radicals in the Aqueous 
Phase: Kinetics and Products.

Witkowski B(1), Al-Sharafi M(1), Błaziak K(1), Gierczak T(1).

The reaction of hydroxyl radicals (OH) with a water-soluble fraction of the 
α-pinene secondary organic aerosol (SOA) was investigated using liquid 
chromatography coupled with negative electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. 
The SOA was generated by the dark ozonolysis of α-pinene, extracted into the 
water, and subjected to chemical aging by the OH. Bimolecular reaction rate 
coefficients (kOH) for the oxidation of terpenoic acids by the OH were measured 
using the relative rate method. The unaged SOA was dominated by the 
cyclobutyl-ring-retaining compounds, primarily cis-pinonic, cis-pinic, and 
hydroxy-pinonic acids. Aqueous oxidation by the OH resulted in the removal of 
early-stage products and dimers, including well-known oligomers with MW = 358 
and 368 Da. Furthermore, a 2- to 5-fold increase in the concentration of 
cyclobutyl-ring-opening products was observed, including terpenylic and 
diaterpenylic acids and diaterpenylic acid acetate as well as some of the newly 
identified OH aging markers. At the same time, results obtained from the kinetic 
box model showed a high degree of SOA fragmentation following the reaction with 
the OH, which indicates that non-radical reactions occurring during the 
evaporation of water likely contribute to the high yields of terpenoic aqSOAs 
reported previously. The estimated atmospheric lifetimes showed that in clouds, 
terpenoic acids react with the OH exclusively in the aqueous phase. Aqueous OH 
aging of the α-pinene SOA results in a 10% increase of the average O/C ratio and 
a 3-fold decrease in the average kOH value, which is likely to affect the cloud 
condensation nuclei activity of the aqSOA formed after the evaporation of water.

Anti-Fibrotic Efficacy of Apigenin in a Mice Model of Carbon 
Tetrachloride-Induced Hepatic Fibrosis by Modulation of Oxidative Stress, 
Inflammation, and Fibrogenesis: A Preclinical Study.

Melaibari M(1), Alkreathy HM(1), Esmat A(1)(2), Rajeh NA(3), Shaik RA(4), 
Alghamdi AA(5)(6), Ahmad A(5)(6).

BACKGROUND: Hepatic fibrosis is a major health problem all over the world, and 
there is no effective treatment to cure it. Hence, the current study sought to 
assess the anti-fibrotic efficacy of apigenin against CCl4-induced hepatic 
fibrosis in mice.
METHODS: Forty-eight mice were put into six groups. G1: Normal Control, G2: CCl4 
Control, G3: Silymarin (100 mg/kg), G4 and G5: Apigenin (2 &20 mg/Kg), G6: 
Apigenin alone (20 mg/Kg). Groups 2, 3, 4, and 5 were given CCl4 (0.5 mL/kg. 
i.p.) twice/week for six weeks. The level of AST, ALT, TC, TG, and TB in serum 
and IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in tissue homogenates were assessed. Histological 
studies by H&E staining and Immunostaining of liver tissues were also performed.
RESULTS: The CCl4-challenged group showed increased serum AST (4-fold), ALT 
(6-fold), and TB (5-fold). Both silymarin and apigenin treatments significantly 
improved these hepatic biomarkers. The CCl4-challenged group showed reduced 
levels of CAT (89%), GSH (53%), and increased MDA (3-fold). Both silymarin and 
apigenin treatments significantly altered these oxidative markers in tissue 
homogenates. The CCl4-treated group showed a two-fold increase in IL-1β, IL-6, 
and TNF-α levels. Silymarin and apigenin treatment considerably decreased the 
IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α levels. Apigenin treatment inhibited angiogenic activity, 
as evidenced by a decrease in VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) 
expression in liver tissues, and a decline in vascular endothelial cell antigen 
expression (CD34).
CONCLUSIONS: Finally, these data collectively imply that apigenin may have 
antifibrotic properties, which may be explained by its anti-inflammatory, 
antioxidant, and antiangiogenic activities.

A ketamine package for use in emergency cesarean delivery when no anesthetist is 
available: An analysis of 401 consecutive operations.

Burke TF(1)(2)(3), Mantena S(4), Opondo K(1)(5), Orero S(5)(6), Rogo K(5)(6).

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a ketamine-based 
anesthesia package to support emergency cesarean section when no anesthetist is 
available.
METHODS: A prospective case-series was conducted between December 11, 2013 and 
September 30, 2021 across nine sub-county hospitals in Kenya. Non-anesthetist 
healthcare providers undertook an evidence-based five-day training course. A 
structured instrument was used to collect preoperative, intraoperative, and 
postoperative data, and patients were contacted 6 months following the surgery 
to collect outcomes. The primary outcome measures were maternal and newborn 
survival and the ability of the ketamine package (ESM-Ketamine) to safely 
support cesarean deliveries.
RESULTS: A total of 401 emergency cesarean sections were performed using 
ketamine, administered by 54 non-anesthetist providers. All mothers survived to 
discharge. Brief oxygen desaturations were recorded among 33 (8.2%) mothers, and 
agitation and hallucinations occurred among 13 (3.2%). There were no maternal 
serious adverse events. At 6-month follow-up, 94.2% of mothers who could be 
reached reported no complaints. Additionally, 402 (92.4%) of the 435 operative 
births survived to discharge.
CONCLUSION: The ESM-Ketamine package can be used by trained non-anesthetist 
providers to support emergency cesarean sections when no anesthetist is 
available. Ketamine has significant potential to increase access to emergency 
cesarean deliveries in resource-limited settings.

Human Hepatocyte Nuclear Factors (HNF1 and LXRb) Regulate CYP7A1 in HIV-Infected 
Black South African Women with Gallstone Disease: A Preliminary Study.

Kinoo SM(1)(2), Naidoo P(1), Singh B(2), Chuturgoon A(1), Nagiah S(1)(3).

Female sex, high estrogen levels, aging, obesity, and dyslipidemia are some of 
the risk factors associated with gallstone formation. HIV-infected patients on 
combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) are more prone to 
hypercholesterolemia. Bile acid synthesis is initiated by cholesterol 7-alpha 
hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and regulated by hepatocyte nuclear factors (HNF1α, HNF4α, 
and LXRb). The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of HNF1α, HNF4α, 
LXRb, and miRNAs (HNF4α specific: miR-194-5p and miR-122*_1) that regulate 
CYP7A1 transcription in HIV-infected Black South African women on cART and 
presenting with gallstones relative to HIV-negative patients with gallstone 
disease. Females (n = 96) presenting with gallstone disease were stratified 
based on HIV status. The gene expression of CYP7A1, HNF1α, HNF4α, LXRb, 
miR-194-5p, and miR-122*_1 was determined using RT-qPCR. Messenger RNA and miRNA 
levels were reported as fold change expressed as 2-ΔΔCt (RQ min; RQ max). Fold 
changes >2 and <0.5 were considered significant. HIV-infected females were older 
in age (p = 0.0267) and displayed higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(LDL-c) (p = 0.0419), CYP7A1 [2.078-fold (RQ min: 1.278; RQ max: 3.381)], LXRb 
[2.595-fold (RQ min: 2.001; RQ max: 3.000)], and HNF1α [3.428 (RQ min: 1.806; RQ 
max: 6.507] levels. HNF4α [0.642-fold (RQ min: 0.266; RQ max: 1.55)], miR-194-5p 
[0.527-fold (RQ min: 0.37; RQ max: 0.752)], and miR-122*_1 [0.595-fold (RQ min: 
0.332; RQ max: 1.066)] levels were lower in HIV-infected females. In conclusion, 
HIV-infected women with gallstone disease displayed higher LDL-c levels and 
increased bile acid synthesis, which was evidenced by the elevated expression of 
CYP7A1, HNF1α, and LXRb. This could have been further influenced by cART and 
aging.

Tracking perceived stress, anxiety, and depression in daily life: a 
double-downward spiral process.

Feng G(1)(2), Xu X(1), Lei J(1).

INTRODUCTION: Previous studies using retrospective questionnaires have suggested 
a complex relationship between perceived stress and related negative emotions 
and emphasized their importance in mental health. However, how daily perceived 
stress, anxiety, and depression interact dynamically in a natural context 
remains largely unexplored.
METHODS: This study conducted a longitudinal survey that applied experience 
sampling methodology to data from 141 Chinese college students (58% women, mean 
age = 20.1 ± 1.63 years).
RESULTS: The hierarchical linear models confirmed that daily perceived stress 
and negative emotions (i.e., perceived depression and anxiety) could 
reciprocally reinforce one another with the characteristic dynamics of a 
cognitive-emotional downward spiral. Additionally, anxiety and depression could 
further circularly aggravate each other imminently. These two intertwined 
downward-spiral processes constitute a double-downward-spiral model.
DISCUSSION: The findings contribute to a better understanding of the interactive 
mechanisms underlying perceived stress and its related negative emotions in 
everyday life and highlight the significance of early emotion regulation and 
stress relief in healthy people.

The DizzyQuest: relation between self-reported hearing loss, tinnitus and 
objective hearing thresholds in patients with Meniere's disease.

Weijer SCF(5), Blom H(6), Zwergal A(7), Grill E(8), Guinand N(9), Perez-Fornos 
A(9), Tse D(#)(10), van de Berg R(#)(11)(12).

BACKGROUND: Combining a mobile application-based vestibular diary called the 
DizzyQuest and an iPad-based hearing test enables evaluation of the relationship 
between experienced neuro-otological symptoms and hearing thresholds in daily 
life setting. The aim was to investigate the relationship between self-reported 
hearing symptoms and hearing thresholds in patients with Meniere's disease (MD), 
using the DizzyQuest and the iPad-based hearing test simultaneously.
METHODS: The DizzyQuest was administered for 3 weeks in 21 patients. Using the 
experience-sampling-method (ESM), it assessed hearing loss and tinnitus severity 
for both ears separately. Each day after the DizzyQuest, an iPad-based hearing 
test was used to measure hearing thresholds. A mixed model regression analysis 
was performed to investigate relationships between hearing thresholds and 
self-reported hearing loss and tinnitus severity.
RESULTS: Fifteen patients were included. Overall, pure-tone averages (PTAs) were 
not correlated with self-reported hearing loss severity and tinnitus. Individual 
differences in PTA results between both ears did not significantly influence the 
difference in self-reported hearing loss severity between both ears. 
Self-reported hearing loss and tinnitus scores were significantly higher in ears 
that corresponded with audiometric criteria of MD (p < 0.001). Self-reported 
tinnitus severity significantly increased with self-reported hearing loss 
severity in affected (p = 0.011) and unaffected ears (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Combining the DizzyQuest and iPad-based hearing test, facilitated 
assessment of self-reported hearing loss and tinnitus severity and their 
relationship with hearing thresholds, in a daily life setting. This study 
illustrated the importance of investigating neuro-otological symptoms at an 
individual level, using multiple measurements. ESM strategies like the 
DizzyQuest should therefore be considered in neuro-otological research.

Stimulation of glucose uptake by glycosides from Alectra parasitica subsp. 
chitrakutensis (M.A. Rau) K.K. Khanna & An. Kumar: An in-vitro study of TNF-α 
induced insulin resistance in L6 myoblasts.

Ranjana(1), Binwal M(2), Verma AK(3), Bawankule DU(2), Tiwari N(1), Shanker 
K(1).

Alectra parasitica subsp. chitrakutensis (M.A. Rau) K.K. Khanna & An. Kumar 
(Orobanchaceae) is a parasitic plant indigenous to India. Locally, the plant is 
known as 'Midaki and Nirgundikand'. It is used to treat fever, piles, 
cardiovascular disorders, and blood-borne non-infectious diseases by ethnic 
communities. The phytochemical investigation of A. parasitica subsp. 
chitrakutensis rhizome led to the isolation of azafrin (1), rehmaionoside-C (2), 
and mussaenoside (3). Compounds (2) and (3) are being reported for the first 
time from this plant. Compounds were evaluated for their intercellular glucose 
uptake activity in basal and insulin-TNF-α-stimulated L6 muscle cells. In 
particular, rehmaionoside C exhibited activity comparative to metformin, 
increasing uptake by basal- and insulin-TNF-α-stimulated cells by 4.88- and 
3.90-fold and 5.04- and 4.04-fold. While azafrin and mussaenoside have produced 
3.03- and 2.36-fold; 4.03- and 3.22-fold increase in intercellular glucose 
uptake. Compounds did not show toxicities in rat L6 myoblast cells. The study 
suggests that rehmaionoside-C from A. parasitica subsp. chitrakutensis might 
activate glucose uptake by insulin mimics and could be a nontoxic anti-diabetes 
lead for drug discovery.

Serum E-selectin and endothelial cell-specific Molecule-1 levels among people 
living with HIV on long term ART in Uganda: a pilot cross-sectional study.

Semulimi AW(1), Batte C(2), Bayiyana A(3), Nakabuye M(2), Mukisa J(3), 
Castelnuovo B(4), Ratanshi RP(4)(5), Kirenga BJ(2)(6), Ssinabulya I(6).

BACKGROUND: Prolonged exposure to HIV and anti-retroviral therapy (ART) has been 
linked with endothelial cell activation which subsequently predisposes people 
living with HIV (PLWH) to cardiovascular diseases. Serum biomarkers of 
endothelial cell activation such as E-Selectin and endothelial cell-specific 
molecule-1 (ESM-1) could aid in early detection of PLWH at a risk of 
cardiovascular diseases. However, there is a paucity of data on these biomarkers 
like E-selectin and endothelial cell-specific molecule-1 (ESM-1) among PLWH on 
long term ART (≥ 10 years) in Uganda. The aim of this study is to determine the 
serum levels of these biomarkers in this population.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study where we randomly sampled 73 stored 
serum samples of PLWH who were enrolled in the Infectious Diseases Institute 
(IDI) ART long term (ALT cohort). We measured serum levels of E-selectin and 
ESM-1 by ELISA. Data was summarized using median and interquartile range. 
Inferential statistics were performed to determine predictors of elevated levels 
of E-selectin.
RESULTS: Of the 73 samples analyzed, 38 (52.1%) were from female participants. 
The mean age was 54 ± 9.0 years. Twenty participants (27.4%) had a history of 
smoking while 52 (71.2%) had a history of alcohol intake. Twenty-five (34.3%) of 
the participants were overweight whereas 4 (5.6%) were obese. Fifty-four (74%) 
had an undetectable viral load (≤ 0 copies/ml) and the mean duration of ART at 
the time of sampling (2014/2015) was 10.4 ± 0.4 years. While serum levels of 
ESM-1 were not detectable in any of our samples, the median E-selectin levels 
was 147.6 μm/L ranging from 8.44 μm/L and 1,979.36 μm/L. Sixty-seven 
participants (91.8%) had elevated levels of E-selectin (> 39 μm/L). CD4 
count > 500 cells/µl compared to lower counts was a predictor of elevated levels 
of E-Selectin (adjusted Odd Ratio 12.5, 95% CI (1.03 - 149.95, p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The majority (91.8%) of PLWH on long term ART had elevated levels 
of E-selectin. Having high CD4 count (> 500 cells/µl) was predictive of elevated 
levels of E-Selectin. Future work should longitudinally assess the trend of 
levels of E-selectin and ESM-1 while assessing for cardiovascular diseases 
endpoint.

Efficacy of TurmiZn, a Metallic Complex of Curcuminoids-Tetrahydrocurcumin and 
Zinc on Bioavailability, Antioxidant, and Cytokine Modulation Capability.

DuBourdieu D(1), Talukder J(1), Srivastava A(1), Lall R(1), Panchal S(2), 
Kothari C(2), Gupta RC(3).

Complexes of curcumin with metals have shown much-improved stability, 
solubility, antioxidant capability, and efficacy when compared to curcumin. The 
present research investigates the relative bioavailability, antioxidant, and 
ability to inhibit inflammatory cytokine production of a curcuminoid metal 
chelation complex of tetrahydrocurcumin-zinc-curcuminoid termed TurmiZn. In 
vitro uptake assay using pig intestinal epithelial cells showed that TurmiZn has 
an ~3-fold increase (p ≤ 0.01) in uptake compared to curcumin and a ~2-fold 
increase (p ≤ 0.01) over tetrahydrocurcumin (THC). In a chicken model, an oral 
1-g dose of TurmiZn showed a ~2.5-fold increase of a specific metabolite peak 
compared to curcumin (p = 0.004) and a ~3-fold increase compared to THC (p = 
0.001). Oral doses (5 g/Kg) of TurmiZn in rats also showed the presence of 
curcumin and THC metabolites in plasma, indicating bioavailability across cell 
membranes in animals. Determination of the antioxidant activity by a 
2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate (DPPH) radical scavenging assay indicated 
that TurmiZn was about 13x better (p ≤ 0.0001) than curcumin and about 4X better 
(p ≤ 0.0001) than THC, in reducing free radicals. In vitro experiments further 
showed significant (p ≤ 0.01) reductions of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced 
proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL) IL-6, IL-8, IL-15, IL-18, and 
tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, while showing a significant (p ≤ 0.01) 
increase of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in dog 
kidney cells. In vivo cytokine modulations were also observed when TurmiZn was 
fed for 6 weeks to newborn chickens. TurmiZn reduced IL-1 and IL-6, but 
significantly reduced (p ≤ 0.01) IL-10 levels while there was a concurrent 
significant (p = 0.02) increase in interferon gamma compared to controls. 
Overall, these results indicate that TurmiZn has better bioavailability and 
antioxidant capability than curcumin or THC and has the ability to significantly 
modulate cytokine levels. Thus, TurmiZn could be an excellent candidate for a 
novel ingredient that can be incorporated into food and supplements to help 
overall health during the aging process.

Tendon and ligament injuries are frequent in sport horses and humans, and such 
injuries represent a significant therapeutic challenge. Tissue regeneration and 
function recovery are the paramount goals of tendon and ligament lesion 
management. Nowadays, several regenerative treatments are being developed, based 
on the use of stem cell and stem cell-based therapies. In the present study, the 
preparation of equine synovial membrane mesenchymal stem cells (eSM-MSCs) is 
described for clinical use, collection, transport, isolation, differentiation, 
characterization, and application. These cells are fibroblast-like and grow in 
clusters. They retain osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic differentiation 
potential. We present 16 clinical cases of tendonitis and desmitis, treated with 
allogenic eSM-MSCs and autologous serum, and we also include their evaluation, 
treatment, and follow-up. The concerns associated with the use of autologous 
serum as a vehicle are related to a reduced immunogenic response after the 
administration of this therapeutic combination, as well as the pro-regenerative 
effects from the growth factors and immunoglobulins that are part of its 
constitution. Most of the cases (14/16) healed in 30 days and presented good 
outcomes. Treatment of tendon and ligament lesions with a mixture of eSM-MSCs 
and autologous serum appears to be a promising clinical option for this category 
of lesions in equine patients.

BOLD fMRI and DTI fiber tracking for preoperative mapping of eloquent cerebral 
regions in brain tumor patients: impact on surgical approach and outcome.

Lolli VE(#)(1), Coolen T(#)(2), Sadeghi N(2), Voordecker P(3), Lefranc F(4).

PURPOSE: Task-based BOLD fMRI and DTI-fiber tracking have become part of the 
routine presurgical work-up of brain tumor patients in many institutions. 
However, their potential impact on both surgical treatment and neurologic 
outcome remains unclear, in despite of the high costs and complex 
implementation.
METHODS: We retrospectively investigated whether performing fMRI and DTI-ft 
preoperatively substantially impacted surgical planning and patient outcome in a 
series of brain tumor patients. We assessed (i) the quality of fMRI and DTI-ft 
results, by using a scale of 0-2 (0 = failed mapping; 1 = intermediate 
confidence; 2 = good confidence), (ii) whether functional planning substantially 
contributed to defining the surgical strategy to be undertaken (i.e., no 
surgery, biopsy, or resection, with or without ESM), the surgical entry point 
and extent of resection, and (iii) the incidence of neurological deficits 
post-operatively.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients constituted the study population. The mean 
confidence rating was 1.9/2 for fMRI localization of the eloquent cortex and 
lateralization of the language function and 1.7/2 for DTI-ft results. Treatment 
strategy was altered in 33% (9/27) of cases. Surgical entry point was modified 
in 8% (2/25) of cases. The extent of resection was modified in 40% (10/25). 
One patient (1/25, 4%) developed one new functional deficit post-operatively.
CONCLUSION: Functional MR mapping - which must not be considered an alternative 
to ESM - has a critical role preoperatively, potentially modifying treatment 
strategy or increasing the neurosurgeons' confidence in the surgical approach 
hypothesized based on conventional imaging.

Biocompatibility evaluation of antioxidant cocktail loaded gelatin 
methacrylamide as bioink for extrusion-based 3D bioprinting.

J AS(1), Velayudhan S(2), Pr AK(1).

Three-dimensional (3D) liver bioprinting is a promising technique for creating 
3D liver models that can be used forin vitrodrug testing, hepatotoxicity 
studies, and transplantation. The functional performance of 3D bioprinted liver 
constructs are limited by the lack of cell-cell interactions, which calls for 
the creation of bioprinted tissue constructs with high cell densities. This 
study reports the fabrication of 3D bioprinted liver constructs using a novel 
photocrosslinkable gelatin methacrylamide (GelMA)-based bioink formulation. 
However, the formation of excess free radicals during photoinitiation poses a 
challenge, particularly during photocrosslinking of large constructs with high 
cell densities. Hence, we designed a bioink formulation comprising the base 
polymer GelMA loaded with an antioxidant cocktail containing vitamin C 
(L-ascorbic acid (AA)) and vitamin E (α-tocopherol (α-Toc)). We confirmed that 
the combination of antioxidants loaded in GelMA enhanced the ability to scavenge 
intracellular reactive oxygen species formed during photocrosslinking. The GelMA 
formulation was evaluated for biocompatibilityin vitroandin vivo. These results 
demonstrated that the bioink had adequate rheological characteristics and was 
biocompatible. Furthermore, when compared to bioprinted constructs with lower 
cell density, high-density primary rat hepatocyte constructs demonstrated 
improved cell-cell interactions and liver-specific functions like albumin and 
urea secretion, which increased 5-fold and 2.5-fold, respectively.

Modelling climate change impacts at a drinking water reservoir in Turkey and 
implications for reservoir management in semi-arid regions.

Aibaidula D(1), Ates N(1), Dadaser-Celik F(2).

Climate change can have severe impacts on the water availability in semi-arid 
regions. In this study, we assessed the impact of climatic changes on water 
availability in the Altınapa Reservoir Watershed, located in the Konya province, 
south-central Turkey. Altınapa Reservoir supplies drinking water to Konya, a 
city of about 2 million population. We investigated possible changes in 
streamflow and reservoir storage over 2021-2098 under two representative 
concentration pathway scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) developed based on 
GFDL-ESM2M, HadGEM2-ES, and MPI-ESM-MR global circulation models. We used a 
physically based model (SWAT-Soil and Water Assessment Tool) for understanding 
the hydrologic response of the basin to climatic changes. Results show that 
upward trends in air temperatures in the range of 0.01-0.04 °C/year and 
0.005-0.06 °C/year are expected from 2021 to 2098 under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 
scenarios, respectively. According to the HadGEM2-ES model, precipitation and 
streamflow would show a downward trend at a rate of 0.96 mm/year and 0.007 
m3/s/year under the RCP4.5 scenario and at a rate of 1.62 mm/year and 0.01 
m3/s/year under the RCP8.5 scenario, respectively. GFDL-ESM2M and MPI-ESM-MR 
models project upward trends in precipitation and streamflow under the RCP4.5 
scenario (in the range of 0.64-1.28 mm/year and 0.0003-0.006 m3/s/year, 
respectively), and downward trends under the RCP8.5 scenario (in the range of 
0.47-0.76 mm/year and 0.0015-0.003 m3/s/year, respectively). Reservoir storage 
is projected to increase slightly according to GFDL-ESM2M model and decrease 
according to the HadGEM2-ES, and MPI-ESM-MR models under both scenarios. 
Precipitation, streamflow, and reservoir storage predictions of GFDL-ESM2M and 
MPI-ESM-MR models are considerably lower than those observed in the basin in 
recent decades, showing that water resources will decrease in the future. The 
changes in water withdrawal patterns could cause further reductions in water 
availability. Good resilience to climate change can be achieved by a flexible 
water management system and by reducing water consumption and water losses in 
the watershed and from the reservoirs.

Updated benchmarking of variant effect predictors using deep mutational 
scanning.

Livesey BJ(1), Marsh JA(1).

The assessment of variant effect predictor (VEP) performance is fraught with 
biases introduced by benchmarking against clinical observations. In this study, 
building on our previous work, we use independently generated measurements of 
protein function from deep mutational scanning (DMS) experiments for 26 human 
proteins to benchmark 55 different VEPs, while introducing minimal data 
circularity. Many top-performing VEPs are unsupervised methods including EVE, 
DeepSequence and ESM-1v, a protein language model that ranked first overall. 
However, the strong performance of recent supervised VEPs, in particular VARITY, 
shows that developers are taking data circularity and bias issues seriously. We 
also assess the performance of DMS and unsupervised VEPs for discriminating 
between known pathogenic and putatively benign missense variants. Our findings 
are mixed, demonstrating that some DMS datasets perform exceptionally at variant 
classification, while others are poor. Notably, we observe a striking 
correlation between VEP agreement with DMS data and performance in identifying 
clinically relevant variants, strongly supporting the validity of our rankings 
and the utility of DMS for independent benchmarking.

Serological Analysis Identifies Consequential B Cell Epitopes on the Flexible 
Linker and C-Terminus of Decorin Binding Protein A (DbpA) from Borrelia 
burgdorferi.

Movahed E(#)(1), Vance DJ(#)(1), Ehrbar D(1), Van Slyke G(1), Yates J(1), Kullas 
K(1), Rudolph M(2), Mantis NJ(1).

Decorin binding protein A (DbpA) is a surface adhesin of Borrelia burgdorferi, 
the causative agent of Lyme disease. While DbpA is one of the most immunogenic 
of B. burgdorferi's nearly 100 lipoproteins, the B cell epitopes on DbpA 
recognized by humans following B. burgdorferi infection have not been fully 
elucidated. In this report we profiled ~270 B. burgdorferi-seropositive human 
serum samples for IgM and IgG reactivity with a tiled DbpA 18-mer peptide array 
derived from B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strains B31 and 297. Using 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and multiplex immunoassays (MIA), we 
identified 12 DbpA-derived peptides whose antibody reactivities were 
significantly elevated (generally <10-fold) in B. burgdorferi-seropositive sera, 
compared to those measured in a healthy cohort. The most reactive peptide 
(>80-fold IgG, 10-fold IgM) corresponded to residues 64 to 81, which map to an 
exposed flexible loop between DbpA's α-helix 1 and α-helix 2. This loop, whose 
sequence is identical between strains B31 and 297, overhangs DbpA's substrate 
binding pocket. A second strongly reactive antibody target (>80-fold IgG, 3 to 
5-fold IgM) mapped to DbpA's C-terminus, a lysine rich tail implicated in 
attachment to glycosaminoglycans. We postulate that antibody responses against 
these two targets on DbpA could limit B.burgdorferi's ability to attach to and 
colonize distal tissues during the early stages of infection. IMPORTANCE The 
bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi, is the causative agent of Lyme disease, the 
most reported tick-borne illness in the United States. In humans, clinical 
manifestations of Lyme disease are complex and can persist for months, even in 
the face of a robust antibody response directed against numerous B. burgdorferi 
surface proteins, including decorin binding protein A (DbpA), which is involved 
in the early stages of infection. In this study we employed ~270 serum samples 
from B. burgdorferi-seropositive individuals to better understand human antibody 
reactivity to specific regions (called epitopes) of DbpA and how such antibodies 
may function in limiting B. burgdorferi dissemination and tissue colonization.

Speech Sound Disorder Treatment Approaches Used by School-Based Clinicians: An 
Application of the Experience Sampling Method.

Cabbage K(1), Farquharson K(2), DeVeney S(3).

PURPOSE: Children with speech sound disorders (SSDs) comprise a large portion of 
caseloads for school-based speech-language pathologists (SLPs). Despite the 
existence of several evidence-based SSD intervention approaches, the translation 
from research to practice is often limited by ecological validity because of 
various factors unique to school settings (e.g., scheduling constraints, 
caseload size, child availability). The purpose of this study was to use the 
experience sampling method (ESM) to examine the current practices of 
school-based SLPs when treating children with SSDs on their caseloads.
METHOD: SLPs (N = 106) from 42 different states working full-time in 
school-based K-12 settings participated in this study. At the beginning of the 
study, each SLP completed a one-time demographic survey about treatment 
practices for children with SSDs. The SLPs then participated in a series of 
brief surveys every day for one workweek using a specialized ESM phone 
application that randomly alerted participants to report on their treatment 
practices for children with SSDs.
RESULTS: Findings revealed that although most SLPs reported using a variety of 
SSD intervention approaches in a one-time survey, the majority of SLPs reported 
using one of three approaches in situ: the traditional articulation therapy 
approach, cycles, and minimal pairs. We also report a significant negative 
relationship between the years of experience of an SLP and the number of 
different approaches used.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to use the ESM to determine which 
approaches school-based SLPs use to treat children with SSDs. Findings 
demonstrate that SLPs have knowledge of many different SSD approaches but tend 
to utilize only a few in school-based settings.

Delayed affective recovery to daily-life stressors signals a risk for 
depression.

De Calheiros Velozo J(1), Lafit G(2), Viechtbauer W(3), van Amelsvoort T(4), 
Schruers K(4), Marcelis M(5), Goossens L(4), Simons CJP(5), Delespaul P(4), 
Claes S(6), Myin-Germeys I(7), Vaessen T(8).

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate the time to affective 
recovery from daily-life stressors between healthy controls (HC) and two groups 
with an increased risk for developing depression: individuals with subclinical 
symptoms of depression (SSD), and individuals remitted from a depressive episode 
with residual symptoms of depression (RRS).
METHOD: The experience sampling method (ESM) was used to measure affective 
recovery to daily-life stressors. Affective recovery was defined as the moment 
that negative affect (NA) returned to baseline level following the first 
stressful event of the day. We assessed two different operationalizations of the 
baseline: NA at the moment before the stressful event (t-1), and mean-person NA. 
The effect of stress intensity, and cumulative stress were also assessed.
RESULTS: Survival analyses showed significantly longer recovery times for the at 
risk groups in comparison to healthy individuals, albeit no significant 
difference was found between the two at risk groups (i.e. SSD and RRS). There 
was also an effect of cumulative stress, but not stress intensity on time to 
recovery in that cumulative stress resulted in significantly longer recovery 
times for all three groups.
LIMITATIONS: The present study is limited by the ESM sampling design, 
assessments take place post-stress and therefore do not capture peak stress. 
Additionally, we are only able to assess patterns at the group level. Finally, 
there is a significant age difference between groups.
CONCLUSION: Individuals at risk for depression display a delayed recovery to 
daily-life stressors when compared to healthy controls, which is not explained 
by differences in stress intensity or cumulative stress. Understanding what is 
driving this delay may help combat the development of depression.

Optimization of Extraction and Quality Evaluation of Abri Herba by Response 
Surface Methodology Combined with Quantitative Analysis of Multi-Components by a 
Single Marker.

Shen Y(1)(2), Li H(1)(2), Ding X(1)(2), Zhan Z(3), An Q(1)(4), Zheng Y(1)(5), 
Zhang D(1)(2).

BACKGROUND: Abri Herba (AH) is a famous medicinal and edible traditional Chinese 
medicine, which is usually used for liver disease. To date, few studies have 
been conducted on the ultrasonic extraction (UAE) process for AH and the 
application of quality analysis of multi-components by the single-marker (QAMS) 
method to evaluate the quality.
OBJECTIVE: To optimize the UAE process for AH, and develop and validate the 
quality evaluation of AH by the QAMS method.
METHODS: The UAE conditions of AH were optimized by response surface methodology 
with the total contents of protocatechuic acid, hydantoin, gardeniaine, 
vicenin-2, salvoside and isosalvoside as indicators, the ultrasonic time, 
methanol concentration and liquid to material ratio as parameters. The content 
of protocatechuic acid, hypaphorine, abrine, vicenin-2, schaftoside, and 
isoschaftoside in 12 batches of AH was first determined by the external standard 
method (ESM) using HPLC. After that, based on abrine as the internal standard, 
the relative correction factors (RCF) for protocatechuic acid, hypaphorine, 
vicenin-2, schaftoside and isoschaftoside were established, and the ESM method 
was used to verify the QAMS method.
RESULTS: The results show that the optimal extraction process parameters for AH 
are an ultrasonic time of 22 min, a methanol concentration of 45%, and liquid to 
material ratio of 26 (mL/g). The QAMS results show that the relative correction 
factor has good reproducibility, and there is no significant difference between 
the results of the ESM method and the QAMS method for each chemical constituent, 
indicating that the research is feasible.
CONCLUSION: The optimized extraction process of AH and the established 
QAMS-based quality control method are stable and can be used for the quality 
control of AH.
HIGHLIGHTS: A response surface methodology was used to optimize the ultrasonic 
extraction process for AH, and a QAMS method was established for evaluating the 
quality of AH.

N20D/N116E Combined Mutant Downward Shifted the pH Optimum of Bacillus subtilis 
NADH Oxidase.

Yang T(1), Pan L(1), Wu W(1), Pan X(1), Xu M(1), Zhang X(1), Rao Z(1).

Cofactor regeneration is indispensable to avoid the addition of large quantities 
of cofactor NADH or NAD+ in oxidation-reduction reactions. Water-forming NADH 
oxidase (Nox) has attracted substantive attention as it can oxidize cytosolic 
NADH to NAD+ without concomitant accumulation of by-products. However, its 
applications have some limitations in some oxidation-reduction processes when 
its optimum pH is different from its coupled enzymes. In this study, to modify 
the optimum pH of BsNox, fifteen relevant candidates of site-directed mutations 
were selected based on surface charge rational design. As predicted, the 
substitution of this asparagine residue with an aspartic acid residue (N22D) or 
with a glutamic acid residue (N116E) shifts its pH optimum from 9.0 to 7.0. 
Subsequently, N20D/N116E combined mutant could not only downshift the pH optimum 
of BsNox but also significantly increase its specific activity, which was about 
2.9-fold at pH 7.0, 2.2-fold at pH 8.0 and 1.2-fold at pH 9.0 that of the 
wild-type. The double mutant N20D/N116E displays a higher activity within a wide 
range of pH from 6 to 9, which is wider than the wide type. The usability of the 
BsNox and its variations for NAD+ regeneration in a neutral environment was 
demonstrated by coupling with a glutamate dehydrogenase for α-ketoglutaric acid 
(α-KG) production from L-glutamic acid (L-Glu) at pH 7.0. Employing the 
variation N20D/N116E as an NAD+ regeneration coenzyme could shorten the process 
duration; 90% of L-Glu were transformed into α-KG within 40 min vs. 70 min with 
the wild-type BsNox for NAD+ regeneration. The results obtained in this work 
suggest the promising properties of the BsNox variation N20D/N116E are competent 
in NAD+ regeneration applications under a neutral environment.

Temporal pathways from attachment insecurity to paranoia in a heterogeneous 
clinical sample: An experience sampling study.

Dančík D(1)(2), Hajdúk M(1)(2)(3), Januška J(1)(2), Straková A(1)(2), Heretik 
A(1)(2).

INTRODUCTION: There has been growing interest in the role of attachment 
mechanisms in the onset and maintenance of paranoia. The latest systematic 
reviews of mixed samples of healthy individuals and psychiatric patients have 
revealed that increased trait attachment anxiety and avoidance are associated 
with experiencing paranoia, with trait attachment anxiety showing a stronger 
association. Few studies have examined attachment and paranoia in naturalistic 
conditions via the Experience Sampling Method.
OBJECTIVES: The present study examined whether experiences of attachment anxiety 
and avoidance fluctuate in the flow of daily life, and whether a within-person 
change in both attachment states precedes the experience of momentary paranoia, 
and negative and positive emotions.
METHODS: Thirty-seven clinical participants and twenty-six healthy controls were 
studied over six consecutive days using the Experience Sampling Method (ESM). An 
experience-in-close-relationships questionnaire (ECR-R 16 SF) was used to 
capture trait attachment dimensions. Several ESM items were used to capture 
momentary negative and positive affect, paranoia and attachment insecurity 
states.
RESULTS: The findings revealed that fluctuations in both attachment insecurity 
states were significantly higher in the clinical group. A prior elevated 
attachment anxiety and avoidance was followed by an increase in negative affect 
in the next moment and elevated attachment avoidance was additionally followed 
by a decrease in positive affect and an increase in paranoia.
CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal the specific temporal associations between 
momentary attachment insecurity states as predictors of change in 
emotions/affects and paranoia, along with evidence that state attachment 
avoidance has a superior impact on momentary affect and paranoia compared to 
state attachment anxiety. These results contrast with those of recent 
cross-sectional studies.

Multimodal approach leads to seizure-freedom in a case of highly refractory 
drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

Smith KM(1), Alden EC(2), Simpson HD(1)(3)(4), Brinkmann BH(1), Gregg NM(1), 
Miller KJ(5), Lundstrom BN(1).

Drug-resistant, nonlesional, extratemporal lobe focal epilepsy can be difficult 
to treat and may require a high degree of multidisciplinary teamwork to localize 
the seizure onset zone for resective surgery. Here, we describe a patient with 
longstanding drug-resistant, nonlesional, extratemporal focal epilepsy with a 
high seizure burden who became seizure-free after prolonged evaluation and 
eventual left frontal cortical resection. Prior evaluations included 
magnetoencephalography, invasive video-EEG monitoring, and implantation of a 
responsive neurostimulation (RNS) device for ongoing intracranial stimulation. 
Highly sophisticated techniques were utilized including stereotactic 
localization of prior evaluations to guide repeat stereo-EEG (SEEG), electrical 
stimulation mapping, SEEG-guided radiofrequency ablation, and awake resection 
with language and motor mapping using a cognitive testing platform . 
Incorporating a wide array of data from multiple centers and evaluation time 
periods was necessary to optimize seizure control and minimize the risk of 
neurological deficits from surgery.

Sympathectomy Effects on Intra-Abdominal Organ Catecholamine Levels in a 
Streptozotocin-Induced Diabetic Rat Model.

Pérez-Juárez A(1), Aguirre-Pérez AG(2), Barrientos-Alvarado C(1).

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder whose prevalence has continuously 
increased worldwide and is associated with dysfunction of the autonomic nervous 
system and, in particular, that of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). The 
objective of this study was to analyze the interaction of DM and the SNS, 
building a model of sympathectomized diabetic rats to determine alterations in 
the content of CA (catecholamines) in different intra-abdominal organs. 
Sympathectomy was conducted with guanethidine (GNT). Additionally, DM was 
induced with STZ (Streptozotocin). Treatment with GNT decreased norepinephrine 
(NE) content in all analyzed tissues, with significant differences found in the 
paraganglia, liver, pancreas, duodenum, and heart compared to the control group. 
With respect to epinephrine (E), which was only found in the liver, pancreas, 
and heart, presenting significant differences (p < 0.05) in the heart, a 
decrease in its concentration was observed for all of the experimental groups 
with respect to the control. The decrease in dopamine (DA) content due to the 
GNT−STZ treatment was 30.1% in the heart with respect to the diabetic (STZ) 
group. The amount of CA in the adrenal medulla indicates the effect of 
sympathectomy on the GNT group where there was a significant reduction (p < 
0.05) of DA. These findings suggest that the elimination of the sympathetic 
nervous system in diabetic organisms contributed to a decrease in blood glucose; 
likewise, an alteration in the levels of CA was observed in the different 
selected organs, possibly attributed to the severity, duration, and pathogenesis 
of the complications of acute and chronic DM.

A simple soil mass correction for a more accurate determination of soil carbon 
stock changes.

Fowler AF(1), Basso B(2)(3), Millar N(1), Brinton WF(4)(5).

Agricultural soils can act as a sink for large quantities of soil organic carbon 
(SOC) but can also be sources of carbon to the atmosphere. The international 
standard for assessing SOC stock and measuring stock change stipulates fixed 
depth sampling to at least 30 cm. The tendency of bulk density (BD) to decrease 
with decreasing disturbance and increasing SOC concentration and the assumption 
of constant SOC and BD within this depth profile promotes error in the estimates 
of SOC stock. A hypothetical but realistic change in BD from 1.5 to 1.1 g cm-3 
from successive fixed depth sampling to 30 cm underestimates SOC stock change by 
17%. Significant effort has been made to evaluate and reduce this fixed depth 
error by using the equivalent soil mass (ESM) approach, but with limited 
adoption. We evaluate the error in SOC stock assessment and change generated 
from fixed depth measurements over time relative to the ESM approach and propose 
a correction that can be readily adopted under current sampling and analytical 
methods. Our approach provides a more accurate estimate of SOC stock 
accumulation or loss that will help incentivize management practice changes that 
reduce the environmental impacts of agriculture and further legitimize the 
accounting practices used by the emerging carbon market and organizations that 
have pledged to reduce their supply chain greenhouse gas (GHG) footprints.

The Crystal Structure of Mouse Ces2c, a Potential Ortholog of Human CES2, Shows 
Structural Similarities in Substrate Regulation and Product Release to Human 
CES1.

Members of the carboxylesterase 2 (Ces2/CES2) family have been studied 
intensively with respect to their hydrolytic function on (pro)drugs, whereas 
their physiological role in lipid and energy metabolism has been realized only 
within the last few years. Humans have one CES2 gene which is highly expressed 
in liver, intestine, and kidney. Interestingly, eight homologous Ces2 (Ces2a to 
Ces2h) genes exist in mice and the individual roles of the corresponding 
proteins are incompletely understood. Mouse Ces2c (mCes2c) is suggested as 
potential ortholog of human CES2. Therefore, we aimed at its structural and 
biophysical characterization. Here, we present the first crystal structure of 
mCes2c to 2.12 Å resolution. The overall structure of mCes2c resembles that of 
the human CES1 (hCES1). The core domain adopts an α/β hydrolase-fold with S230, 
E347, and H459 forming a catalytic triad. Access to the active site is 
restricted by the cap, the flexible lid, and the regulatory domain. The 
conserved gate (M417) and switch (F418) residues might have a function in 
product release similar as suggested for hCES1. Biophysical characterization 
confirms that mCes2c is a monomer in solution. Thus, this study broadens our 
understanding of the mammalian carboxylesterase family and assists in 
delineating the similarities and differences of the different family members.

Explaining variation in adolescents' social media-related distraction: The role 
of social connectivity and disconnectivity factors.

Siebers T(1), Beyens I(1), Pouwels JL(2), Valkenburg PM(1).

Social media are often believed to distract adolescents' attention. While 
existing research has shown that some adolescents experience more social 
media-related distraction than others, the explanations for these differences 
remain largely unknown. Based on Self-Determination Theory, this preregistered 
study investigated two social connectivity factors (fear of missing out [FoMO] 
and friendship accessibility expectations) and two disconnectivity factors 
(self-control strategies and parental restrictions) that may explain 
heterogeneity in social media-related distraction. We used data collected 
through a measurement burst design, consisting of a three-week experience 
sampling method study among 300 adolescents (21,970 assessments) and online 
surveys. Using N = 1 analyses, we found that most adolescents (77%) experienced 
social media-related distraction. Contrary to expectations, none of the 
connectivity or disconnectivity factors explained differences in social 
media-related distraction. The findings indicate that social media are a 
powerful distractor many adolescents seem to struggle with.

A heme pocket aromatic quadrupole modulates gas binding to cytochrome c'-β: 
Implications for NO sensors.

Adams HR(1), Svistunenko DA(1), Wilson MT(1), Fujii S(2), Strange RW(1), Hardy 
ZA(3), Vazquez PA(3), Dabritz T(3), Streblow GJ(3), Andrew CR(4), Hough MA(5).

The structural basis by which gas-binding heme proteins control their 
interactions with NO, CO, and O2 is fundamental to enzymology, biotechnology, 
and human health. Cytochromes c' (cyts c') are a group of putative NO-binding 
heme proteins that fall into two families: the well-characterized four alpha 
helix bundle fold (cyts c'-α) and an unrelated family with a large beta-sheet 
fold (cyts c'-β) resembling that of cytochromes P460. A recent structure of cyt 
c'-β from Methylococcus capsulatus Bath revealed two heme pocket phenylalanine 
residues (Phe 32 and Phe 61) positioned near the distal gas-binding site. This 
feature, dubbed the "Phe cap," is highly conserved within the sequences of other 
cyts c'-β but is absent in their close homologs, the hydroxylamine-oxidizing 
cytochromes P460, although some do contain a single Phe residue. Here, we report 
an integrated structural, spectroscopic, and kinetic characterization of cyt 
c'-β from Methylococcus capsulatus Bath complexes with diatomic gases, focusing 
on the interaction of the Phe cap with NO and CO. Significantly, 
crystallographic and resonance Raman data show that orientation of the 
electron-rich aromatic ring face of Phe 32 toward distally bound NO or CO is 
associated with weakened backbonding and higher off rates. Moreover, we propose 
that an aromatic quadrupole also contributes to the unusually weak backbonding 
reported for some heme-based gas sensors, including the mammalian NO sensor, 
soluble guanylate cyclase. Collectively, this study sheds light on the influence 
of highly conserved distal Phe residues on heme-gas complexes of cytochrome 
c'-β, including the potential for aromatic quadrupoles to modulate NO and CO 
binding in other heme proteins.

Study of exopolysaccharide produced by Streptomyces rochie strain OF1 and its 
effect as ameliorative on osteoarthritis in rats via inhibiting TNF-α/COX2 
pathway.

Mohamed SS(1), El Awady ME(1), Abdelhamid SA(2), Hamed AA(3), Salama AAA(4), 
Selim MS(1).

BACKGROUND: Carbohydrates are known as the main natural products of life 
activities.
RESULTS: Streptomyces rochie strain OF1 isolated from a mangrove tree produced 
exopolysaccharide S5 (EPSS5) (14.2 gl-1) containing uronic acid 21.98% sulfate 
content of 11.65 mg/ml, and a viscosity of 1.35 mm2/s. while total hexose amine 
content was 24.72%. The high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis 
of mono sugars revealed that EPS was composed of manouronic acid, glucuronic 
acid, xylose, and fructose at a molar ratio of 1.0:0.5:1.0:2.0, respectively. It 
showed that the whole antioxidant activity was 92.06%. It showed antibacterial 
activity against Staphylococcus aureus, and E. coli, MRSA and Klebsiella 
pneumoniae. But, EPSS5 displayed low antifungal activity against Candida 
albicans. While no antifungal activity has been detected against Aspergillus 
niger. EPSS5 has antibiofilm action that is noticeable toward S. aureus with an 
inhibition ratio of biofilm up to 50%. Effect of EPS on serum levels of TNF-α 
and COX2 by 2 fold and 1.9 fold of EPS reduced serum levels of Tumor necrosis 
factor-α (TNF-α) by 38%, 12%, 49%, and Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) by 61%, 34%, and 
62%, respectively. By affected of EPSS5 on arthritis in rats stimulated by 
carrageenan.
CONCLUSIONS: Administration of EPS ameliorated carrageen-induced elevation in 
inflammatory mediators; TNF-α/COX and suppressed the expressions of 
metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) by 68%, 86%, and 75% correspondingly in comparison to 
the group of carrageenans. Then again, therapy involving a high dose only 
reduced MMP9 level by 57%, compared to free drug suggesting that EPSS5 is a good 
inhibitor of the MMP9, as it brought MMP9 back to normal levels via the 
signaling pathway.

Alpha-galactosylceramide as adjuvant induces protective cell-mediated immunity 
against Leishmania mexicana infection in vaccinated BALB/c mice.

Diupotex M(1), Zamora-Chimal J(1), Cervantes-Sarabia RB(1), Salaiza-Suazo N(1), 
Becker I(2).

Adjuvants represent a promising strategy to improve vaccine effectiveness 
against infectious diseases such as leishmaniasis. Vaccination with the 
invariant natural killer T cell ligand α-galactosylceramide (αGalCer) has been 
used successfully as adjuvant, generating a Th1-biased immunomodulation. This 
glycolipid enhances experimental vaccination platforms against intracellular 
parasites including Plasmodium yoelii and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In the 
present study, we assessed the protective immunity induced by a single-dose 
intraperitoneal injection of αGalCer (2 μg) co-administrated with a lysate 
antigen of amastigotes (100 μg) against Leishmania mexicana infection in BALB/c 
mice. The prophylactic vaccination led to 5.0-fold reduction of parasite load at 
the infection site, compared to non-vaccinated mice. A predominant 
pro-inflammatory response was observed in challenged vaccinated mice, 
represented by a 1.9 and 2.8-fold-increase of IL-1β and IFN-γ producing cells, 
respectively, in the lesions, and by 23.7-fold-increase of IFN-γ production in 
supernatants of restimulated splenocytes, all compared to control groups. The 
co-administration of αGalCer also stimulated the maturation of splenic dendritic 
cells and modulated a Th1-skewed immune response, with high amounts of IFN-γ 
production in serum. Furthermore, peritoneal cells of αGalCer-immunized mice 
exhibited an elevated expression of Ly6G and MHCII. These findings indicate that 
αGalCer improves protection against cutaneous leishmaniasis, supporting evidence 
for its potential use as adjuvant in Leishmania-vaccines.

Roflumilast ameliorates diabetic nephropathy in rats through down-regulation of 
JAK/STAT signaling pathway.

Patel P(1), Patel S(2), Chudasama P(3), Soni S(4), Raval M(5).

Roflumilast is a potent selective inhibitor of the phosphodiesterase-4 enzyme 
which greatly manifest an anti-inflammatory activity in chronic obstructive 
pulmonary patients. Inflammation is a prominent factor in the prevalence of 
diabetic nephropathy, one of the most prevalent microvascular complications of 
Diabetes Mellitus. The present study was undertaken to assess the potential role 
of roflumilast in diabetic nephropathy. The model was developed by feeding a 
high-fat diet for four weeks and following streptozotocin (30 mg/kg) injection 
intraperitoneally. The rats with > 13.8 mmol/L blood glucose were treated with 
roflumilast (0.25, 0.5, 1 mg/kg) and standard metformin (100 mg/kg) orally once 
a day for eight weeks. Roflumilast (1 mg/kg) remarkably improved renal damage, 
indicated by an increase in 16% albumin, a decrease in 5% serum creatinine, 12% 
BUN, 19% HbA1c, and 34% blood glucose. It also significantly improves the 
oxidative stress levels, which was indicated by a decrease in 18% MDA level and 
an increase in GSH, SOD, and catalase by 6%, 4%, and 5%, respectively. In 
addition, Roflumilast (1 mg/kg) decreased the HOMA-IR index by 28% and increased 
the pancreatic β-cells functioning by 30%. Moreover, significant improvement in 
histopathological abnormalities were observed in roflumilast treatment groups. 
Roflumilast treatment was shown to down-regulate the gene expressions of TNF-α 
(2.1-fold), NF-kB (2.3-fold), MCP-1 (2.5-fold), fibronectin (2.7-fold), collagen 
IV (2.7-fold), STAT 1(1.06-fold), and STAT 3 (1.20-fold) and upregulated the 
expression of the Nrf2 (1.43-fold) gene. Roflumilast manifested a potential role 
in diabetic nephropathy as a renoprotective agent. Roflumilast effectively 
down-regulates the JAK/STAT pathway and restores renal functions.

Momentarily narcissistic? Development of a short, state version of the 
Pathological Narcissism Inventory applicable in momentary assessment.

Engyel M(1)(2), de Ruiter NMP(3), Urbán R(2).

BACKGROUND: Narcissism viewed as a personality process rather than a stable 
trait explains narcissistic functioning as a tool for maintaining a positive 
self-view. Studying narcissism therefore needs adequate momentary measures for 
collecting higher frequency longitudinal data in experience sampling method 
(ESM) studies. In this study, a shorter version of the Pathological Narcisissm 
Inventory is offered to measure vulnerable and grandiose narcissistic states, 
applicable in momentary assessment.
METHODS: The measurement tool was tested in three samples. First, we assessed 
the factor structure and associations with other contemporary measures of 
narcissism in a cross-sectional design on one English speaking (n = 319) and one 
Hungarian sample (n = 236). Second, we conducted a five-day long experience 
sampling method study with a total of 15 measurement points (n = 123).
RESULTS: Based on structural equation modelling and multilevel analyses, the 
results suggest that the measure has adequate psychometric properties in both 
the within and between subject levels as well as acceptable convergent and 
discriminant validity.
CONCLUSIONS: The Pathological Narcissism Inventory - State Version (PNI-S) can 
be a useful tool in momentary data collection enabling the examination of 
personality processes behind narcissistic functioning.

Using Experience Sampling Methods to support clinical management of psychosis: 
The perspective of people with lived experience.

de Thurah L(1), Kiekens G(2), Sips R(1), Teixeira A(1), Kasanova Z(3), 
Myin-Germeys I(1).

The Experience sampling method (ESM) has the potential to support 
person-centered care of psychotic disorders. However, clinical implementation is 
hampered by a lack of user involvement in the design of ESM tools. This 
qualitative study explored the perspective of nine people with lived experiences 
of psychosis. Participants reported a need to monitor a diverse range of 
daily-life experiences and indicated that ESM should allow for personalization 
to be clinically useful. While participants recognized the potential of ESM to 
increase awareness and control over their mental health, concerns were voiced 
about the validity and burden of monitoring one's own mental health.

Evaluation of a 3D Computer Model of the Equine Paranasal Sinuses as a Tool for 
Veterinary Anatomy Education.

Canright A(1), Bescoby S(2), Dickson J(3).

Detailed knowledge of anatomical systems is vital for clinical veterinary 
practice. However, students often find it difficult to transfer skills learned 
from textbooks to real-life practice. In this study, a three-dimensional 
computer model representing equine paranasal sinus anatomy (3D-ESM) was created 
and evaluated for its contribution to student understanding of the 3D dynamic 
nature of the system. Veterinary students and equine professionals at the 
University of Bristol were randomly allocated into experimental (3D model) and 
control (2D lecture) groups. A pre-/post-study design was used to evaluate the 
efficacy of the 3D model through a pre-/post-multiple-choice question (MCQ) 
anatomical knowledge exam and a pre-/post-questionnaire gathering information on 
participant demographics, confidence, and satisfaction. No statistically 
significant difference was found between 3D and 2D groups' post-MCQ exam scores 
(t39 = 1.289, p = .205). 3D group participant feedback was more positive than 2D 
group feedback, and 3D group satisfaction scores on Likert questions were 
significantly higher (t118 = -5.196, p < .001). Additionally, confidence scores 
were significantly higher in the 3D group than in the 2D group immediately 
following the study (p < .05). Participants' open-text responses indicated they 
found the 3D model helpful in learning the complex anatomy of the equine 
paranasal sinuses. Findings suggest the 3D-ESM is an effective educational tool 
that aids in confidence, enjoyment, and knowledge acquisition. Though it was not 
better than traditional methods in terms of anatomy knowledge exam scores, the 
model is a valuable inclusion into the veterinary anatomy curriculum.

Do Men and Women Have a Different Association between Fear-Avoidance and Pain 
Intensity in Chronic Pain? An Experience Sampling Method Cohort-Study.

Waardenburg S(1)(2), Visseren L(3)(4), van Daal E(1), Brouwer B(1), van Zundert 
J(1)(5), van Kuijk SMJ(2), Lousberg R(4), Jongen EMM(6), Leue C(7), de Meij 
N(1).

BACKGROUND: Fear-avoidance is one of the factors associated with chronic pain. 
However, it remains unclear whether the association between fear-avoidance and 
pain depends on sex. The present study aimed to investigate whether the 
association between fear-avoidance and pain intensity differed between men and 
women in chronic pain patients. Additionally, the potential confounding effect 
of affective experiences on the association between fear-avoidance and pain 
intensity was analyzed.
METHOD: This cohort study included hospital referred chronic pain patients (n = 
45). Short momentary assessment questions according to the experience sampling 
method (ESM) were used to repeatedly assess patients' pain intensity, level of 
fear-avoidance and positive as well as negative affect during their daily life. 
Linear mixed-effects models were applied in the statistical analysis. Unadjusted 
and adjusted models were made, in which the latter corrected for statistically 
significant affective experiences and baseline variables, taking the Aikake 
Information Criterion into account to assess a better model of fit.
RESULTS: The results demonstrated an association between fear-avoidance and pain 
intensity that differed for men and women. In men (n = 13), no association 
between these variables was found (-0.04 (95% CI: -0.14, 0.06) with a p-value of 
0.48), whereas in women (n = 32), an increase in fear-avoidance was associated 
with a (slight) increase in pain intensity (0.18 (95% CI 0.06, 0.30) with a 
p-value of 0.003). Affect did not confound the above-mentioned findings.
CONCLUSION: Our data supports previous research highlighting the importance of 
sex differences in pain experience. These findings may be relevant for 
clinicians to consider more personalized (i.e., gender specific) pain management 
in chronic pain patients.

The opening workspace control strategy of a novel manipulator-driven emission 
source microscopy system.

Liu X(1), Li X(2), Su H(3), Zhao Y(4), Ge SS(2).

Emission source microscopy (ESM) technique can be utilized for localization of 
electromagnetic interference sources in the electronic systems, but its accuracy 
is limited by the typical planar scanning mode. In order to increase the 
accuracy, this paper presents a novel cylinder-aperture ESM measurement system 
driven by 6-DOF manipulator, and investigated the control strategy to generate 
the maximum-area aperture and optimized scanning trajectory. Based on the 
multiple constraints of the cylinder-aperture ESM measurement, we proposes 
analyzing the impact of the constraints by steps. This can obtain the analytical 
solution of the manipulator workspace and support solving the maximum aperture 
area. Besides, a modified RRT*(Rapidly-exploring Random Trees) algorithm is 
addressed to optimize the manipulator trajectory. The simulation and tests have 
proven that this algorithm could obviously reduce the joint mutation and 
cumulative tracking error. In the experimental section, the near-field scanning 
(NFS) tests, planar-aperture ESM measurement and proposed cylinder-aperture ESM 
measurement were conducted to measure one benchmark emission source. The results 
have demonstrated that the cylinder-aperture ESM measurement has the best 
convergences on the radiation pattern of the emission source.

Autoimmune regulator (AIRE): Takes a hypoxia-inducing factor 1A (HIF1A) route to 
regulate FOXP3 expression in PCOS.

Padmanabhan RA(1), Johnson BS(1), Dhyani AK(1), Pillai SM(2), Jayakrishnan K(3), 
Laloraya M(1).

PROBLEM: Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis- ectodermal dystrophy 
(APECED) pathology due to autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene mutations leads to 
loss of central tolerance triggering immune attack, a factor causing 
infertility. One of the targets of autoimmune attack is ovary and its 
repercussion results in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Although reduced 
Tregs have been reported in PCOS, a lacunae exists on the status of AIRE gene 
expression and its role in treg insufficiency via HIF1A-FOXP3 axis in PCOS.
METHOD OF STUDY: This is a case-control cohort study recruiting 40 normal and 40 
PCOS volunteers for peripheral blood sample collection and PCOS diagnoses were 
based on Rotterdam Consensus criteria. AIRE and HIF1A expression status was 
analysed by qRT PCR and western blot. FACS analyses was conducted on AIRE 
silenced peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after Treg induction.
RESULTS: Our results indicate a reduced AIRE (fold change log2 (RQ) = -2.6, P < 
.01) and increased HIF1A (fold change log2 (RQ) = 3.6, P < .02) in PBMCs of PCOS 
subjects compared to age-matched controls. Western blot of AIRE and HIF1A 
corroborates with qRT PCR data. Our CHIP data demonstrate AIRE mediated HIF1A 
promoter regulation. Silencing of AIRE in PBMCs contributes to the upregulation 
of HIF1A transcripts by two-fold (P < .0015) and downregulation in FOXP3 
expression by three-fold (P < .0017). FACS analyses revealed that silencing of 
AIRE reduces Tcell to Treg conversion.
CONCLUSIONS: Our consolidated results derive a new connection among 
AIRE-HIF1A-FOXP3 with AIRE reduction enabling increased HIF1A resulting in 
reduced FOXP3 in PBMCs of PCOS patients leading to Treg insufficiency.

Predominance of inhalation route in short-range transmission of respiratory 
viruses: Investigation based on computational fluid dynamics.

Chen W(1), Liu L(2), Hang J(3), Li Y(1)(4).

During the Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, short-range virus transmission has 
been observed to have a higher risk of causing infection than long-range virus 
transmission. However, the roles played by the inhalation and large droplet 
routes cannot be distinguished in practice. A recent analytical study revealed 
the predominance of short-range inhalation over the large droplet spray route as 
causes of respiratory infections. In the current study, short-range exposure was 
analyzed via computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations using a discrete 
phase model. Detailed facial membranes, including eyes, nostrils, and a mouth, 
were considered. In CFD simulations, there is no need for a spherical 
approximation of the human head for estimating deposition nor the "anisokinetic 
aerosol sampling" approximation for estimating inhalation in the analytical 
model. We considered two scenarios (with two spheres [Scenario 1] and two human 
manikins [Scenario 2]), source-target distances of 0.2 to 2 m, and droplet 
diameters of 3 to 1,500 µm. The overall CFD exposure results agree well with 
data previously obtained from a simple analytical model. The CFD results confirm 
the predominance of the short-range inhalation route beyond 0.2 m for expiratory 
droplets smaller than 50 µm during talking and coughing. A critical droplet size 
of 87.5 µm was found to differentiate droplet behaviors. The number of droplets 
deposited on the target head exceeded those exposed to facial membranes, which 
implies a risk of exposure through the immediate surface route over a short 
range.

Numerical evaluation of the use of vegetation as a shelterbelt for enhancing the 
wind and thermal comfort in peripheral and lateral-type skygardens in highrise 
buildings.

Mohammadi M(1), Tien PW(1), Calautit JK(1).

Skygardens or skycourts are a unique architectural intervention in the built 
environment, enhancing the social, economic, and environmental values of the 
building. It allows occupants to connect and experience outdoor freshness within 
a semi-enclosed environment. However, skygardens located on a highrise building 
may generate intense wind gusts, endangering the safety of occupants. Using a 
validated computational fluid dynamics model, this study investigates the 
potential of various vegetative barriers or shelterbelts in attenuating the high 
wind speeds encountered in such spaces and the impact on wind and thermal 
comfort. Three skygarden configurations were investigated with and without 
vegetative barriers, simplified and modelled as porous zones, and their effect 
was studied on the velocity and temperature profile at the occupants' level. The 
results indicate that while hedges and trees can offer resistance to airflow, 
trees provide higher temperature reduction. However, a combination of vegetative 
and geometrical barriers provides the most optimal condition in the skygarden. 
The study has identified the importance of assessing wind attenuation 
characteristics of tree plantations on highrise skygarden, and the results can 
be used in designing intervention strategies. Moreover, vegetation can attenuate 
pollutants and mitigate poor air quality by surface deposition, and future 
studies should investigate in that direction.

Multiplexed Protein Detection and Parallel Binding Kinetics Analysis with 
Label-Free Digital Single-Molecule Counting.

Zhou X(1)(2), Wang R(1), Wan Z(1)(3), Zhang P(1)(4), Wang S(1)(2).

Multiplexed protein detection is critical for improving the drug and biomarker 
screening efficiency. Here, we show that multiplexed protein detection and 
parallel protein interaction analysis can be realized by evanescent scattering 
microscopy (ESM). ESM enables binding kinetics measurement with label-free 
digital single-molecule counting. We implemented an automatic single-molecule 
counting strategy with high temporal resolution to precisely determine the 
binding time, which improves the counting efficiency and accuracy. We show that 
digital single-molecule counting can recognize proteins with different molecular 
weights, thus making it possible to monitor the protein binding processes in the 
solution by real-time tracking of the numbers of free and bound proteins landing 
on the sensor surface. Furthermore, we show that this strategy can 
simultaneously analyze the kinetics of two different protein interaction 
processes on the surface and in the solution. This work may pave a way to 
investigate complicated protein interactions, such as the competition of 
biomarker-antibody binding in biofluids with biomarker-protein binding on the 
cellular membrane.

Alterations in the expression pattern of RBC membrane associated proteins 
(RMAPs) in whole body γ-irradiated Sprague Dawley rats.

Mukherjee P(1), Kumar K(1), Babu B(1), Purkayastha J(1), Chandna S(1).

PURPOSE: Peripheral blood serum/plasma proteins are frequently studied for their 
potential use as radiation exposure biomarkers. Here we report RBC membrane 
associated proteins (RMAPs), which show alterations in expression level 
following whole-body γ-irradiation of rats at sub-lethal/lethal doses.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: RBCs from peripheral blood of Sprague Dawley rats were 
segregated using the Ficoll-Hypaque method, and membrane fractions were 
hypotonically isolated at various time points (6 h, 24 h, 48 h) after 
γ-irradiation at 2 Gy, 5 Gy, and 7.5 Gy doses. Following purification of 
proteins from these fractions, two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) was 
carried out. Treatment induced differentially expressed protein spots (≥2 fold 
increase/decrease) were picked up, trypsinized, and identified using LC-MS/MS 
analysis. Western immunoblots using protein specific antibodies were used to 
confirm the results. Gene ontology and interactions of these proteins were also 
studied.
RESULTS: From a number of differentially expressed radiation-responsive 2-DE 
protein spots detected, eight were identified unequivocally using LC-MS/MS. Out 
of these, actin, cytoplasmic 1 (ACTB) showed detectable yet insignificant 
variation (<50%) in expression. In contrast, peroxiredoxin-2 (PRDX2) and 26S 
proteasome regulatory subunit RPN11 (PSMD14) were the two most prominently 
over-expressed proteins. Five more proteins, namely tropomyosin alpha-3 chain 
(TPM3), exosome component 6 (EXOSC6), isoform 4 of tropomyosin alpha-1 chain 
(TPM1), serum albumin (ALB), and the 55 kDa erythrocyte membrane protein (P55) 
showed distinct alteration in their expression at different time-points and 
doses. ALB, EXOSC6, and PSMD14 were the most responsive at 2 Gy, albeit at 
different time-points. While EXOSC6 and PSMD14 showed maximum over-expression 
(5-12 fold) at 6 h post-irradiation, ALB expression increased progressively (4 
up to 7 fold) from 6 h to 48 h. TPM1 showed over-expression (2-3 fold) at all 
doses and time-points tested. TPM3 showed a dose-dependent response at all 
time-points studied; with no variation at 2 Gy, ∼2 fold increase at 5 Gy, and 
3-6 fold at the highest dose used (7.5 Gy). The p55 protein was over-expressed 
(∼2.5 fold) only transiently at 24 h following the lethal (7.5 Gy) dose.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study to report γ-radiation induced alterations in 
the RBC membrane associated proteins. We are further evaluating the potential of 
these proteins as radiation biomarkers. Due to the abundance and easy use of 
RBCs, this approach can prove very useful for detecting ionizing radiation 
exposure.

Staff and ward factors associated with aggression development on an acute closed 
psychiatric ward: an experience sampling method study.

Weltens I(1), Drukker M(2), van Amelsvoort T(2), Bak M(2).

Aggression on psychiatric wards develops under influence of patient, staff and 
ward factors. Assessment of naturalistic derived staff and ward factors might 
increase better understanding of how aggressive incidents develop on psychiatric 
wards.
OBJECTIVE: Studying staff and ward factors including interactions between 
patients and nurses prior and after development of aggression, within a 
naturalistic closed ward setting.
DESIGN: A prospective naturalistic experience sampling method (ESM) study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A high intensive care unit of a mental health 
institution in The Netherlands where 29 nurses answered beeps generated by an 
app during approximately 7 consecutive days with questions regarding their 
subjective feelings, ward atmosphere, location, interaction they had with 
patients and their colleagues and whether an incident took place.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Associations were established between different staff and 
ward factors and the occurrence of aggressive incidents on the ward.
RESULTS: Risk for aggression was associated with the nurse being with a patient 
(OR=2.26, 95% CI 0.99 to 5.15, p=0.05). No significant association was found 
between discussing with the patient and setting a limit or physical absence of 
the nurse on the one hand and aggression on the other. More experienced nurses 
encountered more aggression (OR=3.5, 95% CI 1.32 to 8.26, p=0.01). Age and 
gender of the nurse were not associated with aggression development. Exceeding 
the maximum bed capacity was associated with a greater risk for aggression 
(OR=5.36, 95% CI 1.69 to 16.99, p=0.004). There was no significant association 
when analysing a more positive atmosphere on the ward or positive affect of the 
nurse, but negative affect of the nurses showed a trend for an association with 
less aggression.
CONCLUSION: Aggression is a problem that should be managed from a 
multidimensional perspective. The quality of interaction between nurses and 
patients is crucial. Exceeding the maximum bed capacity is likely associated 
with more aggression.

"I Know Myself Again, Which Makes Me Motivated for Life": Feasibility and 
Acceptability of Using Experience Sampling Methods With Trauma-Exposed Sexual 
Minority Women.

Scheer JR(1), Cascalheira CJ(1)(2), Helminen EC(1)(3), Shaw TJ(4), Schwarz 
AA(1), Jaipuriar V(1), Brisbin CD(5), Batchelder AW(6)(7)(8), Sullivan TP(9), 
Jackson SD(10).

Intensive longitudinal designs (e.g., experience sampling methods [ESMs]) hold 
promise for examining the dynamic interplay between daily adversity, coping 
strategies, and behavioral and mental health issues among marginalized 
populations. However, few studies have used intensive longitudinal designs with 
sexual minority women (SMW), an understudied and at-risk population. We assessed 
feasibility and acceptability of using once-daily, interval-contingent ESM with 
161 trauma-exposed SMW (Mage = 29.1, SD = 7.57); 20.5% nonbinary; 32.3% queer; 
52.2% people of color; 14.3% with annual incomes ≤$9,999; and 30.4% in Southern 
United States (U.S.). SMW completed one comprehensive online baseline assessment 
and once-daily brief online assessments for 14 days. Daily surveys assessed 
past-24-hour stressors, stress responses, and behavioral and mental health 
symptoms. At the end of the 14-day ESM period, SMW answered three open-ended 
questions about participating in this study and about research with SMW. 
Regarding feasibility, 151 participants (94.0%) initiated the post-baseline ESM 
study portion and 72 (45.0%) completed all 14 daily surveys. An average of 11.70 
(median = 13, SD = 3.31) daily surveys (83.5%) were completed by those who 
initiated the ESM. ESM completion level varied by race/ethnicity and U.S. 
region. Qualitative acceptability data revealed several themes, namely that SMW 
(1) enjoyed participating and felt positively about the ESM experience, (2) felt 
supported to reflect on impacts of early and ongoing stressors, (3) appreciated 
the chance to self-reflect and challenge existing thought patterns and coping 
behaviors, (4) recognized their capacity to tolerate trauma-related distress, 
(5) recommended that researchers focus on SMW's diverse stressors and daily 
experiences, (6) wanted a rationale for providing sensitive information and more 
space to narrate their experiences, and (7) recognized the need for affirmative 
treatment and policies. Findings could inform modifications to ESM protocols to 
improve their feasibility and acceptability among trauma-exposed SMW and promote 
ongoing utility of this valuable method.

Using the experience sampling method to support clinical practice: An 
illustration with problematic cannabis use.

Piccirillo ML(1)(2), Enkema MC(1), Foster KT(1)(3).

OBJECTIVE: The experience sampling method (ESM) has been frequently used in 
clinical research; however, there is low translational uptake in clinical 
practice. This may be due to challenges with interpreting individual-level data 
at granular intervals. We provide an illustrative example of how ESM can be 
leveraged to generate personalized cognitive-behavioral strategies for 
problematic cannabis use.
METHOD: We conducted a descriptive case series analysis using ESM data from 30 
individuals reporting on problematic cannabis use, craving, affect, and coping 
four times daily for 16-days (t = 64, T = 1,920).
RESULTS: Analyzing ESM data using descriptive statistics and visualizations from 
individuals with similar clinical and demographic profiles supported a diverse 
array of personalized clinical insights and recommendations for each case. These 
recommendations included psychoeducation regarding affect- and 
boredom-regulation strategies, functional analyses of occasions during which 
cannabis was not used, and discussions on how cannabis use intersects with one's 
personal values.
CONCLUSION: While many clinicians utilize measurement-based care, barriers have 
limited the incorporation of ESM towards personalized, data-informed approaches 
to treatment. We provide an illustrative example of how ESM data can be used to 
generate actionable treatment strategies for problematic cannabis use and 
highlight continued challenges with interpreting time-series data.

Needs for care of residents with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and 
association with daily activities and mood monitored with experience sampling 
method: the DIAPASON study.

Zarbo C(2), Rocchetti M(5), Starace F(6), Casiraghi L(5), Ruggeri M(7), de 
Girolamo G(2); DiAPASon Collaborators.

AIMS: Care needs represent an essential paradigm in planning residential 
facility (RF) interventions. However, possible disagreements between users and 
staff are critical issues in service delivery. The Experience Sampling Method 
(ESM) tracks experiences in the real world and real time. This study aimed to 
evaluate the care needs of patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD) 
in RFs and its association with daily activities and mood monitored using the 
ESM.
METHODS: As part of the DIAPASON project, 313 residents with SSD were recruited 
from 99 Italian RFs. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were 
recorded. Care needs, the severity of symptomatology and negative symptoms were 
assessed. Fifty-six residents were also assessed for 7 consecutive days using 
the mobile ESM. Descriptive, agreement, predictor and moderator analyses were 
conducted.
RESULTS: The staff rated a higher number of total and met needs than service 
users (p < 0.001). Only a slight agreement between users and staff on unmet 
needs was found in self-care (k = 0.106) and information (k = 0.100) needs, 
while a moderate agreement was found in accommodation (k = 0.484), food (k = 
0.406), childcare (k = 0.530), physical health (k = 0.470), telephone (k = 
0.458) and transport (k = 0.425) needs. Older age (-0.15; p < 0.01), longer SSD 
diagnosis (-0.16; p < 0.01), higher collaboration (-0.16; p < 0.01) and lower 
symptomatology (-0.16; p < 0.01) decreased the number of unmet needs, while 
being a female (0.27; p < 0.05) and a shorter length of stay in an RF (0.54; p < 
0.001) increased the number of unmet needs. A higher number of unmet needs was 
associated with a lower amount of time spent in leisure activities or reporting 
a positive mood: on the contrary, more unmet needs were associated with a 
greater amount of time spent in religious or non-productive activities. The 
associations between unmet needs rated by staff and users and momentary mood as 
assessed using the ESM were not moderated by the severity of symptomatology.
CONCLUSIONS: Although care needs are fundamental in planning residential 
activities aimed at recovery-oriented rehabilitation, RF interventions did not 
fully meet users' needs, and some disagreements on unmet needs between users and 
staff were reported. Further efforts are necessary to overcome Italian RF limits 
in delivering rehabilitative interventions defined by real users' needs to 
facilitate users' productivity and progress towards personal recovery.

Design and Evolution of Enhanced Peptide-Peptide Ligation for Modular 
Transglutaminase Assembly.

Keeble AH(1)(2), Wood DP(1), Howarth M(1)(2).

Robust and precise tools are needed to enhance the functionality and resilience 
of synthetic nanoarchitectures. Here, we have employed directed evolution and 
rational design to build a fast-acting molecular superglue from a bacterial 
adhesion protein. We have generated the SnoopLigase2 coupling system, a 
genetically encoded route for efficient transamidation between SnoopTag2 and 
DogTag2 peptides. Each peptide was selected for rapid reaction by phage display 
screening. The optimized set allows more than 99% completion and is compatible 
with diverse buffers, pH values, and temperatures, accelerating the reaction 
over 1000-fold. SnoopLigase2 directs a specific reaction in the mammalian 
secretory pathway, allowing covalent display on the plasma membrane. 
Transglutaminase 2 (TG2) has a network of interactions and substrates amidst the 
mammalian cell surface and extracellular matrix. We expressed a modified TG2 
with resistance to oxidative inactivation and minimal self-reactivity. 
SnoopLigase2 enables TG2 functionalization with transforming growth factor alpha 
(TGFα) in routes that would be impossible through genetic fusion. The TG2:TGFα 
conjugate retained transamidase activity, stably anchored TGFα for signal 
activation in the extracellular environment, and reprogrammed cell behavior. 
This modular toolbox should create new opportunities for molecular assembly, 
both for novel biomaterials and complex cellular environments.

Isolation of Alpha Amylase-Producing Bacteria from Local Region of Ambala and 
Production of Amylase Under Optimized Factors Using Solid-State Fermentation.

Mittal A(1), Joshi M(1), Rath SK(2), Singh D(3), Dwibedi V(4).

Enzymes are one of the most significant products produced primarily from 
microbial sources for human requirements. The purpose of this work was to 
isolate, screen, and optimize enzyme production under solid-state fermentation. 
In the present study, amylase-producing bacteria were isolated from the local 
region of Ambala. A total of six samples were taken, out of which 14 isolates 
were isolated, among which seven isolates were found to be amylase producing. 
Highest amylase yield was obtained from isolate A11, further studied for the 
production of amylase under solid substrate fermentation (SSF), and also 
optimized the conditions for increased production of amylase. The molecular and 
biochemical characterization confirmed it as a strain of Alkalihalobacillus 
clausii. It was observed that growth parameters showed a profound effect on the 
production. The bacterium produces ample amount (7.3 × 103 IU/g) of alpha 
amylase using wheat bran using OVAT (one variable at a time) approach. Further 
using RSM (Response Surface Methodology) resulted in 3.78-fold increase in alpha 
amylase production, i.e., 27.57 × 103 IU/g.

PURPOSE: Oxidative stress is known to activate tumor suppressor p53, which 
inhibits cell cycle progression and induces apoptosis. Levels of p53 in lung 
tissues from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are 
increased compared with levels in nonsmokers or smokers without emphysema. A 
polymorphism in p53 codon 72 (rs1042522) is associated with emphysematous 
changes in patients with COPD. However, whether oxidative stress in the serum is 
associated with the p53 polymorphism and disease severity in COPD patients is 
unclear.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 251 patients with a history of smoking more 
than 10 pack-years were enrolled in this study, and serum levels of derivatives 
of reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROMs), biological antioxidant potential (BAP), 
and d-ROMs/BAP ratio (oxidative stress index; OSI) were measured. The percent 
low-attenuation area (LAA%) and cross-sectional area of the erector spinae 
muscles (ESMCSA) at the Th12 level were calculated from chest high-resolution 
computed tomography images. p53 codon 72 C/G genotyping was performed using 
polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis.
RESULTS: In patients carrying the p53 GG genotype, LAA% was significantly higher 
than in those carrying the CC genotype. d-ROM levels and OSI were associated 
with COPD severity and correlated with airflow limitation and markers of muscle 
atrophy (ESMCSA and creatinine/cystatin C ratio). Associations between markers 
of oxidative stress and COPD severity were observed primarily in patients 
carrying the p53 codon 72 GG genotype.
CONCLUSION: Susceptibility to pulmonary emphysema and responses to oxidative 
stress may be affected by the p53 gene polymorphism.

Real-time Symptom Assessment in Patients With Endometriosis: Psychometric 
Evaluation of an Electronic Patient-Reported Outcome Measure, Based on the 
Experience Sampling Method.

van Barneveld E(1)(2), Lim A(1)(2), van Hanegem N(3), van Osch F(4)(5), Vork 
L(4)(6), Kruimel J(4)(6), Bongers M(1)(2)(7), Leue C(8)(9).

BACKGROUND: The experience sampling method (ESM) holds advantages over 
traditional retrospective questionnaires including a high ecological validity, 
no recall bias, the ability to assess fluctuation of symptoms, and the ability 
to analyze the temporal relationship between variables.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of an 
endometriosis-specific ESM tool.
METHODS: This is a short-term follow-up prospective study, including patients 
with premenopausal endometriosis aged ≥18 years who reported dysmenorrhea, 
chronic pelvic pain, or dyspareunia between December 2019 and November 2020. An 
ESM-based questionnaire was sent out by a smartphone application 10 times a day 
during 1 week on randomly chosen moments. Additionally, patients completed 
questionnaires concerning demographics, end-of-day pain scores, and end-of-week 
symptom scores. The psychometric evaluation included compliance, concurrent 
validity, and internal consistency.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients with endometriosis completed the study. 
Compliance for answering the ESM questions was as high as 52%. End-of-week pain 
scores were higher than ESM mean scores and showed peak reporting. ESM scores 
showed strong concurrent validity when compared with symptoms scored by the 
Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale-Irritable Bowel Syndrome, 7-item 
Generalized Anxiety Disorders Scale, 9-question Patient Health Questionnaire, 
and the majority of questions of the 30-item Endometriosis Health Profile. 
Cronbach α coefficients demonstrated a good internal consistency for abdominal 
symptoms, general somatic symptoms, and positive affect, and an excellent 
internal consistency for negative affect.
CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the validity and reliability of a newly 
developed electronic instrument for the measurement of symptoms in women with 
endometriosis, based on momentary assessments. This ESM patient-reported outcome 
measure has the advantage of providing a more detailed view on individual 
symptom patterns and offers the possibility for patients to have insight in 
their symptomatology, leading to more individualized treatment strategies that 
can improve the quality of life of women with endometriosis.

How to use experience-sampling technology to understand daily functioning: A 
practical guide for mental health professionals.

Daniëls NEM(1)(2), Verhagen SJW(1)(3), van Bokhoven MA(2), Beurskens AJ(2), 
Delespaul PAEG(1)(4).

Satisfying daily life functioning is essential in mental healthcare. Standard 
assessments focus on symptoms and are designed to detect underlying 
vulnerabilities. However, they offer insufficient insight into patterns of 
contextual variability and resilience. Consequently, interventions are planned 
using incomplete information. The experience-sampling method (ESM) is a 
structured moment-to-moment diary assessing the individual's affect, thoughts, 
perception and behaviour in the daily life context. ESM helps to understand 
variation in mental states (e.g., anxiety or sleeping problems) as adaptational 
processes in relation to contextual challenges (functional analysis). Although 
ESM has been extensively studied across psychological disorders, the adoption by 
mental health professionals and their patients remains limited because the 'how 
to' is unclear. This paper presents a practical guide for ESM application in 
routine clinical care. It integrates empirical knowledge with expert experiences 
and provides real-world examples and recommendations for successful 
implementation. The guide comprises how to engage and motivate patients and how 
to customize assessments to the patient's needs. It also includes instructions 
to interpret results and create an atmosphere of shared decision-making. 
Experience-sampling technology has merits for patients with various mental 
health complaints and across healthcare settings, although the exact use and 
implementation may vary depending on the individual case.

Optical and biological properties of MgO/ZnO nanocomposite derived via eggshell 
membrane: a bio-waste approach.

Prashanna Suvaitha S(1), Divya T(1), Sridhar P(2), Palani P(2), Venkatachalam 
K(3).

A novel synthesis of MgO/ZnO nanocomposite using a template, namely an eggshell 
membrane (ESM) was attempted. The nanocomposite was characterized by XRD, 
UV-visible, FTIR, Raman, DLS (zeta potential and particle size distribution), 
FESEM with EDX, and HRTEM analysis. The presence of periclase cubic MgO (space 
group Fm3m) and hexagonal wurtzite ZnO (space group P63mc) structures was 
verified by the XRD results. The average crystallite size of the MgO/ZnO 
nanocomposite was equal to 9.43 nm. The nanocomposite exhibited an on-set of 
absorbance close to 300 nm. From the taucs plot, the bandgap of the composite 
was calculated, and it was equal to 3.63 eV. The FTIR spectrum of the composite 
showed Mg-O stretching vibration at 455 cm-1 and that of Zn-O at 564 cm-1. The 
zeta potential and the particle size distribution of the nanocomposite were 
equal to - 35.5 mV and 176.1 nm. The FESEM images of the nanocomposite appeared 
as an aggregated honeycomb with a cubic and hexagonal structure. The EDX 
analysis showed the presence of Mg (23.65 atom%), Zn (27.95 atom%), and O (48.40 
atom%). The antibacterial and antifungal activities of the nanocomposite were 
investigated using the agar-well diffusion method. The antibacterial activity 
exhibited the highest zone of inhibition for Bacillus subtilis (25 ± 0.41 mm) 
and Shigella dysenteria (25 ± 0.19 mm), whereas the antifungal activity showed 
the highest zone of inhibition for Aspergillus terrus (27 ± 0.25 mm). The MIC 
value of the nanocomposite was equal to 9.37 (µg/mL) for all the bacteria. 
Hence, it is verified that the present MgO/ZnO nanocomposite could very well be 
used to treat bacterial and fungal infections.

Potential Role of Novel Cardiovascular Biomarkers in Pediatric Patients with 
Chronic Kidney Disease.

Abreu MAD(1), Vaz de Castro PAS(1), Moreira FRC(1), Ferreira HO(1), Simões E 
Silva AC(1)(2).

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular Disease is the leading cause of death in adult and 
pediatric patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and its pathogenesis 
involves the interaction of multiple pathways. As Inflammatory mechanisms play a 
critical role in the vascular disease of CKD pediatric patients, there are 
several biomarkers related to inflammation strongly associated with this 
comorbidity.
OBJECTIVE: This review provides available evidence on the link between several 
biomarkers and the pathophysiology of heart disease in patients with CKD.
METHODS: The data were obtained independently by the authors, who carried out a 
comprehensive and non-systematic search in PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, and SciELO 
databases. The search terms were "Chronic Kidney Disease", "Cardiovascular 
Disease", "Pediatrics", "Pathophysiology", "Mineral and Bone Disorder (MBD)", 
"Renin Angiotensin System (RAS)", "Biomarkers", "BNP", "NTproBNP", "CK-MB", 
"CXCL6", "CXCL16", "Endocan-1 (ESM-1)", "FABP3", "FABP4", h-FABP", "Oncostatin-M 
(OSM)", "Placental Growth Factor (PlGF)" and "Troponin I".
RESULTS: The pathogenesis of CKD-mediated cardiovascular disease is linked to 
inflammatory biomarkers, which play a critical role in the initiation, 
maintenance, and progression of cardiovascular disease. There are several 
biomarkers associated with cardiovascular disease in pediatric patients, 
including BNP, NTproBNP, CK-MB, CXCL6, CXCL16, Endocan-1 (ESM-1), FABP3, FABP4, 
Oncostatin-M (OSM), Placental Growth Factor (PlGF), and Troponin I.
CONCLUSION: The pathogenesis of CKD-mediated cardiovascular disease is not 
completely understood, but it is linked to inflammatory biomarkers. Further 
studies are required to elucidate the pathophysiological and potential role of 
these novel biomarkers.

Negation detection in Dutch clinical texts: an evaluation of rule-based and 
machine learning methods.

van Es B(1)(2), Reteig LC(3), Tan SC(4), Schraagen M(5), Hemker MM(6), Arends 
SRS(7), Rios MAR(8), Haitjema S(9).

When developing models for clinical information retrieval and decision support 
systems, the discrete outcomes required for training are often missing. These 
labels need to be extracted from free text in electronic health records. For 
this extraction process one of the most important contextual properties in 
clinical text is negation, which indicates the absence of findings. We aimed to 
improve large scale extraction of labels by comparing three methods for negation 
detection in Dutch clinical notes. We used the Erasmus Medical Center Dutch 
Clinical Corpus to compare a rule-based method based on ContextD, a biLSTM model 
using MedCAT and (finetuned) RoBERTa-based models. We found that both the biLSTM 
and RoBERTa models consistently outperform the rule-based model in terms of F1 
score, precision and recall. In addition, we systematically categorized the 
classification errors for each model, which can be used to further improve model 
performance in particular applications. Combining the three models naively was 
not beneficial in terms of performance. We conclude that the biLSTM and 
RoBERTa-based models in particular are highly accurate accurate in detecting 
clinical negations, but that ultimately all three approaches can be viable 
depending on the use case at hand.

Enhanced extracellular raw starch-degrading α-amylase production in Bacillus 
subtilis by promoter engineering and translation initiation efficiency 
optimization.

Li H(#)(1)(2), Yao D(#)(1)(2), Pan Y(1)(2), Chen X(1)(2), Fang Z(3)(4), Xiao 
Y(5)(6).

BACKGROUND: A raw starch-degrading α-amylase from Pontibacillus sp. ZY (AmyZ1), 
previously screened by our laboratory, showed a promising application potential 
for starch-processing industries. However, the AmyZ1 secretory production still 
under investigation, which seriously restricts its application in the 
starch-processing industry. On the other hand, Bacillus subtilis is widely used 
to achieve the extracellular expression of target proteins.
RESULTS: AmyZ1 secretory production was achieved in B. subtilis and was enhanced 
by promoter engineering and translation initiation efficiency optimization. 
First, based on the different phase-dependent promoters, the dual-promoter 
PspoVG-PspoVG142 was constructed by combining dual-promoter engineering and 
promoter modification. The corresponding strain BZd34 showed an extracellular 
AmyZ1 activity of 1437.6 U/mL during shake flask cultivation, which was 
3.11-fold higher than that of the original strain BZ1 (PgroE). Then, based on 
translation initiation efficiency optimization, the best strain BZd343 
containing optimized 5'-proximal coding sequence (opt3) produced the highest 
extracellular α-amylase activity of 1691.1 U/mL, which was 3.65-fold higher than 
that of the strain BZ1. Finally, cultivation of BZd343 in 3-L fermenter 
exhibited an extracellular AmyZ1 activity of 14,012 U/mL at 48 h, with 
productivity of 291.9 U/mL·h.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of recombinant expression of AmyZ1 in B. 
subtilis and the expression level of AmyZ1 represents the highest raw 
starch-degrading α-amylase level in B. subtilis to date. The high-level 
expression of AmyZ1 in this work provides a foundation for its industrial 
production. The strategies used in this study also provide a strategic reference 
for improving the secretory expression of other enzymes in B. subtilis.

Improving the Catalytic Efficiency of Aspergillus fumigatus Glucoamylase toward 
Raw Starch by Engineering Its N-Glycosylation Sites and Saturation Mutation.

Song W(1)(2), Li Y(1)(2), Tong Y(3), Li Y(3), Tao J(3), Rao S(4), Li J(5), Zhou 
J(1)(2)(6), Liu S(1)(2).

Raw starch glucoamylase (RSGA) can degrade the raw starch below the starch 
gelatinization temperature. In this study, to improve the catalytic activity of 
raw corn starch, N-glycosylation was introduced into the RSGA from Aspergillus 
fumigatus through site-directed mutation and the recombinant expression in 
Komagataella phaffii. Among them, the mutants G101S (N99-L100-S101) and Q113T 
(N111-S112-T113) increased the specific activity of raw corn starch by 1.19- and 
1.21-fold, respectively. The optimal temperature of Q113T decreased from 70 to 
60 °C. Notably, the combined mutant G101S/Q113T increased the specific activity 
toward raw starch by 1.22-fold and reduced the optimal temperature from 70 to 60 
°C. Moreover, the mutant Q113M with a 1.5-fold increase in the catalytic 
activity was obtained via saturation mutation at site 113. Thus, the 
N-glycosylation site engineering is an efficient method to improve the activity 
of RSGA toward raw starch.

A novel signal amplification strategy for label-free electrochemical DNA sensor 
based on the interaction between α-cyclodextrin and ferrocenyl indicator.

Hao J(1), Wang Z(1), Li Y(1), Deng Y(1), Fan Y(2), Huang Y(3).

The synthesized ferrocene appended naphthalimide derivative (FND) exhibited 
great binding ability toward dsDNA, while its usage as the electrochemical 
hybridization indicator was restricted by the poor water solubility. Herein, a 
simple and effective signal amplification strategy for FND based label-free DNA 
biosensors was developed based on the interaction between FND and cyclodextrin. 
α-Cyclodextrin (α-CD), β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) and γ-cyclodextrin (γ-CD) were 
helpful to amplify the signal of the DNA biosensor, while the signal 
amplification effect of α-CD was better than that of β-CD and γ-CD. Under the 
optimum conditions, there was a 3-fold increase in the sensitivity of the DNA 
biosensor after the addition of α-CD. The interaction between FND and α-/β-/γ-CD 
was investigated by differential pulse voltammetry and fluorescence experiment. 
Experimental results showed that α-CD not only minimized the impact on the 
electrochemical activity of FND but also improved the dispersity of FND in 
aqueous solution. That was why the proposed biosensor showed higher sensitivity 
in the presence of α-CD. This strategy was universal for other ferrocenyl 
indicators with similar structures as used in this work.

Structural basis for different membrane-binding properties of E. coli anaerobic 
and human mitochondrial β-oxidation trifunctional enzymes.

Sah-Teli SK(1), Pinkas M(2), Hynönen MJ(1), Butcher SJ(3), Wierenga RK(1), 
Novacek J(2), Venkatesan R(4).

Facultative anaerobic bacteria such as Escherichia coli have two α2β2 
heterotetrameric trifunctional enzymes (TFE), catalyzing the last three steps of 
the β-oxidation cycle: soluble aerobic TFE (EcTFE) and membrane-associated 
anaerobic TFE (anEcTFE), closely related to the human mitochondrial TFE (HsTFE). 
The cryo-EM structure of anEcTFE and crystal structures of anEcTFE-α show that 
the overall assembly of anEcTFE and HsTFE is similar. However, their 
membrane-binding properties differ considerably. The shorter A5-H7 and H8 
regions of anEcTFE-α result in weaker α-β as well as α-membrane interactions, 
respectively. The protruding H-H region of anEcTFE-β is therefore more critical 
for membrane-association. Mutational studies also show that this region is 
important for the stability of the anEcTFE-β dimer and anEcTFE heterotetramer. 
The fatty acyl tail binding tunnel of the anEcTFE-α hydratase domain, as in 
HsTFE-α, is wider than in EcTFE-α, accommodating longer fatty acyl tails, in 
good agreement with their respective substrate specificities.

Endocan in prediabetes, diabetes, and diabetes-related complications: a 
systematic review and meta-analysis.

Khalaji A(1)(2), Behnoush AH(3)(4), Saeedian B(1), Khanmohammadi S(1)(2), Shokri 
Varniab Z(2)(5), Peiman S(6).

BACKGROUND: Diabetes is one of the chronic conditions with a high burden all 
around the world. Macrovascular and microvascular involvement are among the 
common mechanisms by which diabetes can impact patients' lives. Endocan as an 
inflammatory endothelial biomarker has been shown to increase in several 
communicable and non-communicable diseases. Herein, we aim to investigate the 
role of endocan as a biomarker in diabetes as a systematic review and 
meta-analysis.
METHODS: International databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and 
Embase were searched for relevant studies assessing blood endocan in diabetic 
patients. Estimation of the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% 
confidence interval (CI) for comparison of circulating endocan levels between 
diabetic patients and non-diabetic controls were conducted through random-effect 
meta-analysis.
RESULTS: Totally, 24 studies were included, assessing 3354 cases with a mean age 
of 57.4 ± 8.4 years. Meta-analysis indicated that serum endocan levels were 
significantly higher in diabetic patients in comparison with healthy controls 
(SMD 1.00, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.19, p-value < 0.01). Moreover, in the analysis of 
studies with only type-2 diabetes, the same result showing higher endocan was 
obtained (SMD 1.01, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.24, p-value < 0.01). Higher endocan levels 
were also reported in chronic diabetes complications such as diabetic 
retinopathy, diabetic kidney disease, and peripheral neuropathy.
CONCLUSION: Based on our study's findings, endocan levels are increased in 
diabetes, however, further studies are needed for assessing this association. In 
addition, higher endocan levels were detected in chronic complications of 
diabetes. This can help researchers and clinicians in recognizing disease 
endothelial dysfunction and potential complications.

Enzyme Activity Prediction of Sequence Variants on Novel Substrates using 
Improved Substrate Encodings and Convolutional Pooling.

Xu Z(1), Wu J(1), Song YS(2), Mahadevan R(1).

Protein engineering is currently being revolutionized by deep learning 
applications, especially through natural language processing (NLP) techniques. 
It has been shown that state-of-the-art self-supervised language models trained 
on entire protein databases capture hidden contextual and structural information 
in amino acid sequences and are capable of improving sequence-to-function 
predictions. Yet, recent studies have reported that current compound-protein 
modeling approaches perform poorly on learning interactions between enzymes and 
substrates of interest within one protein family. We attribute this to low-grade 
substrate encoding methods and over-compressed sequence representations received 
by downstream predictive models. In this study, we propose a new 
substrate-encoding based on Extended Connectivity Fingerprints (ECFPs) and a 
convolutional-pooling of the sequence embeddings. Through testing on an activity 
profiling dataset of haloalkanoate dehalogenase superfamily that measures 
activities of 218 phosphatases against 168 substrates, we show substantial 
improvements in predictive performances of compound-protein interaction 
modeling. In addition, we also test the workflow on three other datasets from 
the halogenase, kinase and aminotransferase families and show that our pipeline 
achieves good performance on these datasets as well. We further demonstrate the 
utility of this downstream model architecture by showing that it achieves good 
performance with six different protein embeddings, including ESM-1b (Rives et 
al., 2021), TAPE (Rao et al., 2019), ProtBert, ProtAlbert, ProtT5, and ProtXLNet 
(Elnaggar et al., 2021). This study provides a new workflow for activity 
prediction on novel substrates that can be used to engineer new enzymes for 
sustainability applications.

Diagnostic Role of Circulating Endocan Levels in Obstructive Sleep Apnea: A 
Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

Behnoush AH(1)(2), Khalaji A(1)(2), Amirkhani N(1), Pezeshki PS(1).

Endocan, as an endothelial cell damage marker, plays role in several 
cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular diseases. This systematic review and 
meta-analysis evaluates the role of endocan as a potential diagnostic or 
prognostic biomarker for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). International databases 
including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched for relevant 
studies assessing endocan levels in OSA patients compared with healthy controls 
or within different severities or comorbidities of OSA. Random-effect 
meta-analysis was performed in order to calculate the standardized mean 
difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of serum/plasma endocan in all 
comparisons. A total of 10 studies were included in our systematic review, among 
which seven were used in meta-analysis. Meta-analysis showed that endocan levels 
were significantly higher in patients with OSA compared with healthy controls 
(SMD 1.29, 95% CI 0.64-1.93, P < .001) and this was not different between serum 
and plasma subgroups. However, there was no statistical difference between 
severe and non-severe OSA patients (SMD .64, 95% CI -.22 to 1.50, P = .147). 
Considerably, higher endocan levels in patients with OSA in comparison with 
non-OSA individuals might have clinical implications. This association warrants 
further research due to its potential use as a diagnostic and prognostic 
biomarker.

Improving yield of a recombinant biologic in a Brassica hairy root manufacturing 
process.

JP(3), Guillet M(2), Cardon F(2), Ritala A(1).

Hairy root systems have proven to be a viable alternative for recombinant 
protein production. For recalcitrant proteins, maximizing the productivity of 
hairy root cultures is essential. The aim of this study was to optimize a 
Brassica rapa rapa hairy root process for secretion of alpha- l-iduronidase 
(IDUA), a biologic of medical value. The process was first optimized with hairy 
roots expressing eGFP. For the biomass optimization, the highest biomass yields 
were achieved in modified Gamborg B5 culture medium. For the secretion 
induction, the optimized secretion media was obtained with additives (1.5 g/l 
PVP + 1 mg/l 2,4- d + 20.5 g/l KNO3 ) resulting in 3.4 fold eGFP secretion when 
compared to the non-induced control. These optimized conditions were applied to 
the IDUA-expressing hairy root clone, confirming that the highest yields of 
secreted IDUA occurred when using the defined additive combination. The 
functionality of the IDUA protein, secreted and intracellular, was confirmed 
with an enzymatic activity assay. A > 150-fold increase of the IDUA activity was 
observed using an optimized secretion medium, compared with a non-induced 
medium. We have proven that our B. rapa rapa hairy root system can be harnessed 
to secrete recalcitrant proteins, illustrating the high potential of hairy roots 
in plant molecular farming.

Do loneliness and social exclusion breed paranoia? An experience sampling 
investigation across the psychosis continuum.

Bell V(1), Velthorst E(2), Almansa J(3), Myin-Germeys I(4), Shergill S(1)(5)(6), 
Fett AK(1)(3).

BACKGROUND: The role of loneliness and social exclusion in the development of 
paranoia is largely unexplored. Negative affect may mediate potential 
associations between these factors. We investigated the temporal relationships 
of daily-life loneliness, felt social exclusion, negative affect, and paranoia 
across the psychosis continuum.
METHOD: Seventy-five participants, including 29 individuals with a diagnosis of 
non-affective psychosis, 20 first-degree relatives, and 26 controls used an 
Experience Sampling Method (ESM) app to capture the fluctuations in loneliness, 
feelings of social exclusion, paranoia, and negative affect across a 1-week 
period. Data were analysed with multilevel regression analyses.
RESULTS: In all groups, loneliness and feelings of social exclusion were 
independent predictors of paranoia over time (b = 0.05, p < .001 and b = 0.04, 
p < .05, respectively). Negative affect predicted paranoia (b = 0.17, p < .001) 
and partially mediated the associations between loneliness, social exclusion, 
and paranoia. It also predicted loneliness (b = 0.15, p < .0001), but not social 
exclusion (b = 0.04, p = .21) over time. Paranoia predicted social exclusion 
over time, with more pronounced effects in controls (b = 0.43) than patients 
(b = 0.19; relatives: b = 0.17); but not loneliness (b = 0.08, p = .16).
CONCLUSION: Paranoia and negative affect worsen in all groups following feelings 
of loneliness and social exclusion. This highlights the importance of a sense of 
belonging and being included for mental well-being. Loneliness, feeling socially 
excluded, and negative affect were independent predictors of paranoid thinking, 
suggesting they represent useful targets in its treatment.

Prevalence of Chiari malformation type 1 is increased in 
pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1A and associated with aberrant bone development.

Krishnan N(1)(2), McMullan P(1)(3), Yang Q(1)(3), Buscarello AN(2), Germain-Lee 
EL(1)(2)(3).

BACKGROUND: Albright hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO) is caused by heterozygous 
inactivating mutations in GNAS. Patients with maternally-inherited mutations 
develop pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1A (PHP1A) with multi-hormone resistance 
and aberrant craniofacial and skeletal development among other abnormalities. 
Chiari malformation type 1 (CM1), a condition in which brain tissue extends into 
the spinal canal when the skull is too small, has been reported in isolated 
cases of PHP1A. It has been hypothesized to be associated with growth hormone 
(GH) deficiency. Given the adverse clinical sequelae that can occur if CM1 goes 
unrecognized, we investigated the previously undetermined prevalence of CM1, as 
well as any potential correlations with GH status, given the known increased 
prevalence of GH deficiency in PHP1A. We also investigated these metrics for low 
lying cerebellar tonsils (LLCT), defined as tonsillar descent less than 5 mm 
below the foramen magnum. In addition, we investigated possible correlations of 
CM1/LLCT with advanced hand/wrist bone ages and craniofacial abnormalities known 
to occur in PHP1A to determine whether premature chondrocyte differentiation 
and/or aberrant craniofacial development could be potential etiologies of 
CM1/LLCT through both human studies and investigations of our AHO mouse model.
METHODS: We examined patients with PHP1A in our clinic and noticed CM1 more 
frequently than expected. Therefore, we set out to determine the true prevalence 
of CM1 and LLCT in a cohort of 54 mutation-confirmed PHP1A participants who had 
clinically-indicated brain imaging. We examined potential correlations with GH 
status, clinical features, biological sex, genotype, and hand/wrist bone age 
determinations. In addition, we investigated the craniofacial development in our 
mouse model of AHO (Gnas E1+/-m) by histologic analyses, dynamic 
histomorphometry, and micro-computerized tomographic imaging (MCT) in order to 
determine potential etiologies of CM1/LLCT in PHP1A.
RESULTS: In our cohort of PHP1A, the prevalence of CM1 is 10.8%, which is at 
least 10-fold higher than in the general population. If LLCT is included, the 
prevalence increases to 21.7%. We found no correlation with GH status, 
biological sex, genotype, or hand/wrist bone age. Through investigations of our 
Gnas E1+/-m mice, the correlate to PHP1A, we identified a smaller cranial vault 
and increased cranial dome angle with evidence of hyperostosis due to increased 
osteogenesis. We also demonstrated that there was premature closure of the 
spheno-occipital synchondrosis (SOS), a cartilaginous structure essential to the 
development of the cranial base. These findings lead to craniofacial 
abnormalities and could contribute to CM1 and LLCT development in PHP1A.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of CM1 is at least 10-fold higher in PHP1A compared 
to the general population and 20-fold higher when including LLCT. This is 
independent of the GH deficiency that is found in approximately two-thirds of 
patients with PHP1A. In light of potential serious consequences of CM1, 
clinicians should have a low threshold for brain imaging. Investigations of our 
AHO mouse model revealed aberrant cranial formation including a smaller cranium, 
increased cranial dome angle, hyperostosis, and premature SOS closure rates, 
providing a potential etiology for the increased prevalence of CM1 and LLCT in 
PHP1A.

Bioactivity of Microbacterium barkeri (LMA4) In Vitro and Candidate Gene 
Annotation In Silico.

Das KK(1), Pattnaik S(2).

Actinomycetes are considered a never-ending treasure trove of biometabolites, 
which always fascinated researchers. However, to combat with newly emerging 
bacterial strains, the search for novel or analogs of existing therapeutic 
agents is recommended. In this context, this research work was carried out to 
search for a biopotent Actinomycetal strain grown in untapped soil, near the 
Hirakud dam. This Gram-positive bacteria was subjected to screening for its 
bioactivity against the medically important bacteria, isolated from local 
hospital sample using "co-culture" method, following both qualitative and 
quantitative assays. Further, the 16 s rRNA sequencing, BLASTn analysis, and GC% 
calculation were carried out. Based upon its bioactivity, a prediction-based 
genomics work was pursued, considering the gene sequence deposited in public 
domain. The reverse translation, elution of protein structural file, and the 
putative protein were predicted. The strain was identified as Microbacterium 
barkeri, with 54.1% GC content. From Gene Ontology term annotation, it was 
predicted that the α/β hydrolase fold of hydrolase protein could have been 
responsible for antibiotic/biometabolite synthesis, in silico. The in 
vitro-based sequence (from Whole Genome Sequence data) had inferred that there 
was elution of alpha/beta hydrolase fold, substantiated with conserved domain 
analysis, ORF finding more over Gene Ontology (GO) terminology annotations. The 
GO annotations had suggested that the protein had been produced in response to a 
bacteria, under the influence of external stimuli more so in stress.

Parenting and psychosis: An experience sampling methodology study investigating 
the inter-relationship between stress from parenting and positive psychotic 
symptoms.

Radley J(1), Barlow J(2), Johns LC(1).

OBJECTIVES: There is a strong association between stress and psychotic symptoms, 
and this study examined the bidirectional nature of this relationship in parents 
with psychosis, with negative affect as a mediator and a range of other 
psychosocial factors included as covariates. It also examined whether stress 
from parenting had a larger impact on psychosis than non-parenting stress.
DESIGN: The study used a within-participants repeated measures design, using 
experience sampling methodology (ESM). ESM is a self-report surveying technique 
completed over an intensive longitudinal period. Participants completed six 
surveys a day, for 10 days.
METHODS: Thirty-five participants with psychosis who were a parent to a child 
between the ages of 2 and 16 took part. Study phones alerted participants to 
complete surveys by beeping at semi-random intervals over 10 days. Multi-level 
modelling was used with surveys at Level-1 and participants at Level-2. 
Predictor variables were time-lagged in order to infer directionality.
RESULTS: Parenting stress was found to predict psychotic symptoms, and this 
relationship was mediated by negative affect. The reverse direction was also 
confirmed. Few of the additional psychosocial factors were found to have a 
significant impact on the models' estimations. Parenting stress was not found to 
have a larger impact on psychosis than other sources of stress.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides further evidence of the bidirectional 
relationship between stress and psychosis in the context of parenting. Further 
research should explore if parenting stress plays a unique role in predicting 
psychotic symptoms by comparing parents and non-parents with psychosis.

Massive release of T(H)2 cytokines induced a cytokine storm during a severe mast 
cell activation event in a patient with indolent systemic mastocytosis.

Boehm T(1), Ristl R(2), Mühlbacher J(3), Valent P(4), Wahrmann M(5), Jilma B(6).

BACKGROUND: In subjects with systemic mastocytosis, the number of mast cells is 
elevated many fold. These patients frequently experience unpredictable and 
recurrent life-threatening mast cell activation (MCA) events.
OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to analyze the derangements of chemokine and cytokine 
concentrations during severe MCA attacks.
METHODS: Samples from a patient with indolent systemic mastocytosis were used 
for this study. A total of 41 chemokines and cytokines were simultaneously 
measured in triplicate and at multiple time points during 2 severe and 2 
moderate MCA events. These were compared to 3 to 5 baseline samples, taken when 
clinical symptoms were not present.
RESULTS: During the severe MCA event, which required 2 days of treatment in the 
intensive care unit, peak chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3, IL-1ra, IL-5, IL-6, 
IL-10, IL-13, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor 
concentrations were statistically significantly elevated 29-, 99-, 44-, 280-, 
93-, 7-, and 6-fold above baseline, respectively. A highly similar pattern was 
observed during the second severe MCA event. In the moderate MCA event with 
PCR-proven influenza A infection, the TH1-associated cytokines INF-α, INF-γ, and 
TNF-α were only statistically significantly elevated 5- to 7-fold above 
baseline. The correlation coefficients between highly elevated histamine and 
cytokine concentrations during the acute phase were >95%, indicating the same 
cellular origin, possibly activated mast cells.
CONCLUSIONS: One of the severe MCA events led to life-threatening symptoms over 
several days. During this event, the massive release of TH2 cytokines induced a 
hyperinflammatory state, fulfilling published criteria for cytokine release 
syndrome. Administration of IL-6- and IL-5-inhibiting biologicals might 
significantly shorten the acute phase of severe MCA events, likely offering 
significant clinical benefits to mastocytosis patients.

Structure-free antibody paratope similarity prediction for in silico epitope 
binning via protein language models.

Ghanbarpour A(1), Jiang M(2), Foster D(1), Chai Q(1).

Antibodies are an important group of biological molecules that are used as 
therapeutics and diagnostic tools. Although millions of antibody sequences are 
available, identifying their structural and functional similarity and their 
antigen binding sites remains a challenge at large scale. Here, we present a 
fast, sequence-based computational method for antibody paratope prediction based 
on protein language models. The paratope information is then used to measure 
similarity among antibodies via protein language models. Our computational 
method enables binning of antibody discovery hits into groups as the function of 
epitope engagement. We further demonstrate the utility of the method by 
identifying antibodies targeting highly similar epitopes of the same antigens 
from a large pool of antibody sequences, using two case studies: SARS CoV2 
Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR). Our 
approach highlights the potential in accelerating antibody discovery by 
enhancing hit prioritization and diversity selection.

Ecological and Convergent Validity of Experimentally and Dynamically Assessed 
Capacity for Social Contingency Detection Using the Perceptual Crossing 
Experiment in Adolescence.

Hiekkaranta AP(1), Lecei A(1), Zapata-Fonseca L(3)(4), Lafit G(1), Fossion R(3), 
Froese T(5), Myin-Germeys I(1).

The Perceptual Crossing Experiment (PCE) captures the capacity for social 
contingency detection using real-time social interaction dynamics but has not 
been externally validated. We tested ecological and convergent validity of the 
PCE in a sample of 208 adolescents from the general population, aged 11 to 19 
years. We expected associations between PCE performance and (a) quantity and 
quality of social interaction in daily life, using Experience Sampling 
Methodology (ESM; ecological validity) and (b) self-reported social skills using 
a questionnaire (convergent validity). We also expected PCE performance to 
better explain variance in ESM social measures than self-reported social skills. 
Multilevel analyses showed that only self-reported social skills were positively 
associated with social experience of company in daily life. These initial 
results do not support ecological and convergent validity of the PCE. However, 
fueled by novel insights regarding the complexity of capturing social dynamics, 
we identified promising methodological advances for future validation efforts.

Dynamic modeling of experience sampling methodology data reveals large 
heterogeneity in biopsychosocial factors associated with persistent fatigue in 
young people living with a chronic condition.

Vroegindeweij A(1), Levelt L(2), Houtveen J(3), Van de Putte EM(4), Wulffraat 
NM(5), Swart JF(6), Nijhof SL(7).

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate associations between self-reported biopsychosocial 
factors and persistent fatigue with dynamic single-case networks.
METHODS: 31 persistently fatigued adolescents and young adults with various 
chronic conditions (aged 12 to 29 years) completed 28 days of Experience 
Sampling Methodology (ESM) with five prompts per day. ESM surveys consisted of 
eight generic and up to seven personalized biopsychosocial factors. Residual 
Dynamic Structural Equation Modeling (RDSEM) was used to analyze the data and 
derive dynamic single-case networks, controlling for circadian cycle effects, 
weekend effects, and low-frequency trends. Networks included contemporaneous and 
cross-lagged associations between biopsychosocial factors and fatigue. Network 
associations were selected for evaluation if both significant (α < 0.025) and 
relevant (β ≥ 0.20).
RESULTS: Participants chose 42 different biopsychosocial factors as personalized 
ESM items. In total, 154 fatigue associations with biopsychosocial factors were 
found. Most associations were contemporaneous (67.5%). Between chronic condition 
groups, no significant differences were observed in the associations. There were 
large inter-individual differences in which biopsychosocial factors were 
associated with fatigue. Contemporaneous and cross-lagged associations with 
fatigue varied widely in direction and strength.
CONCLUSIONS: The heterogeneity found in biopsychosocial factors associated with 
fatigue underlines that persistent fatigue stems from a complex interplay 
between biopsychosocial factors. The present findings support the need for 
personalized treatment of persistent fatigue. Discussing the dynamic networks 
with the participant can be a promising step towards tailored treatment.

State transition is quiet around pyrenoid and LHCII phosphorylation is not 
essential for thylakoid deformation in Chlamydomonas 137c.

Zhang X(1)(2), Fujita Y(1), Kaneda N(1), Tokutsu R(3), Ye S(1), Minagawa J(3), 
Shibata Y(1).

Photosynthetic organisms have developed a regulation mechanism called state 
transition (ST) to rapidly adjust the excitation balance between the two 
photosystems by light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) movement. Though many 
researchers have assumed coupling of the dynamic transformations of the 
thylakoid membrane with ST, evidence of that remains elusive. To clarify the 
above-mentioned coupling in a model organism Chlamydomonas, here we used two 
advanced microscope techniques, the excitation-spectral microscope (ESM) 
developed recently by us and the superresolution imaging based on 
structured-illumination microscopy (SIM). The ESM observation revealed 
ST-dependent spectral changes upon repeated ST inductions. Surprisingly, it 
clarified a less significant ST occurrence in the region surrounding the 
pyrenoid, which is a subcellular compartment specialized for the carbon-fixation 
reaction, than that in the other domains. Further, we found a species dependence 
of this phenomenon: 137c strain showed the significant intracellular 
inhomogeneity of ST occurrence, whereas 4A+ strain hardly did. On the other 
hand, the SIM observation resolved partially irreversible fine thylakoid 
transformations caused by the ST-inducing illumination. This fine, irreversible 
thylakoid transformation was also observed in the STT7 kinase-lacking mutant. 
This result revealed that the fine thylakoid transformation is not induced 
solely by the LHCII phosphorylation, suggesting the highly susceptible nature of 
the thylakoid ultrastructure to the photosynthetic light reactions.

I like it because it hurts you: On the association of everyday sadism, sadistic 
pleasure, and victim blaming.

Sassenrath C(1), Keller J(1), Stöckle D(1), Kesberg R(2), Nielsen YA(3), 
Pfattheicher S(3).

Past research on determinants of victim blaming mainly concentrated on 
individuals' just-world beliefs as motivational process underlying this harsh 
reaction to others' suffering. The present work provides novel insights 
regarding underlying affective processes by showing how individuals prone to 
derive pleasure from others' suffering-individuals high in everyday 
sadism-engage in victim blaming due to increased sadistic pleasure and reduced 
empathic concern they experience. Results of three cross-sectional studies and 
one ambulatory assessment study applying online experience sampling method (ESM; 
overall N = 2,653) document this association. Importantly, the relation emerged 
over and above the honesty-humility, emotionality, extraversion, agreeableness, 
conscientiousness, and openness personality model (Study 1a), and other 
so-called dark traits (Study 1b), across different cultural backgrounds (Study 
1c), and also when sampling from a population of individuals frequently 
confronted with victim-perpetrator constellations: police officers (Study 1d). 
Studies 2 and 3 highlight a significant behavioral correlate of victim blaming. 
Everyday sadism is related to reduced willingness to engage in effortful 
cognitive activity as individuals high (vs. low) in everyday sadism recall less 
information regarding victim-perpetrator constellations of sexual assault. 
Results obtained in the ESM study (Study 4) indicate that the relation of 
everyday sadism, sadistic pleasure, and victim blaming holds in everyday life 
and is not significantly moderated by interpersonal closeness to the blamed 
victim or impactfulness of the incident. Overall, the present article extends 
our understanding of what determines innocent victims' derogation and highlights 
emotional mechanisms, societal relevance, and generalizability of the observed 
associations beyond the laboratory. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all

Multiple approaches of loop region modification for thermostability improvement 
of 4,6-α-glucanotransferase from Limosilactobacillus fermentum NCC 3057.

4,6-α-glucanotransferase (4,6-α-GT), as a member of the glycoside hydrolase 70 
(GH70) family, converts starch/maltooligosaccharides into α,1-6 bond-containing 
α-glucan and possesses potential applications in food, medical and related 
industries but does not satisfy the high-temperature requirement due to its poor 
thermostability. In this study, a 4,6-α-GT (ΔGtfB) from Limosilactobacillus 
fermentum NCC 3057 was used as a model enzyme to improve its thermostability. 
The loops of ΔGtfB as the target region were optimized using directed evolution, 
sequence alignment, and computer-aided design. A total of 11 positive mutants 
were obtained and iteratively combined to obtain a combined mutant CM9, with 
high resistance to temperature (50 °C). The activity of mutant CM9 was 2.08-fold 
the activity of the wild type, accompanied by a 5 °C higher optimal temperature, 
a 5.76 °C higher melting point (Tm, 59.46 °C), and an 11.95-fold longer 
half-life time (t1/2). The results showed that most of the polar residues in the 
loop region of ΔGtfB are mutated into rigid proline residues. Molecular dynamics 
simulation demonstrated that the root mean square fluctuation of CM9 
significantly decreased by "Breathing" movement reduction of the loop region. 
This study provides a new strategy for improving the thermostability of 4,6-α-GT 
through rational loop region modification.

Understanding the Consequences of Moment-by-Moment Fluctuations in Mood and 
Social Experience for Paranoid Ideation in Psychotic Disorders.

Orth RD(1), Hur J(2), Jacome AM(1), Savage CLG(1), Grogans SE(1), Kim YH(3), 
Choe EK(3), Shackman AJ(1)(4)(5), Blanchard JJ(1).

Among individuals with psychotic disorders, paranoid ideation is common and 
associated with increased impairment, decreased quality of life, and a more 
pessimistic prognosis. Although accumulating research indicates negative affect 
is a key precipitant of paranoid ideation, the possible protective role of 
positive affect has not been examined. Further, despite the interpersonal nature 
of paranoid ideation, there are limited and inconsistent findings regarding how 
social context, perceptions, and motivation influence paranoid ideation in 
real-world contexts. In this pilot study, we used smartphone ecological 
momentary assessment to understand the relevance of hour-by-hour fluctuations in 
mood and social experience for paranoid ideation in adults with psychotic 
disorders. Multilevel modeling results indicated that greater negative affect is 
associated with higher concurrent levels of paranoid ideation and that it is 
marginally related to elevated levels of future paranoid ideation. In contrast, 
positive affect was unrelated to momentary experiences of paranoid ideation. 
More severe momentary paranoid ideation was also associated with an elevated 
desire to withdraw from social encounters, irrespective of when with familiar or 
unfamiliar others. These observations underscore the role of negative affect in 
promoting paranoid ideation and highlight the contribution of paranoid ideation 
to the motivation to socially withdraw in psychotic disorders.

Calculating Relative Correction Factors for Quantitative Analysis with 
HILIC-HPLC-ELSD Method: Eight Fructooligosaccharides of Morinda Officinalis as a 
Case Study.

Zhou L(1)(2), Ni H(2)(3), Zhang L(2), Wu W(2)(3), Zhang T(2)(4), Su Q(2)(3), 
Zhou J(2), Long H(2), Hou J(2), Gong J(1), Wu W(2).

OBJECTIVE: Because the response of evaporating light scattering detector (ELSD) 
being in a nonlinear mode, there is no consensus on the method of calculating 
its relative correction factors (RCF), which limits the application of the 
quantitative analysis for multi-components by a single marker (QAMS) with 
LC-ELSD.
METHODS: Using eight fructooligosaccharides of Morinda officinalis as a case 
study, the nystose (GF3) as a single standard was adopted to develop a QAMS 
method to simultaneously determine the other seven fructooligosaccharides with 
HILIC-HPLC-ELSD method. Six calculation methods of RCF were investigated to 
select the most reasonable method. The relative error of content between the 
QAMS and the external standard method (ESM) obtained from 30 batches of samples 
was used as an indicator to evaluate the six methods. Finally, a chemometrics 
analysis was performed to find the differential components among MO and its 
three processing products.
RESULTS: It was first reported that only one calculation method was scientific 
for calculating RCF for the LC-ELSD method. The RCFs of GF3 to the other seven 
fructooligosaccharides (GF1-GF8) were obtained as 0.86, 0.91, 0.93, 1.05, 1.15, 
1.12, and 1.18, respectively. The QAMS of eight fructooligosaccharides of 
Morinda officinalis was validated with good linearity (R 2 > 0.9998) and 
accepted the accuracy of 95-105% (RSD < 1.81%) based on nystose. Finally, 
Morinda officinalis and its three processed products were distinguished and 
could be differed based on the content of the eight fructooligosaccharides.
CONCLUSION: The scientific calculation method of RCF would be of great 
significance for developing the QAMS method in Pharmacopoeia when performing the 
LC-ELSD method.

How mood is affected by environment and upsetting events: The moderating role of 
psychological flexibility.

Villanueva J(1), Meyer AH(2), Block VJ(2), Benoy C(3), Bader K(1), Brogli S(1), 
Karekla M(4), Walter M(1), Haller E(2), Lang UE(1), Gloster AT(2).

OBJECTIVE: Patients suffering from psychological disorders report decreased 
quality of life and low mood. The relationship of these symptoms to daily 
upsetting events or environments, and in the context of active coping mechanisms 
is poorly understood. The present study thus investigates the association 
between mood, psychological flexibility, upsetting events, and environment in 
the daily life of outpatients.
METHOD: We investigated 80 outpatients at the beginning of treatment, using 
event sampling methodology (ESM). Patients' mood, occurrence of upsetting 
events, current environment, and psychological flexibility were sampled six 
times per day during a one-week intensive longitudinal examination. Data were 
analyzed using linear mixed models (LMMs).
RESULTS: Participants reported worse mood the more upsetting events they 
experienced. Further, participants reported better mood when in private 
environments (e.g., with friends), and worse mood when at the hospital, compared 
to being at home. Higher levels of psychological flexibility, however, were 
associated with better mood, irrespective of the occurrence of upsetting events 
or current environment.
CONCLUSION: Results suggest that mood is positively associated with 
psychological flexibility, not despite, but especially during the dynamic and 
context-specific challenges of daily life. Psychological flexibility may thus 
potentially act as a buffer against distress-provoking situations as patients go 
about their daily lives.

Quercetin-3-O-rutinoside from Moringa oleifera Downregulates Adipogenesis and 
Lipid Accumulation and Improves Glucose Uptake by Activation of AMPK/Glut-4 in 
3T3-L1 Cells.

Ganjayi MS(1), Karunakaran RS(1), Gandham S(2), Meriga B(1).

Natural product-based therapeutic alternatives have drawn immense interest to 
deal with growing incidence of metabolic disorders. Rutin 
(quercetin-3-O-rutinoside) is found in a variety of fruits, vegetables, and 
plant beverages. In the present study, rutin was isolated from Moringa oleifera 
Lam., leaves and its anti-lipidemic and anti-adipogenic activity was evaluated 
through inhibition of key digestive enzymes and in vitro cell culture 
experiments using 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Rutin treatment substantially reduced 
α-glucosidase and pancreatic lipase activities with IC50 values of 40 and 
35 μg/ml, respectively. MTT assay with 3T3-L1 cells demonstrated the non-toxic 
effect of rutin up to 160 μg/ml. Oil Red O-stained images of rutin-treated 
3T3-L1 cells depicted that rutin considerably reduced lipid content and 
adipogenesis (79.9%), and enhanced glycerol release in 3T3-L1 cells when 
compared to untreated cells. Rutin significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced glucose 
uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and also led to reduced levels of leptin but 
enhanced levels of adiponectin. Western blot analysis of rutin-treated 
(40 µg/ml) adipocytes showed phosphorylation of AMPK, upregulated expression of 
Glut-4 (1.31-fold) and UCP-1 (1.47-fold), but downregulated expression of PPAR-γ 
by 0.73-fold. At transcriptional level, similar trends were observed in the mRNA 
expression of the above genes, except AMPK. Our results demonstrate that rutin 
isolated from M. oleifera significantly alleviates lipid content and 
adipogenesis, and improves glucose uptake through regulating PPAR-γ and AMPK 
signaling pathways; thus, rutin can be considered as a potential therapeutic 
agent against adiposity and glucose intolerance.

Lombardy, the largest and most densely populated Italian region, was severely 
hit in February 2020 by the first pandemic wave of SARS-CoV-2 and associated 
COVID-19. Since then, additional infection waves spread in the region. The aim 
of this study was to compare the first with the subsequent waves using the 
administrative database of the Lombardy Welfare directorate. In the time frames 
of the four 2020-2022 waves, the absolute number of infected cases, sites of 
management and crude mortality rate associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity were 
extracted from the database. Infected cases progressively increased in the 
region by approximately 5-fold in the second versus the first wave, 4-fold in 
the third and 20-fold during the most recent wave mainly associated with the 
omicron variant. The crude death decreased from 18.7% in the first to 2% in the 
second and third wave to reach a 0.3% nadir at the time of the fourth wave. This 
study confirms that in Lombardy outcomes of public health and health-care 
relevance such as deaths and number of hospitalizations declined dramatically 
across the four virus waves and reached very low values in 2022 when, at 
variance with the first three SARS-CoV-2 waves, the majority of infected cases 
had been previously vaccinated.

Multistep Automated Data Labelling Procedure (MADLaP) for thyroid nodules on 
ultrasound: An artificial intelligence approach for automating image annotation.

Zhang J(1), Mazurowski MA(2), Allen BC(3), Wildman-Tobriner B(3).

Machine learning (ML) for diagnosis of thyroid nodules on ultrasound is an 
active area of research. However, ML tools require large, well-labeled datasets, 
the curation of which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. The purpose of our 
study was to develop and test a deep-learning-based tool to facilitate and 
automate the data annotation process for thyroid nodules; we named our tool 
Multistep Automated Data Labelling Procedure (MADLaP). MADLaP was designed to 
take multiple inputs including pathology reports, ultrasound images, and 
radiology reports. Using multiple step-wise 'modules' including rule-based 
natural language processing, deep-learning-based imaging segmentation, and 
optical character recognition, MADLaP automatically identified images of a 
specific thyroid nodule and correctly assigned a pathology label. The model was 
developed using a training set of 378 patients across our health system and 
tested on a separate set of 93 patients. Ground truths for both sets were 
selected by an experienced radiologist. Performance metrics including yield (how 
many labeled images the model produced) and accuracy (percentage correct) were 
measured using the test set. MADLaP achieved a yield of 63 % and an accuracy of 
83 %. The yield progressively increased as the input data moved through each 
module, while accuracy peaked part way through. Error analysis showed that 
inputs from certain examination sites had lower accuracy (40 %) than the other 
sites (90 %, 100 %). MADLaP successfully created curated datasets of labeled 
ultrasound images of thyroid nodules. While accurate, the relatively suboptimal 
yield of MADLaP exposed some challenges when trying to automatically label 
radiology images from heterogeneous sources. The complex task of image curation 
and annotation could be automated, allowing for enrichment of larger datasets 
for use in machine learning development.

Cyclopia intermedia (Honeybush) Induces Uncoupling Protein 1 and Peroxisome 
Proliferator-Activated Receptor Alpha Expression in Obese Diabetic Female db/db 
Mice.

Jack BU(1), Ramharack P(1)(2), Malherbe C(3), Gabuza K(1), Joubert E(3)(4), 
Pheiffer C(1)(5)(6).

Previously, we reported that a crude polyphenol-enriched fraction of Cyclopia 
intermedia (CPEF), a plant consumed as the herbal tea, commonly known as 
honeybush, reduced lipid content in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and inhibited body weight 
gain in obese, diabetic female leptin receptor-deficient (db/db) mice. In the 
current study, the mechanisms underlying decreased body weight gain in db/db 
mice were further elucidated using western blot analysis and in silico 
approaches. CPEF induced uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1, 3.4-fold, p < 0.05) and 
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα, 2.6-fold, p < 0.05) 
expression in brown adipose tissue. In the liver, CPEF induced PPARα expression 
(2.2-fold, p < 0.05), which was accompanied by a 31.9% decrease in fat droplets 
in Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)-stained liver sections (p < 0.001). Molecular 
docking analysis revealed that the CPEF compounds, hesperidin and neoponcirin, 
had the highest binding affinities for UCP1 and PPARα, respectively. This was 
validated with stabilising intermolecular interactions within the active sites 
of UCP1 and PPARα when complexed with these compounds. This study suggests that 
CPEF may exert its anti-obesity effects by promoting thermogenesis and fatty 
acid oxidation via inducing UCP1 and PPARα expression, and that hesperidin and 
neoponcirin may be responsible for these effects. Findings from this study could 
pave the way for designing target-specific anti-obesity therapeutics from C. 
intermedia.

TEMPROT: protein function annotation using transformers embeddings and homology 
search.

Oliveira GB(1), Pedrini H(2), Dias Z(2).

BACKGROUND: Although the development of sequencing technologies has provided a 
large number of protein sequences, the analysis of functions that each one plays 
is still difficult due to the efforts of laboratorial methods, making necessary 
the usage of computational methods to decrease this gap. As the main source of 
information available about proteins is their sequences, approaches that can use 
this information, such as classification based on the patterns of the amino 
acids and the inference based on sequence similarity using alignment tools, are 
able to predict a large collection of proteins. The methods available in the 
literature that use this type of feature can achieve good results, however, they 
present restrictions of protein length as input to their models. In this work, 
we present a new method, called TEMPROT, based on the fine-tuning and extraction 
of embeddings from an available architecture pre-trained on protein sequences. 
We also describe TEMPROT+, an ensemble between TEMPROT and BLASTp, a local 
alignment tool that analyzes sequence similarity, which improves the results of 
our former approach.
RESULTS: The evaluation of our proposed classifiers with the literature 
approaches has been conducted on our dataset, which was derived from CAFA3 
challenge database. Both TEMPROT and TEMPROT+ achieved competitive results on 
[Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], AuPRC and IAuPRC metrics on Biological 
Process (BP), Cellular Component (CC) and Molecular Function (MF) ontologies 
compared to state-of-the-art models, with the main results equal to 0.581, 0.692 
and 0.662 of [Formula: see text] on BP, CC and MF, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The comparison with the literature showed that our model presented 
competitive results compared the state-of-the-art approaches considering the 
amino acid sequence pattern recognition and homology analysis. Our model also 
presented improvements related to the input size that the model can use to train 
compared to the literature methods.

Long Non-Coding RNA Expression in Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficient Monocytes Pre- 
and Post-AAT Augmentation Therapy.

Smith SGJ(1), Greene CM(2).

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate gene expression. Their expression in 
alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency has not been investigated. Treatment of AAT 
deficiency involves infusion of plasma-purified AAT and this augmentation 
therapy has previously been shown to alter microRNA expression in monocytes of 
AAT-deficient (ZZ) individuals. Here, we assess the effect of AAT augmentation 
therapy on the lncRNA expression profile in ZZ monocytes. Peripheral blood 
monocytes were isolated from ZZ individuals pre (Day 0)- and post (Day 2)-AAT 
augmentation therapy. Arraystar lncRNA microarray profiling was performed; a 
total of 17,761 lncRNAs were detectable across all samples. The array identified 
7509 lncRNAs with differential expression post-augmentation therapy, 3084 were 
increased and 4425 were decreased (fold change ≥ 2). Expression of many of these 
lncRNAs were similarly altered in ZZ monocytes treated ex vivo with 27.5 μM AAT 
for 4 h. These properties may contribute to the manifold effects of AAT 
augmentation therapy.

How context, mood, and emotional memory interact in depression: A study in 
everyday life.

Vrijsen JN(1), Ikani N(1), Souren P(2), Rinck M(2), Tendolkar I(1), Schene 
AH(1).

Cognitive theories of depression hold that negative contextual triggers (e.g., 
stressful events) induce more negative and less positive mood, in turn 
instigating negatively biased memories. However, context-related variability in 
mood and emotional memory has received insufficient attention, while the dynamic 
interaction between these factors plays a crucial role in the kindling of new 
depressive episodes. Experience Sampling Method (ESM) for repeated, daily life 
measures of context, mood, and autobiographic emotional memory was used in 46 
currently depressed, 90 remitted-depressed, and 55 never-depressed individuals. 
Currently depressed individuals showed strongest negative processing style and 
never-depressed most positive, with remitted-depressed patients scoring 
intermediate. The moderated mediation model indicated that context appraisal had 
a direct effect on the appraisal of the recalled event (i.e., our 
operationalization of emotional memory), which was mediated by positive (but 
hardly by negative) mood and was independent of depression status. This 
mediation strength was relatively similar to the strength of the direct effect 
of context on memory. Results are in line with cognitive theories of depression. 
Especially context seems important for emotional memory. The association between 
context, mood, and memory, however, may be independent of depression status. 
Yet, the "level" of mood, context, and event appraisal does depend on depression 
status. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved).

Energy-Efficient Optimal Sensor Scheduling for State Estimation Over Multihop 
Sensor Networks.

Li Y, Zhu S, Chen C, Guan X.

In this article, we consider the power scheduling problem of the multihop 
transmission with limited power resources. For a discrete-time linear 
time-invariant process, we consider a more practical scenario where the 
forward-error-correcting (FEC) coding scheme is utilized. An approximate 
communication model is introduced to formulate the nonanalytical relationship 
between the consumption of power and the successful-decoding-probability. For 
the single-hop transmission, we propose an analytical method to figure out the 
optimal offline scheduling for the finite-time case and the optimal periodic 
schedule for the infinite-time case. We consider the process and terminal errors 
simultaneously, and explicitly discuss how different values of parameters affect 
the optimality. Moreover, we extend our conclusions to the multihop case. In 
order to deal with the difficulty and complexity brought by the multihop 
scenario, a novel method based on the equivalent-scheduling matrix (ESM) is 
proposed to describe the accumulated effects through the multihop transmission. 
Meanwhile, explicit solutions of the multihop case are provided for finite- and 
infinite-time cases, respectively. Numerical examples are provided to 
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Analysis of COVID-19 clusters involving vertical transmission in residential 
buildings in Hong Kong.

Zhao P(1).

Multiple clusters of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong have 
involved vertical transmissions in residential buildings, wherein the flats of 
confirmed cases were often vertically aligned. Data on the buildings and cases 
associated with 19 such clusters were retrieved and compared with the 
corresponding data on the entirety of Hong Kong. Vertical transmissions usually 
occurred in old high-rise buildings with small flat areas and low estate prices 
during winter. In addition, infection occurred frequently among the elderly and 
among upstairs neighbours of index cases. Virus-laden aerosols may have been 
transmitted between flats mostly via shared drainpipes, and the vertical 
distribution of the confirmed cases in a building varied by its drainage system 
design. For buildings with their entire drainpipes installed indoors, both the 
upstairs and downstairs neighbours of the index case flats could be infected. By 
comparison, buildings with their drainage stacks installed outdoors had lower 
infection risks and demonstrated a clearer pattern of vertical transmission: 
most infected cases resided upstairs from the index case flats, indicating that 
the virus spread could be dominated by the stack effect. This study provides 
valuable data and analysis for developing epidemic control strategies for 
residential buildings.

AFTGAN: prediction of multi-type PPI based on attention free transformer and 
graph attention network.

Kang Y(1), Elofsson A(2), Jiang Y(3), Huang W(4), Yu M(4), Li Z(1)(2)(4).

MOTIVATION: Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and transcriptional 
regulatory networks are critical in regulating cells and their signaling. A 
thorough understanding of PPIs can provide more insights into cellular 
physiology at normal and disease states. Although numerous methods have been 
proposed to predict PPIs, it is still challenging for interaction prediction 
between unknown proteins. In this study, a novel neural network named AFTGAN was 
constructed to predict multi-type PPIs. Regarding feature input, ESM-1b 
embedding containing much biological information for proteins was added as a 
protein sequence feature besides amino acid co-occurrence similarity and one-hot 
coding. An ensemble network was also constructed based on a transformer encoder 
containing an AFT module (performing the weight operation on vital protein 
sequence feature information) and graph attention network (extracting the 
relational features of protein pairs) for the part of the network framework.
RESULTS: The experimental results showed that the Micro-F1 of the AFTGAN based 
on three partitioning schemes (BFS, DFS and the random mode) on the SHS27K and 
SHS148K datasets was 0.685, 0.711 and 0.867, as well as 0.745, 0.819 and 0.920, 
respectively, all higher than that of other popular methods. In addition, the 
experimental comparisons confirmed the performance superiority of the proposed 
model for predicting PPIs of unknown proteins on the STRING dataset.

Soluble domains of cytochrome c-556 and Rieske iron-sulfur protein from 
Chlorobaculum tepidum: Crystal structures and interaction analysis.

Kishimoto H(1), Azai C(2), Yamamoto T(1), Mutoh R(3), Nakaniwa T(3), Tanaka 
H(3), Miyanoiri Y(3), Kurisu G(3), Oh-Oka H(1)(4).

In photosynthetic green sulfur bacteria, the electron transfer reaction from 
menaquinol:cytochrome c oxidoreductase to the P840 reaction center (RC) complex 
occurs directly without any involvement of soluble electron carrier protein(s). 
X-ray crystallography has determined the three-dimensional structures of the 
soluble domains of the CT0073 gene product and Rieske iron-sulfur protein (ISP). 
The former is a mono-heme cytochrome c with an α-absorption peak at 556 nm. The 
overall fold of the soluble domain of cytochrome c-556 (designated as cyt 
c-556sol) consists of four α-helices and is very similar to that of 
water-soluble cyt c-554 that independently functions as an electron donor to the 
P840 RC complex. However, the latter's remarkably long and flexible loop between 
the α3 and α4 helices seems to make it impossible to be a substitute for the 
former. The structure of the soluble domain of the Rieske ISP (Rieskesol 
protein) shows a typical β-sheets-dominated fold with a small cluster-binding 
and a large subdomain. The architecture of the Rieskesol protein is bilobal and 
belongs to those of b6f-type Rieske ISPs. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 
measurements revealed weak non-polar but specific interaction sites on Rieskesol 
protein when mixed with cyt c-556sol. Therefore, menaquinol:cytochrome c 
oxidoreductase in green sulfur bacteria features a Rieske/cytb complex tightly 
associated with membrane-anchored cyt c-556.

Exercise mobilizes diverse antigen specific T-cells and elevates neutralizing 
antibodies in humans with natural immunity to SARS CoV-2.

Baker FL(1)(2), Zúñiga TM(1), Smith KA(1), Batatinha H(1), Kulangara TS(1), 
Seckeler MD(3), Burgess SC(4)(5), Katsanis E(2)(5)(6)(7)(8), Simpson 
RJ(1)(2)(5)(6).

Epidemiological data suggest that physical activity protects against severe 
COVID-19 and improves clinical outcomes, but how exercise augments the 
SARS-CoV-2 viral immune response has yet to be elucidated. Here we determine the 
antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell and humoral immunity to exercise in 
non-vaccinated individuals with natural immunity to SARS CoV-2, using 
whole-blood SARS-CoV-2 peptide stimulation assays, IFN-γ ELISPOT assays, 8-color 
flow cytometry, deep T-cell receptor (TCR) β sequencing, and anti-RBD-1 
neutralizing antibody serology. We found that acute exercise reliably mobilized 
(∼2.5-fold increase) highly functional SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cells to the blood 
compartment in those with natural immunity to the virus. The mobilized cells 
reacted with spike protein (including alpha (α) and delta (δ)-variants), 
membrane, and nucleocapsid peptides in those previously infected but not in 
controls. Both groups reliably mobilized T-cells reacting with Epstein-Barr 
viral peptides. Exercise mobilized SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells maintained broad 
TCR-β diversity with no impact on CDR3 length or V and J family gene usage. 
Exercise predominantly mobilized MHC I restricted (i.e. CD8+) SARS-CoV-2 
specific T-cells that recognized ORF1ab, surface, ORF7b, nucleocapsid, and 
membrane proteins. SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies were transiently elevated 
∼1.5-fold during exercise after infection. In conclusion, we provide novel data 
on a potential mechanism by which exercise could increase SARS-CoV-2 
immunosurveillance via the mobilization and redistribution of antigen-specific 
CD8 T-cells and neutralizing antibodies. Further research is needed to define 
the tissue specific disease protective effects of exercise as SARS-CoV-2 
continues to evolve, as well as the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on this 
response.

Examining whether affectively-charged motivations predict subsequent affective 
response during physical activity: An ecological momentary assessment study.

Do B(1), Rhodes RE(2), Kanning M(3), Hewus M(1), Dunton GF(1)(4).

BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests positive affective response during physical 
activity increases the likelihood of engaging in and maintaining regular 
activity exercise in the future. Elucidating antecedents for a positive 
affective response may help identify intervention strategies to increase 
activity. Affectively-charged motivations (e.g., desires, urges, dreading) have 
been posited as proximal antecedents to physical activity but have yet to be 
examined in terms of their influence on affective response in real-world 
settings. The current study used ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to 
examine within-subject effects of pre-physical activity affectively-charged 
motivation on subsequent affective response during physical activity.
METHODS: Participants included 56 adults (M = 39.18 years, SD = 11.98; 67.86% 
female) who completed a 14-day smartphone-based EMA study. Prior to starting 
physical activity (time t), participants self-initiated an event-contingent EMA 
survey that assessed affectively-charged motivation for physical activity (i.e., 
rating scale from "dreading it" to "excited to do it"). EMA surveys prompted 
during subsequent physical activity (time t + 15 min) assessed affective 
response (i.e., feeling good-bad, energized-exhausted, thrilled-miserable, 
interested-bored, and relaxed-nervous). Multi-level linear regression models 
examined within-subject effects of pre- physical activity affectively-charged 
motivations on subsequent affective response during physical activity 
controlling for between-subjects effects of affectively-charged motivation, age, 
biological sex, time of day, and day of the week.
RESULTS: Overall, there were N = 304 physical activity occasions in the analysis 
(M = 5.43, SD = 3.97). When individuals reported more positive 
affectively-charged motivation for physical activity than usual before physical 
activity occasions, they reported feeling more energized (Estimate = 0.22, p < 
0.001), good (Estimate = 0.25, p < 0.001), thrilled (Estimate = 0.12, p = 0.02), 
and interested (Estimate = 0.24, p < 0.001) during subsequent physical activity. 
Affectively-charged motivation was not associated with feeling more relaxed 
(Estimate = 0.11, p = 0.13) during subsequent physical activity.
CONCLUSION: Momentary affectively-charged motivations predicted more positive 
affective response during subsequent physical activity among active adults. 
Future research can explore potential sources of intraindividual differences in 
affectively-charged motivations and further examine these associations with 
future physical activity behavior. To improve positive affective responses, 
interventions may boost affectively-charged motivations through real-time mobile 
prompting in naturalistic settings.

The skin delivery of tofacitinib citrate using transethosomes and hybridized 
ethosomes/nanostructured lipid carriers for vitiligo therapy: 
Dermatopharmacokinetics and in vivo assays.

Hesham H(1), Rady M(1), Hathout RM(2), Abdel-Halim M(3), Mansour S(4).

Vitiligo is an autoimmune disease where its current treatment strategies are 
lengthy in course and do not guarantee complete cure. Tofacitinib citrate (JAK 
inhibitor) is a potential cure of vitiligo through halting JAK-STAT pathway 
preventing the destruction of melanocytes. The dermato-pharmacokinetics of the 
prepared transethosomes (Et) and the hybridized ethosomes/nanostructured lipid 
carriers (Eth/NLC), namely formulations; M.E-Cr and M.E-S.M, were evaluated. In 
addition, in vivo studies on C57/BL6 vitiligo mouse model were conducted to 
confirm effectiveness of Tofacitinib citrate delivery. The results unveiled that 
the transethosomes (359.46 ± 11.82 nm) were suitable for dermal delivery while 
M.E-Cr (179.64 ± 11.16 nm), a hybrid Eth/NLC formulation, was mostly suitable 
for transdermal delivery. Nevertheless, another hybrid formulation, M.E-S.M 
(253.60 ± 14.64 nm), was apt for both dermal and transdermal delivery. The 
histopathology confirmed re-pigmentation of mice skin where formulations Et and 
M.E-S.M showed severe pigmentation compared to the control healthy and induced 
mice. On the other hand, M.E-Cr showed mild pigmentation. Immunohistochemical 
assay was performed to evaluate infiltration of CD 8+T-lymphocytes where mild 
infiltration was observed. However, the systemic IFN-γ was significantly reduced 
in case of M.E-Cr and M.E-S.M. The present work proposed potential effective 
formulations to improve the treatment of vitiligo with potential reduction in 
the total therapeutic dose, drug's side effects, and treatment costs.

Overexpression of a predicted transketolase gene and disruption of an 
α-1,3-glucan synthase gene in Aspergillus oryzae DGLA3 strain enhances the yield 
of free dihomo-γ-linolenic acid.

Tamano K(1)(2), Nakai S(3), Takayama H(1), Imai Y(4).

Free dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (DGLA), a polyunsaturated free fatty acid (FFA), 
can potentially be used to produce eicosanoid pharmaceuticals, such as 
prostaglandin E1. Previously, we constructed an Aspergillus oryzae mutant 
strain, named DGLA3, which produced free DGLA at an increased yield by faaA gene 
disruption and cooverexpression of one elongase and two desaturase genes. In 
this study, we achieved a further increase. Since FFA production is increased by 
enhancing the pentose phosphate pathway, we overexpressed a predicted 
transketolase gene composing the pathway in DGLA3, which consequently increased 
the free DGLA yield by 1.9-fold to 403 mg/L. Additionally, we disrupted the 
α-1,3-glucan synthase gene agsB involved in cell-wall biosynthesis, which 
further increased it by 1.3-fold to 533 mg/L. Overall, the yield increased by 
2.5-fold. Free DGLA productivity and biomass increased similarly, but residual 
glucose concentration decreased. Increased hyphal dispersion appeared to cause 
additional glucose consumption, resulting in an increase in biomass and yield.

Is helping you helping me? The assessment of helping others using event sampling 
methodology in a clinical and a non-clinical sample.

C(5), Hatzinger M(4), Bader K(6), Miché M(7), Lieb R(7), Meyer AH(7).

Individuals diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) and social phobia 
(SP) have difficulties in social interactions. It is unknown, however, whether 
such difficulties prevent them from helping others, thereby depriving them of 
the natural benefits of helping, such as receiving gratitude. Using event 
sampling methodology (ESM), individuals (MDD, n = 118; SP, n = 47; and control 
group, n = 119) responded to questions about the frequency of helping, in total 
at 5333 time points, and their well-being. Contrary to our hypothesis, 
individuals in the MDD, SP and control group did not differ in their helping 
frequency. Results did show an association between helping and well-being, such 
that helping is related to well-being and well-being to helping. Understanding 
the complex relation of helping others and well-being and how this might be used 
during therapy and prevention programmes are discussed.

The Effect of Parent Training Programmes on Screen Time and Social Function in 
Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.

Khoo CS(1), Ramachandram S(1).

BACKGROUND: Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are susceptible to 
excessive electronic screen media (ESM) use. This study aimed to evaluate the 
effectiveness of a parent training programme in improving the screen time and 
social functioning of children with ASD.
METHODS: This pre-/post-test quasi-experimental study involved parents by 
providing them with structured education based on the American Academy of 
Pediatrics (AAP)' screen time recommendations. In total, 259 children with ASD 
aged 3 years old-12 years old were eligible. Of those children, 26 were excluded 
due to comorbidities or taking medications. Additionally, 28 parents 
participated. Children's screen time were recorded, and social behaviour was 
scored using the Social Responsiveness Scale pre- and post-intervention.
RESULTS: There were significant reductions in the average daily screen time of 
children with ASD after their parents attended the training programme (-51.25 
min; 95% CI: -78.40, -24.10). In subgroups with reduced screen time, the 
treatment effect of the intervention was significant in improving the social 
responsiveness total score (-3.09; 95% CI: -5.96, -0.22), the social 
communication scale (-3.64; 95% CI: -5.91, -1.36) and the restricted interest 
and repetitive behaviour (RRB) scale (-5.27; 95% CI: -10.29, -0.25).
CONCLUSION: Parental training is effective in reducing screen time and improving 
social functioning in children with ASD.

Real-time detection of mean and variance changes in experience sampling data: A 
comparison of existing and novel statistical process control approaches.

Schat E(1), Tuerlinckx F(2), De Ketelaere B(3), Ceulemans E(2).

Retrospective analyses of experience sampling (ESM) data have shown that changes 
in mean and variance levels may serve as early warning signs of an imminent 
depression. Detecting such early warning signs prospectively would pave the way 
for timely intervention and prevention. The exponentially weighted moving 
average (EWMA) procedure seems a promising method to scan ESM data for the 
presence of mean changes in real-time. Based on simulation and empirical 
studies, computing and monitoring day averages using EWMA works particularly 
well. We therefore expand this idea to the detection of variance changes and 
propose to use EWMA to prospectively scan for mean changes in day variability 
statistics (i.e., [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], ln([Formula: see 
text])). When both mean and variance changes are of interest, the multivariate 
extension of EWMA (MEWMA) can be applied to both the day averages and a day 
statistic of variability. We evaluate these novel approaches to detecting 
variance changes by comparing them to EWMA-type procedures that have been 
specifically developed to detect a combination of mean and variance changes in 
the raw data: EWMA-[Formula: see text], EWMA-ln([Formula: see text]), and 
EWMA-[Formula: see text]-[Formula: see text]. We ran a simulation study to 
examine the performance of the two approaches in detecting mean, variance, or 
both types of changes. The results indicate that monitoring day statistics using 
(M)EWMA works well and outperforms EWMA-[Formula: see text] and 
EWMA-ln([Formula: see text]); the performance difference with EWMA-[Formula: see 
text]-[Formula: see text] is smaller but notable. Based on the results, we 
provide recommendations on which statistic of variability to monitor based on 
the type of change (i.e., variance increase or decrease) one expects.

Escherichia coli Protein Translation System with a User-Specified Nucleic Acid 
Sequence.

Shimizu Y(1), Tanimura N(2), Matsuura T(3).

A protein synthesis system is one of the most important and complex biological 
networks, which translates DNA-encoded information into specific functions. 
Here, ePURE_JSBML, a tool for constructing biologically relevant large-scale and 
detailed computational models based on a reconstituted cell-free protein 
synthesis system, is presented; the user can specify the mRNA sequence, initial 
component concentration, and decoding rule. Model construction is based on 
Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) using JSBML, a pure Java programming 
library. The tool generates simulation files, executable with Matlab, that 
enable a variety of simulation experiments including the synthesis of proteins 
of a few hundred residues.

Cooperativity in Photofoldamer Chloride Double Helices Turned On with Sequences 
and Solvents, Around with Guests, and Off with Light.

Lutolli A(1), Che M(1), Parks FC(1), Raghavachari K(1), Flood AH(1).

Photofoldamers are sequence-defined receptors capable of switching guest binding 
on and off. When two foldamer strands wrap around the guest into 2:1 double 
helical complexes, cooperativity emerges, and with it comes the possibility to 
switch cooperativity with light and other stimuli. We use lessons from 
nonswitchable sequence isomers of aryl-triazole foldamers to guide how to vary 
the sequence location of azobenzenes from the end (FEND) to the interior (FIN) 
and report their impact on the cooperative formation of 2:1 complexes with Cl-. 
This sequence change produces a 125-fold increase from anti-cooperative (α = 
0.008) for FEND to non-cooperative with FIN (α = 1.0). Density functional theory 
(DFT) studies show greater H-bonding and a more relaxed double helix for FIN. 
The solvent and guest complement the synthetic designs. Use of acetonitrile to 
enhance solvophobicity further enhances cooperativity in FIN (α = 126) but 
lowers the difference in cooperativity between sequences. Surprisingly, the 
impact of the sequence on cooperativity is inverted when the guest size is 
increased from Cl- (3.4 Å) to BF4- (4.1 Å). While photoconversion of interior 
azobenzenes was poor, the cis-cis isomer forms 1:1 complexes around chloride 
consistent with switching cooperativity. The effect of the guest, solvent, and 
light on the double-helix cooperativity depends on the sequence.

Reduced synergistic efficacy of piperonyl butoxide in combination with 
alpha-cypermethrin in vitro in an insecticide-resistant strain of the sheep 
blowfly, Lucilia cuprina.

Kotze AC(1), Rolls NM(2).

Control of flystrike on sheep relies on the use of insecticides. The present 
study used in vitro assays to examine the potential for increasing the efficacy 
of synthetic pyrethroids against sheep blowfly larvae using the synergist 
piperonyl butoxide (PBO). We examined the potency of alpha-cypermethrin (ACP) / 
PBO combinations against a reference insecticide-susceptible strain (LS) and a 
field-derived strain showing resistance to dicyclanil and imidacloprid. 
Co-treatment of the insecticide-susceptible strain with ACP/PBO resulted in 
increasing levels of synergism as the PBO concentration was increased, with 
synergism ratios (SRs) of up to 114-fold. Treatment with PBO/ACP combinations at 
ratios of 20:1 and 5:1 resulted in significant levels of synergism: SRs of 13.5- 
and 7.6-fold, respectively. However, the levels of synergism were significantly 
less for the insecticide-resistant strain: SRs of 4.6- and 2.6-fold for the 20:1 
and 5:1 ratios, respectively. The resistant strain showed no resistance to ACP 
when administered alone, however, was 2-fold less sensitive than the LS strain 
to the toxic effects of PBO alone. This insensitivity to PBO was removed by 
co-treatment with the P450 inhibitor aminobenzotriazole, suggesting an increased 
level of P450-mediated metabolism of the PBO in this strain compared to the LS 
strain, and hence providing a likely explanation for the reduced synergistic 
efficacy of PBO on ACP toxicity in the resistant strain. While PBO was able to 
synergise ACP with both of the blowfly strains examined here, the reduced 
synergistic efficacy observed with the field-derived insecticide-resistant 
strain lessens the potential usefulness of such a combination for blowfly 
control in the field.

Quantification of Ergot Alkaloids via Lysergic Acid Hydrazide-Development and 
Comparison of a Sum Parameter Screening Method.

Kuner M(1), Lisec J(1), Mauch T(1), Konetzki J(2), Haase H(3), Koch M(1).

Ergot alkaloids are a group of mycotoxins occurring in products derived from 
various grasses (e.g., rye) and have been regulated in the EU recently. The new 
maximum levels refer to the sum of the six most common ergot alkaloids in their 
two stereoisomeric forms in different food matrices. Typically, these twelve 
compounds are individually quantified via HPLC-MS/MS or -FLD and subsequently 
summed up to evaluate food safety in a time-consuming process. Since all these 
structures share the same ergoline backbone, we developed a novel sum parameter 
method (SPM) targeting all ergot alkaloids simultaneously via lysergic acid 
hydrazide. After extraction and clean-up, in analogy to the current European 
standard method EN 17425 (ESM) for ergot alkaloid quantitation, the samples were 
derivatized by an optimized hydrazinolysis protocol, which allowed quantitative 
conversion after 20 min at 100 °C. The new SPM was evaluated against another 
established HPLC-FLD-based method (LFGB) and the HPLC-MS/MS-based ESM using six 
naturally contaminated rye and wheat matrix reference materials. While the SPM 
provided comparable values to the ESM, LFGB showed deviating results. Determined 
recovery rates, limits of detection and quantification of all three employed 
methods confirm that the new SPM is a promising alternative to the classical 
approaches for ergot alkaloid screening in food.

Biotransformation of Tyrosol into a Novel Valuable α-Galactoside with Increased 
Solubility and Improved Anti-inflammatory Activities.

Sun T(1), Liu Y(1), Wang K(1), Duan F(1), Lu L(1).

Herein, tyrosol [2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) ethanol], which is rich in olive oil and 
red wine, was converted to a novel bioactive galactoside by enzymic 
glycosylation. The gene of α-galactosidase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus 
23 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as catalytically active 
inclusion bodies. The catalytically active inclusion bodies efficiently 
catalyzed the galactosylation of tyrosol using either melibiose or raffinose 
family oligosaccharides as glycosyl donors, resulting in a glycoside with 42.2 
or 14.2% yields. The glycoside product was purified and identified as 
p-hydroxyphenethyl α-d-galactopyranoside by mass spectrometry and NMR analyses. 
The inclusion bodies can be recycled and reused for at least 10 batch reactions 
of galactoside synthesis. Moreover, the galactoside showed 11-fold increased 
water solubility and reduced cytotoxicity as compared to tyrosol. Also, it 
exhibited higher antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activities than tyrosol 
based on lipopolysaccharide-induced activated BV2 cells. These results provided 
important insights into the application of tyrosol derivatives in functional 
foods.

The role of self-regulatory control processes in understanding aggressive 
ideations and behaviors: An experience sampling method study.

Plessen KJ(1)(2), Constanty L(1), Ranjbar S(3), Turri F(1), Miano G(1), Lepage 
C(1), Urben S(1)(2).

INTRODUCTION: In this study, we aimed to examine the association between 
aggressive ideations and aggressive behaviors in everyday life, as well as the 
role of processes related to self-regulatory control (i.e., self-control, ego 
depletion, and emotional states), using experience sampling methods (ESM).
METHODS: A total of 62 male adolescents performed a baseline measure of 
aggression, violent ideations (trait level), and ESM assessments, including four 
measures per day during nine consecutive days.
RESULTS: At a state level, aggressive ideations were associated with higher 
negative emotions during the previous day as well as with lower self-control and 
stronger anger rumination at the moment. Aggressive behaviors were related to 
higher anger rumination at the moment and to the manifestation of higher 
intensity of aggressive ideations derived in the previous measure. Higher 
self-control was related to a lower probability of aggressive behavior.
DISCUSSION: This study highlights the temporal link between aggressive ideations 
and behaviors in everyday life as well as the role of self-control in 
understanding aggressivity in the lap of time. Furthermore, we observed that 
expressions of anger (i.e., reactivity, as well as rumination) were central in 
the understanding of aggressive ideations and behaviors in the everyday life 
(i.e., at within-person variability at the state level).

A mixed-method investigation into measurement reactivity to the experience 
sampling method: The role of sampling protocol and individual characteristics.

Eisele G(1), Vachon H(1), Lafit G(1), Tuyaerts D(1), Houben M(1), Kuppens P(2), 
Myin-Germeys I(1), Viechtbauer W(1).

Since the introduction of the experience sampling method (ESM), there have been 
concerns that the repeated assessments typically related to this method may 
alter the behavior, thoughts, or feelings of participants. Previous studies have 
offered mixed results with some studies reporting reactive changes, while others 
failed to find such effects. Our aim was to investigate under which 
circumstances ESM induces reactive effects. Students (N = 151) were randomly 
assigned to receive a questionnaire containing 30 or 60 items three, six, or 
nine times per day for 14 days. A random sample of 50 participants took part in 
qualitative interviews after the end of the data collection. We investigated 
changes over time in the data, while taking into account the sampling protocol 
and characteristics of participants, and analyzed qualitative reports of 
measurement reactivity. Decreases in completion time, within-person variance of 
ratings and subjective reports of habituation point toward the existence of a 
habituation period. While participants reported increases in emotional awareness 
in interviews, ESM measures indicated a decrease in emotional awareness over 
time. Changes in behavior were rare in quantitative and qualitative reports. 
Positive affect was decreasing over time in the ESM data, and various changes in 
affect, emotion regulation, and thoughts were reported in interviews. Individual 
characteristics and sampling protocol had inconsistent effects on changes over 
time. The results suggest that ESM induces changes in within-person variability, 
completion times, affect, or emotional awareness over time. Further research is 
needed to explore whether observed changes affect the validity of ESM data.

Neural correlates of daily-life affective stress reactivity in early psychosis: 
A study combining functional MRI and experience sampling methodology.

Vaessen T(1), Reininghaus U(2), van Aubel E(3), Beijer-Klippel A(4), Steinhart 
H(3), Myin-Germeys I(3), Waltz J(5).

Affective reactivity to daily stressors are increased in individuals in the 
early stages of psychosis. Studies in psychosis patients and healthy individuals 
at increased psychosis risk show altered neural reactivity to stress in limbic 
(i.e., hippocampus [HC] and amygdala), prelimbic (i.e., ventromedial prefrontal 
cortex [vmPFC] and ventral anterior cingulate cortex [vACC]), and salience areas 
(i.e., Anterior Insula [AI]). We investigated whether a similar pattern of 
neural reactivity is present in early psychosis individuals and if brain 
activity in these regions is associated with daily-life stress reactivity. 
Twenty-nine early psychosis individuals (11 at-risk mental state and 18 
first-episode psychosis) completed the Montreal Imaging Stress Task in 
conjunction with functional MRI. The study was part of a large-scale randomized 
controlled trial on the efficacy of an acceptance and commitment therapy-based 
ecological momentary intervention for early psychosis. All participants also 
provided experience sampling methodology (ESM) data on momentary affect and 
stressful activities in their everyday environment. Multilevel regression models 
were used to estimate if daily-life stress reactivity was moderated by activity 
in (pre)limbic and salience areas. Task-induced stress was associated with 
increased activation of the right AI and decreased activation in the vmPFC, 
vACC, and HC. Task-induced changes in vmPFC and vACC activity were associated 
with affective stress reactivity, whereas changes in HC and amygdala activity 
were associated with higher overall stress ratings. These preliminary results 
suggest region-specific roles in affective and psychotic daily-life stress 
reactivity in early psychosis. The observed pattern suggests that chronic stress 
plays a role in neural stress reactivity.

Erratum in
    Geroscience. 2023 Feb 10;:

In a recent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we were able to 
demonstrate the superiority of a dietary supplement composed of essential amino 
acids (EAAs) over whey protein, in older adults with low physical function. In 
this paper, we describe the comparative plasma protein expression in the same 
subject groups of EAAs vs whey. The plasma proteomics data was generated using 
SOMA scan assay. A total of twenty proteins were found to be differentially 
expressed in both groups with a 1.5-fold change. Notably, five proteins showed a 
significantly higher fold change expression in the EAA group which included 
adenylate kinase isoenzyme 1, casein kinase II 2-alpha, Nascent 
polypeptide-associated complex subunit alpha, peroxiredoxin-1, and 
peroxiredoxin-6. These five proteins might have played a significant role in 
providing energy for the improved cardiac and muscle strength of older adults 
with LPF. On the other hand, fifteen proteins showed slightly lower fold change 
expression in the EAA group. Some of these 15 proteins regulate metabolism and 
were found to be associated with inflammation or other comorbidities. Gene 
Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed the association of these proteins with 
several biological processes. Furthermore, protein-protein interaction network 
analysis also showed distinct networks between upregulated and downregulated 
proteins. In conclusion, the important biological roles of the upregulated 
proteins plus better physical function of participants in the EAAs vs whey group 
demonstrated that EAAs have the potential to improve muscle strength and 
physical function in older adults. This study was registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03424265 "Nutritional interventions in heart failure."

First-Principles Investigation of Charged Germagraphene as a Cathode Material 
for Dual-Carbon Batteries.

Yilmaz B(1), Otani M(2), Ishihara T(3), Akbay T(1).

As part of the concerted effort for development of energy storage technologies, 
dual-ion batteries (DIBs) or dual-carbon batteries (DCBs) are attracting 
interest, owing primarily to their eco-friendly active materials. The use of 
carbon as the active materials of DCBs brings about several challenges involving 
capacity and stability. This contribution aims to provide an in-depth 
understanding of the structural and electronic properties of Ge-doped graphene 
(Germagraphene) as a novel cathode material for DCBs. Density functional theory 
(DFT) calculations are combined with the effective screening medium (ESM) method 
for analyzing the electronic and band structure of PF6 - anion-adsorbed 
Germagraphene under a potential bias. These theoretical investigations indicate 
that the use of Ge as a dopant for graphene has a positive impact on the 
adsorption of the anion on the cathode under both neutral and electrically 
biased conditions.

Modeling present and future distribution of plankton populations in a coastal 
upwelling zone: the copepod Calanus chilensis as a study case.

Rivera R(1), Escribano R(2)(3), González CE(2), Pérez-Aragón M(2)(3).

Predicting species distribution in the ocean has become a crucial task to assess 
marine ecosystem responses to ongoing climate change. In the Humboldt Current 
System (HCS), the endemic copepod Calanus chilensis is one of the key species 
bioindicator of productivity and water masses. Here we modeled the geographic 
distribution of Calanus chilensis for two bathymetric ranges, 0-200 and 
200-400 m. For the 0-200 m layer, we used the Bayesian Additive Regression Trees 
(BART) method, whereas, for the 200-400 m layer, we used the Ensembles of Small 
Models (ESMs) method and then projected the models into two future scenarios to 
assess changes in geographic distribution patterns. The models were evaluated 
using the multi-metric approach. We identified that chlorophyll-a (0.34), Mixed 
Layer Depth (0.302) and salinity (0.36) explained the distribution of C. 
chilensis. The geographic prediction of the BART model revealed a continuous 
distribution from Ecuador to the southernmost area of South America for the 
0-200 m depth range, whereas the ESM model indicated a discontinuous 
distribution with greater suitability for the coast of Chile for the 200-400 m 
depth range. A reduction of the distribution range of C. chilensis is projected 
in the future. Our study suggests that the distribution of C. chilensis is 
conditioned by productivity and mesoscale processes, with both processes closely 
related to upwelling intensity. These models serve as a tool for proposing 
indicators of changes in the ocean. We further propose that the species C. 
chilensis is a high productivity and low salinity indicator at the HCS. We 
recommend further examining multiple spatial and temporal scales for stronger 
inference.

Improved the heterodimer protein complex prediction with protein language 
models.

Chen B(1), Xie Z(2), Qiu J(3), Ye Z(4), Xu J(2), Tang J(1).

AlphaFold-Multimer has greatly improved the protein complex structure 
prediction, but its accuracy also depends on the quality of the multiple 
sequence alignment (MSA) formed by the interacting homologs (i.e. interologs) of 
the complex under prediction. Here we propose a novel method, ESMPair, that can 
identify interologs of a complex using protein language models. We show that 
ESMPair can generate better interologs than the default MSA generation method in 
AlphaFold-Multimer. Our method results in better complex structure prediction 
than AlphaFold-Multimer by a large margin (+10.7% in terms of the Top-5 best 
DockQ), especially when the predicted complex structures have low confidence. We 
further show that by combining several MSA generation methods, we may yield even 
better complex structure prediction accuracy than Alphafold-Multimer (+22% in 
terms of the Top-5 best DockQ). By systematically analyzing the impact factors 
of our algorithm we find that the diversity of MSA of interologs significantly 
affects the prediction accuracy. Moreover, we show that ESMPair performs 
particularly well on complexes in eucaryotes.

Nuancing the Limitations of Axonal Plasticity in World Health Organization Grade 
II Gliomas: White Matter Tracts Compensation Is Driven by Cortical Remodeling.

Duffau H(1)(2).

Diffuse World Health Organization grade II glioma (GIIG) is a slow-growing brain 
cancer that migrates along the white matter (WM) tracts. Neuroplastic changes 
were described in reaction to GIIG progression, opening the window to extensive 
cerebral surgical resection in patients able to resume an active life with no 
functional consequences. However, atlases of cortico-subcortical neural 
plasticity emphasized the limited potential of axonal reorganization. Yet, the 
removal of WM involved by GIIG can be possible, at least to some extent, without 
generating permanent neurological disturbances. Here, the aim was to discuss 
mechanisms underlying functional compensation which make feasible resection of 
the subcortical component of GIIG and to propose a new model of adaptative 
neural reconfiguration at the level of the axonal connectivity. In this model, 2 
parts of the WM tracts are considered: (1) the stem of the bundle that 
represents the actual limitation of plastic potential, as supported by 
reproducible behavioral disorders elicited by intraoperative axonal 
electrostimulation mapping (ESM) and (2) the terminations/origins of the bundle 
that may no longer be critical in case of functional reallocation of the cortex 
to/from which these WM fibers run-thus inducing no behavioral troubles during 
direct ESM. Understanding that a certain degree of axonal compensation in 
specific portions of the tracts is driven by cortical remodeling may enable to 
rethink the concept of WM plasticity and to refine the preoperative estimation 
of extent of resection for GIIG. Identifying eloquent fibers by ESM, especially 
their convergence in the depth, is essential to achieve an individualized 
connectome-based resection.

Stock Market Reaction to the Announcement of the COVID-19 Lockdown: Evidence 
from Healthcare Companies in Malaysia.

Xie Y(1)(2), Zhou L(3).

The sudden global pandemic of COVID-19 occurred in Malaysia at the beginning of 
new 2020, which increased the uncertainty of the economy. As a highly demanded 
industry during diseases, COVID-19-related news had a mixed influence on 
investors' confidence in the healthcare industry, so the short-term market 
reaction of the Malaysian healthcare industry is investigated during this 
unfolding event. This paper examines whether the "lockdown" suppressed the 
influence of COVID-19 pandemic on stock performance in 12 listed healthcare 
companies in Malaysia. We consider the "lockdown" order has different impacts on 
samples. The hardest hit among the four events is the first announcement of 
lockdown, whose cumulative average abnormal return (CAAR) is negative (CAAR<0), 
for its strict movement control. However, the impacts of the following three 
lockdown events are positive and less severe as the market gradually digest 
these kinds of news and the deregulation of movement control. Previous studies 
have justified the influence of disease outbreaks on the stock market; however, 
this study compensates for other studies by employing the event study 
methodology (ESM) approach to provide the first empirical evidence of the 
unprecedented influence of "lockdown" on Malaysian healthcare stock market. This 
study has practical implications for Malaysian financial markets that the 
lockdown orders matter for the Malaysian healthcare industry. The empirical 
results show that the stock market has positively affected the lockdown 
announcement after the first event. In turn, the policymakers could draw on 
these results related to stock performance to modify the regulations in the 
healthcare industry.

VR-SOAP, a modular virtual reality treatment for improving social activities and 
participation of young people with psychosis: a study protocol for a 
single-blind multi-centre randomized controlled trial.

Meins IA(1)(2)(3), Muijsson-Bouwman DC(4), Nijman SA(5)(6)(7), Greaves-Lord 
K(8), Veling W(5), Pijnenborg GHM(6)(7), van der Stouwe ECD(5).

BACKGROUND: Young people with a psychotic disorder have the same social goals as 
their healthy peers, but their social networks are smaller, they participate 
less often in leisure activities and are less successful in work and education. 
Causes of these problems are multifaceted, but culminate in difficulties with 
interacting in daily life social situations. Current treatments have only 
moderate effects on social functioning and often target one specific domain. 
Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to improve the treatment of social 
interaction difficulties. We developed a modular VR treatment for social 
functioning and participation (VR-SOAP). In this study, the effect of this 
intervention will be investigated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT).
METHODS: A total of 116 participants (age 18-40) with a DSM-5 diagnosis of 
schizophrenia spectrum or other psychotic disorder and problems with social 
functioning will be recruited from mental healthcare institutes in the 
Netherlands. Participants will be randomized to the experimental condition 
(VR-SOAP) or active VR control condition (VRelax). VR-SOAP consists of 14 
sessions and 5 modules addressing causes of impaired social functioning: four 
optional modules (1-4) and one fixed module (5). Vrelax consists of 14 sessions 
that entail psychoeducation, stress management, relaxation techniques, and the 
exploration of relaxing environments in VR. Primary outcomes are quantity and 
quality of social contacts, leisure activities and social participation, 
measured with the experience sampling method (ESM). Secondary outcomes are 
psychiatric symptoms, social behaviour, social cognition, self-esteem, 
self-stigma and paranoid thoughts. Treatment effects will be compared at 
pre-treatment (baseline), post-treatment and at 6-month follow-up.
DISCUSSION: If VR-SOAP proves to be effective, it provides therapists with a 
much-needed tool to improve social functioning of young adults with a psychotic 
disorder. Additionally, since the treatment consists of multiple modules

CgTNF-2 promotes the proliferation of haemocytes by regulating the expressions 
of CgRunx and cell cycle related genes in the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas.

L(4).

A TNF-α family member, CgTNF-2, was previously identified from the oyster 
Crassostrea gigas to involve in the antibacterial response. In the present 
study, the role of CgTNF-2 in mediating the proliferation of haemocytes was 
further explored. The mRNA expression of CgTNF-2 in granulocytes was 
significantly higher than that in semi-granulocytes and agranulocytes, and the 
percentages of CgTNF-2 antibody labeled cells in agranulocytes, 
semi-granulocytes and granulocytes were 19.15%, 40.25% and 94.07%, respectively. 
After the treatment with rCgTNF-2, the percentage of EdU+ cells in haemocytes 
increased significantly (1.77-fold, p < 0.05) at 6 h compared with that in 
rGST-treated group, and the mRNA expressions of CgRunx, CgCyclin A, CgCDK2 and 
CgCDC45 in haemocytes all increased significantly (p < 0.05), which were 
1.94-fold, 2.13-fold, 1.97-fold, 1.76-fold of that in rGST-treated group, 
respectively. Meanwhile, the protein abundance of CgRunx and CgCyclin A in the 
haemocytes of oysters in the rCgTNF-2-treated group increased, and the 
percentage of PI+ haemocytes in S phase also increased significantly (2.19-fold, 
p < 0.05) compared with that in rGST-treated group. These results collectively 
confirmed that CgTNF-2 was highly expressed in granulocytes and involved in the 
proliferation of haemocytes by regulating the expressions of CgRunx and cell 
cycle related genes in C. gigas.

Improvement in the Identification Technology for Asian Spongy Moth, Lymantria 
dispar Linnaeus, 1758 (Lepidoptera: Erebidae) Based on SS-COI.

Ji W(1), Dou F(1), Zhang C(2), Xiao Y(1), Yin W(1), Yu J(3), Kurenshchikov 
DK(4), Zhu X(3), Shi J(1).

Lymantria dispar (Linnaeus, 1758), which is commonly known as spongy moth, with 
two subspecies, is found in Asia: Lymantria dispar asiatica and Lymantria dispar 
japonica, collectively referred to as the Asian spongy moth (ASM). The 
subspecies Lymantria dispar dispar occurs in Europe and is commonly known as the 
European spongy moth (ESM). The ASM is on the quarantine list of many countries 
because it induces greater economic losses than the ESM. Accurate identification 
is essential to prevent the invasion of ASM into new areas. Although several 
techniques for identifying ASMs have been developed, the recent discovery of 
complex patterns of genetic variation among ASMs in China as well as new 
subspecies in some areas has necessitated the development of new, improved 
identification techniques, as previously developed techniques are unable to 
accurately identify ASMs from all regions in China. Here, we demonstrate the 
efficacy of an improved technique for the identification of the ASM using 
ASM-specific primers, which were designed based on cytochrome oxidase I 
sequences from samples obtained from all sites where ASMs have been documented 
to occur in China. We show that these primers are effective for identifying a 
single ASM at all life stages and from all ASM populations in China, and the 
minimum detectable concentration of genomic DNA was 30 pg. The inclusion of 
other Lymantria samples in our analysis confirmed the high specificity of the 
primers. Our improved technique allows the spread of ASMs to be monitored in 
real time and will help mitigate the spread of ASMs to other areas.

Inferring the characteristics of marine sediments from the acoustic response of 
a known, partially buried object.

Bottero A(1), Sternini S(1), Sarkar J(1), Kuperman WA(1).

We investigate the feasibility of using a known elastic target located near the 
seabed for the purpose of inferring characteristics of marine sediment. In the 
problem considered the object position and its burial depth are not known with 
precision. First, the admittance matrix of the elastic object is determined 
(numerically or experimentally) over a wide frequency range in the structural 
acoustic regime. Then, the equivalent source method (ESM) coupled with a 
spectral representation of the Green's functions in stratified domains is used 
to predict the object acoustic signature in various environments and 
experimental configurations. The resulting solver takes into account all 
multiple scattering between target (buried or not), sea floor, and sea surface 
and is not limited to short distances. After presenting the solution to the 
forward problem several synthetic inversions for sediment characteristics are 
shown. They are based upon a resonance-based misfit function we describe. The 
Bayesian procedure also infers object burial and source-object range, broadening 
its range of application.

Odor emission assessment of different WWTPs with Extended Aeration Activated 
Sludge and Rotating Biological Contactor technologies in the province of Cordoba 
(Spain).

Ruiz-Muñoz A(1), Siles JA(1), Márquez P(1), Toledo M(1), Gutiérrez MC(1), Martín 
MA(2).

In this study, five urban WWTPs (Wastewater Treatment Plant) with different 
biological treatment (Extended Aeration Activated Sludge - EAAS; Rotating 
Biological Contactor - RBC), wastewater type (Urban; Industrial) and size, were 
jointly evaluated. The aim was twofold: (1) to analyze and compare their odor 
emissions, and (2) to identify the main causes of its generation from the 
relationships between physico-chemical, respirometric and olfactometric 
variables. The results showed that facilities with EAAS technology were more 
efficient than RBC, with elimination yields of organic matter higher than 90%. 
In olfactometric terms, sludge managements facilities (SMFs) were found to be 
the critical odor source in all WWTPs compared to the Inlet point (I) or Post 
primary treatment (PP), and for seasonal periods with ambient temperature higher 
than 25 °C. Moreover, the global odor emissions quantified in all SMFs revealed 
that facilities with EAAS (C-WWTP, V-WWTP and Z-WWTP) had a lower odor 
contribution (19,345, 14,800 and 11,029 ouE/s·m2, respectively) than for those 
with RBC technology (P-WWTP and NC-WWTP) which accounted for 19,747 ouE/s·m2 and 
80,061 ouE/s·m2, respectively. In addition, chemometric analysis helped to find 
groupings and differences between the WWTPs considering the wastewater (71.27% 
of total variance explained) and sludge management (64.52% of total variance 
explained) lines independently. Finally, odor emissions were adequately 
predicted from the physico-chemical and respirometric variables in the 
wastewater (r2 = 0.8738) and sludge (r2 = 0.9373) lines, being pH, volatile 
acidity and temperature (wastewater line), and pH, moisture, temperature, SOUR 
(Specific Oxygen Uptake Rate) and OD20 (Cumulative Oxygen Demand at 20 h) 
(sludge line) the most influential variables.

Predictors of poor clinical outcomes including in-hospital death and low ability 
to perform activities of daily living at discharge in hospitalized patients with 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.

Murakami Y(1), Yasui H(2)(1), Sato J(1), Uto T(1), Inui N(3)(4), Suda T(3), 
Imokawa S(1).

BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of 
mortality and morbidity worldwide. Many patients with COPD experience 
exacerbations that require hospitalization, which is associated with an 
increased risk of in-hospital death and impaired ability to perform activities 
of daily living (ADL). Declining ability to perform ADL is a critical issue for 
these patients.
OBJECTIVES: To identify predictors of poor clinical outcomes, including 
in-hospital death and low ability to perform ADL at discharge, in patients who 
are hospitalized with exacerbation of COPD.
DESIGN: This retrospective study involved a cohort of patients with exacerbation 
of COPD who were admitted to Iwata City Hospital in Japan between July 2015 and 
October 2019.
METHODS: We collected clinical data, measured the cross-sectional area of the 
erector spinae muscles (ESMCSA) on computed tomography (CT) scans at admission, 
and investigated the associations of poor clinical outcomes (in-hospital death 
and severe dependence when performing ADL, defined as a Barthel Index (BI) of 
⩽40 at discharge) with clinical parameters.
RESULTS: Overall, 207 patients were hospitalized for exacerbation of COPD during 
the study period. The incidence of poor clinical outcomes was 21.3%, and the 
in-hospital mortality rate was 6.3%. Multivariate logistic regression analyses 
showed that older age, long-term oxygen therapy, an elevated D-dimer 
concentration, and a reduced ESMCSA on chest CT at admission were significantly 
associated with poor clinical outcomes (in-hospital death and a BI of ⩽40).
CONCLUSION: Hospitalization for exacerbation of COPD was associated with high 
rates of in-hospital mortality and a BI of ⩽40 at discharge, which may be 
predicted by assessment of ESMCSA.

Determination of Ten Flavonoids in the Raw and Fermented Fructus Aurantii by 
Quantitative Analysis of Multicomponents via a Single Marker (QAMS) Based on 
UPLC.

Yang T(1), Huang Y(1), Li Q(1), Xu Q(1), Fang Y(1), Long J(1), Huang A(1), Wang 
M(1), Xia Q(1).

Fermented Fructus Aurantii (FFA) is widely used in South China for the treatment 
of functional dyspepsia. Naringin, neohesperidin, and other flavonoids are the 
main pharmacodynamic components of FFA. A new method is presented for the 
simultaneous determination of 10 flavonoids (including flavonoid glycosides and 
aglycones) in FFA using the quantitative analysis of multicomponents via a 
single marker (QAMS) approach and is used to investigate changes in flavonoids 
during fermentation. The viability and precision of QAMS were validated against 
the ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC), with various UPLC 
instruments and chromatographic conditions being evaluated. Differences between 
raw Fructus Aurantii (RFA) and FFA were examined using orthogonal partial least 
squares discrimination analysis (OPLS-DA) and content determination. The 
influence of various fermentation conditions on flavonoids was also 
investigated. There were no appreciable differences between the QAMS and the 
external standard method (ESM), demonstrating that QAMS is an improved method 
for the determination of FA and FFA. FFA and RFA can be readily distinguished 
based on OPLS-DA chemometric modelling and the corresponding chromatograms. In 
addition, the flavonoid changes after fermentation. Fermentation considerably 
reduced the contents of flavonoid glycosides, while increasing 
hesperidin-7-O-glucoside and flavonoid aglycones. Moreover, fermentation 
conditions impact multiple flavonoids in FA, so controlling these conditions is 
necessary for the quality control of fermented FA products. This QAMS approach 
is useful for detecting numerous components in RFA and FFA simply, quickly, and 
efficiently, thus strengthening the quality control of FA and its fermented 
products.

Change Point Detection for Fine-Grained MFR Work Modes with Multi-Head 
Attention-Based Bi-LSTM Network.

Fang Y(1), Zhai Q(1), Zhang Z(2), Yang J(1).

Detection of the changes in Multi-Functional Radar (MFR) work modes is a 
critical situation assessment task for Electronic Support Measure (ESM) systems. 
There are two major challenges that must be addressed: (i) The received radar 
pulse stream may contain multiple work mode segments of unknown number and 
duration, which makes the Change Point Detection (CPD) difficult. (ii) Modern 
MFRs can produce a variety of parameter-level (fine-grained) work modes with 
complex and flexible patterns, which are challenging to detect through 
traditional statistical methods and basic learning models. To address the 
challenges, a deep learning framework is proposed for fine-grained work mode CPD 
in this paper. First, the fine-grained MFR work mode model is established. Then, 
a multi-head attention-based bi-directional long short-term memory network is 
introduced to abstract high-order relationships between successive pulses. 
Finally, temporal features are adopted to predict the probability of each pulse 
being a change point. The framework further improves the label configuration and 
the loss function of training to mitigate the label sparsity problem 
effectively. The simulation results showed that compared with existing methods, 
the proposed framework effectively improves the CPD performance at 
parameter-level. Moreover, the F1-score was increased by 4.15% under hybrid 
non-ideal conditions.

Polyproline type II helical antifreeze proteins are widespread in Collembola and 
likely originated over 400 million years ago in the Ordovician Period.

Scholl CL(1), Holmstrup M(2)(3), Graham LA(1), Davies PL(4).

Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) bind to ice crystals to prevent organisms from 
freezing. A diversity of AFP folds has been found in fish and insects, including 
alpha helices, globular proteins, and several different beta solenoids. But the 
variety of AFPs in flightless arthropods, like Collembola, has not yet been 
adequately assessed. Here, antifreeze activity was shown to be present in 18 of 
the 22 species of Collembola from cold or temperate zones. Several methods were 
used to characterize these AFPs, including isolation by ice affinity 
purification, MALDI mass spectrometry, amino acid composition analysis, tandem 
mass spectrometry sequencing, transcriptome sequencing, and bioinformatic 
investigations of sequence databases. All of these AFPs had a high glycine 
content and were predicted to have the same polyproline type II helical bundle 
fold, a fold unique to Collembola. These Hexapods arose in the Ordovician Period 
with the two orders known to produce AFPs diverging around 400 million years ago 
during the Andean-Saharan Ice Age. Therefore, it is likely that the AFP arose 
then and persisted in many lineages through the following two ice ages and 
intervening warm periods, unlike the AFPs of fish which arose independently 
during the Cenozoic Ice Age beginning ~ 30 million years ago.

Multi-objective optimization of mechanical ventilation with the aid of purifiers 
in two scenarios: Regular operation and mitigating the spread of respiratory 
infectious diseases.

Li Y(1), Fan Y(2), Zhi C(1), Ye W(1)(3), Zhang X(1).

COVID-19 and its impact on society have raised concerns about scaling up 
mechanical ventilation (MV) systems and the energy consequences. This paper 
attempted to combine MV and portable air cleaners (PACs) to achieve acceptable 
indoor air quality (IAQ) and energy reduction in two scenarios: regular 
operation and mitigating the spread of respiratory infectious diseases (RIDs). 
We proposed a multi-objective optimization method that combined the NSGA-II and 
TOPSIS techniques to determine the total equivalent ventilation rate of the 
MV-PAC system in both scenarios. The concentrations of PM2.5 and CO2 were 
primary indicators for IAQ. The modified Wells-Riley equation was adopted to 
predict RID transmissions. An open office with an MV-PAC system was used to 
demonstrate the method's applicability. Meanwhile, a field study was conducted 
to validate the method and evaluate occupants' perceptions of the MV-PAC system. 
Results showed that optimal solutions of the combined system can be obtained 
based on various IAQ requirements, seasons, outdoor conditions, etc. For regular 
operation, PACs were generally prioritized to maintain IAQ while reducing energy 
consumption even when outdoor PM2.5 concentration was high. MV can remain 
constant or be reduced at low occupancies. In RID scenarios, it is possible to 
mitigate transmissions when the quanta were < 48 h-1. No significant difference 
was found in the subjective perception of the MV and PACs. Moreover, the effects 
of infiltration on the optimal solution can be substantial. Nonetheless, our 
results suggested that an MV-PAC system can replace the MV system for offices 
for daily use and RID mitigation.

Consortium (iSMAc).

The Revised Hammersmith Scale (RHS) is a 36-item ordinal scale developed using 
clinical expertise and sound psychometrics to investigate motor function in 
participants with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). In this study, we investigate 
median change in the RHS score up to two years in paediatric SMA 2 and 3 
participants and contextualise it to the Hammersmith Functional Motor 
Scale-Expanded (HFMSE). These change scores were considered by SMA type, motor 
function, and baseline RHS score. We consider a new transitional group, spanning 
crawlers, standers, and walkers-with-assistance, and analyse that alongside 
non-sitters, sitters, and walkers. The transitional group exhibit the most 
definitive change score trend, with an average 1-year decline of 3 points. In 
the weakest patients, we are most able to detect positive change in the RHS in 
the under-5 age group, whereas in the stronger patients, we are most able to 
detect decline in the RHS in the 8-13 age group. The RHS has a reduced floor 
effect compared to the HFMSE, although we show that the RHS should be used in 
conjunction with the RULM for participants scoring less than 20 points on the 
RHS. The timed items in the RHS have high between-participant variability, so 
participants with the same RHS total can be differentiated by their timed test 
items.

Reactions from the Dark Side: How Does the Dark Tetrad Affect Responses to Daily 
Abusive Supervision Today and Tomorrow?

De Bruin R(1), Finkelstein LM(1).

Abusive supervision is a widely-studied phenomenon experienced by a multitude of 
workers across organizations and occupations. It has typically been 
conceptualized as a chronic phenomenon with negative outcomes. However, 
preliminary evidence indicates that conceptualizing abusive supervision as 
constant may not be accurate, and that its outcomes may vary temporally. This 
study uses a within-person approach to capture the dynamic nature of abusive 
supervision and subordinate responses more fully. We surveyed 102 full-time 
employees from the U.S. who responded to 932 daily surveys assessing 
personality, workplace behaviors, and justice perceptions. Daily abuse led to 
lower perceptions of justice and increased retaliation on the same day, but not 
the following days. Rather, employees who engaged in workplace deviance more 
often reported more abusive supervision, potentially as a justification for 
their behavior. Further, justice perceptions predicted increased reports of 
abuse, indicating that this may be a circular relationship instead of a 
unidirectional one. Finally, narcissism exacerbated the relationships explored. 
These results can be used to implement interventions directed at both supervisor 
behavior and subordinate perceptions and behaviors.

First Report of an α Chain Variant [Hb Coombe Park (HBA2: c.382A>G)] from India, 
Coinherited with a Novel SERPINC1 Gene Mutation: A Double Whammy?

Nair SB(1), Athalye AS(1), Panphalia M(1), Parikh FR(1).

Coinheritance of a high oxygen affinity structural hemoglobin (Hb) variant along 
with a thrombophilia marker is a rare occurrence. This may lead to a multi fold 
increase in the risk of thrombosis in patients. We report here a first case of 
Hb Coombe Park (HBA2: c.382A>G; p.Lys128Glu) from India, coinherited with a 
novel mutation (c.839C>G; p.Ser280Ter) on the SERPINC1 gene. This coinheritance 
has not been reported before. Though the patient is presently asymptomatic, 
identification of these variants will help in genetic counseling and to decide 
the future course of action in case of any clinical complications.

An investigation on information quality, media richness, and social media 
fatigue during the disruptions of COVID-19 pandemic.

Xiao H(1), Zhang Z(2), Zhang L(1).

Mobile social platforms have become a valuable information source by which users 
gain information about the COVID-19 pandemic. However, little is known about 
whether users have experienced increased daily fatigue as a result of the 
disruptions caused by pandemic. Drawing on the cognitive activation theory of 
stress (CATS), this study proposed that two typical characteristics of social 
media platforms (SMP), information quality and media richness, are associated 
with event disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic (EDC), and then induce social 
media fatigue. To address this, this study used the experience sampling method 
(ESM), collecting 550 matched cases from 110 users of the WeChat application in 
mainland China over five consecutive days. Through multilevel structural 
equation modeling (MSEM), this study discovered three main findings: (1) daily 
information quality is negatively related to event disruptions of the COVID-19 
pandemic, which in turn decreases daily social media fatigue; (2) daily media 
richness is positively associated with such event disruptions, which ultimately 
increases daily social media fatigue; (3) these effects were stronger for users 
who reported higher (vs. lower) levels of health consciousness. The implications 
of these results for the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond are discussed.

Modelling the climate change impact of mitigation (RCP 2.6) and high emission 
(RCP 8.5) scenario on maize yield and possible adaptation measures in different 
agroclimatic zones of Punjab, India.

Kothiyal S(1), Prabhjyot-Kaur(1), Sandhu SS(1), Kaur J(1).

BACKGROUND: A simulation study was performed for assessing climate change impact 
on maize under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs 2.6 and 8.5) for 
Punjab, India. The study area comprised of five agroclimatic zones (AZs) 
including seven locations. The bias corrected temperature and rainfall data from 
four models (CSIRO-Mk-3-6-0, FIO-ESM, IPSL-CM5A-MR and Ensemble) were used as 
input in CERES-Maize model which was run with constant management practices for 
two Punjab maize hybrids (PMH1 and PMH2). The maize yield for upcoming 70 years 
(2025-2095) was simulated and its deviations from the baseline (2010-2021) yield 
were computed under optimized sowing (early May to early July) and current 
sowing (end May to end June) period.
RESULTS: With current sowing dates, the maize yield declined under both RCP2.6 
and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively in all the AZs, i.e. by 4-23 and 60-80% in 
AZII, by 5-60 and 60-90% in AZIII, by 9-30 and 50-90% in AZIV and by 13-40 and 
30-90% in AZV. Though yield decline was lesser under RCP2.6 as compared to 
RCP8.5, but still it indicates that adaptive strategy such as shifting of sowing 
dates may be helpful in stabilizing the maize yield.
CONCLUSION: The results for iterative combinations of sowing period revealed 
that early June sowing in AZ II for both the hybrids, mid to end June (Ludhiana 
and Amritsar) and end May to mid June (Patiala) sowings for PMH1 were able to 
nullify the negative impact of climate change. Maize cultivation in AZIV and AZV 
would not be a suitable venture for farmers of the region. This article is

The role of the anterior insular cortex in self-monitoring: A novel study 
protocol with electrical stimulation mapping and functional magnetic resonance 
imaging.

Gomez-Andres A(1), Cunillera T(2), Rico I(3), Naval-Baudin P(4), Camins A(4), 
Fernandez-Coello A(5), Gabarrós A(5), Rodriguez-Fornells A(6).

Becoming aware of one's own states is a fundamental aspect for self-monitoring, 
allowing us to adjust our beliefs of the world to the changing context. Previous 
evidence points out to the key role of the anterior insular cortex (aIC) in 
evaluating the consequences of our own actions, especially whenever an error has 
occurred. In the present study, we propose a new multimodal protocol combining 
electrical stimulation mapping (ESM) and functional magnetic resonance imaging 
(fMRI) to explore the functional role of the aIC for self-monitoring in patients 
undergoing awake brain surgery. Our results using a modified version of the 
Stroop task tackling metacognitive abilities revealed new direct evidence of the 
involvement of the aIC in monitoring our performance, showing increased 
difficulties in detecting action-outcome mismatches when stimulating a cortical 
site located at the most posterior part of the aIC as well as significant BOLD 
activations at this region during outcome incongruences for self-made actions. 
Based on these preliminary results, we highlight the importance of assessing the 
aIC's functioning during tumor resection involving this region to evaluate 
metacognitive awareness of the self in patients undergoing awake brain surgery. 
In a similar vein, a better understanding of the aIC's role during 
self-monitoring may help shed light on action/outcome processing abnormalities 
reported in several neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, 
anosognosia for hemiplegia or major depression.

Effect of nano-delivery systems on the bioavailability and tissue 
biodistribution of vitamin E tocotrienols.

Fu JY(1), Meganathan P(2), Gunasegaran N(3), Tan DMY(4).

Vitamin E is one of the most important essential vitamins to support the 
regulation of oxidative stress in human body. Tocotrienols are part of the 
vitamin E family. The potentials of tocotrienols as nutraceutical ingredient are 
largely understated due to low oral bioavailability, which is a common problem 
associated with fat-soluble bioactive compounds. Nanoencapsulation technology 
offers innovative solutions to enhance the delivery mechanisms of these 
compounds. In this study, the effect of nanoencapsulation on the oral 
bioavailability and tissue distribution of tocotrienols were investigated using 
two types of formulations, i.e. nanovesicles (NV-T3) and solid lipid 
nanoparticles (NP-T3). At least 5-fold increment in maximum plasma 
concentrations, evident with dual-peak pharmacokinetic profiles, were observed 
after oral administration of nano-encapsulated tocotrienols. Plasma tocotrienol 
composition showed a shift from α-tocotrienol dominant in control group 
(Control-T3) to γ-tocotrienol dominant after nanoencapsulation. Tissue 
distribution of tocotrienols was found to be strongly influenced by the type of 
nanoformulation. Both nanovesicles (NV-T3) and nanoparticles (NP-T3) showed 
elevated accumulation in the kidneys and liver (5-fold) compared to control 
group while selectivity for α-tocotrienol was evident for NP-T3. In brain and 
liver of rats given NP-T3, α-tocotrienol emerged as the dominant congener 
(>80%). Acute oral administration of nanoencapsulated tocotrienols did not show 
signs of toxicity. The study concluded enhanced bioavailability and selective 
tissue accumulation of tocotrienol congeners when delivered via 
nanoencapsulation.

The use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies in people with attenuated 
psychotic symptoms - Results from a two-week diary study.

Strakeljahn F(1), Lincoln TM(2), Hennig T(3), Schlier B(2).

BACKGROUND: Prior research has shown that negative emotion constitutes a trigger 
for psychosis. This effect is further amplified by using maladaptive emotion 
regulation strategies. In contrast, the role of adaptive emotion regulation 
strategies is less clear despite its potential for informing interventions and 
prevention efforts. In this study, we investigated whether the decreased use of 
adaptive emotion regulation strategies in daily life is associated with an 
elevated risk of psychosis.
METHODS: Participants reporting a lifetime prevalence of attenuated psychotic 
symptoms (AS; n = 43) and comparison participants without attenuated psychotic 
symptoms (n = 40) completed a 14-day diary study with one daily assessment of 
adaptive emotion regulation (ER) strategies ranging from tolerance-based 
ER-strategies (e.g., understanding, constructively directing attention) to 
change-focused ER-strategies (e.g., modification, effective self-support). We 
tested for group differences in adaptive ER-strategies use with multilevel 
models.
RESULTS: AS used multiple tolerance-based adaptive ER-strategies (acceptance, 
understanding, clarity, directing attention) less frequently in daily life. 
However, only a single change-focused adaptive ER-strategy (modification) showed 
consistently lower utilization rates in AS.
CONCLUSION: People with an elevated risk of psychosis use various adaptive 
ER-strategies focusing on comprehending and accepting negative emotions less 
frequently. Fostering these strategies with targeted interventions could promote 
resilience against transitioning into psychosis.

Advanced Glycation End Products and Nitrosamines in Sausages Influenced by 
Processing Parameters, Food Additives and Fat during Thermal Processing.

Lu J(1), Li M(1), Shen M(1), Xie J(1), Xie M(1).

Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and nitrosamines (NAs) in sausage are 
associated with pathogenic and carcinogenic risks. However, the multiple 
reaction parameters affecting the production of AGEs and NAs during sausage 
processing remain unclear. This experiment evaluated the effects of processing 
parameters, food additives and fat ratios on the formation of AGEs and NAs in 
sausages. The results showed a 2-3-fold increase in Nε-(carboxymethyl)lysine 
(CML) and Nε-(carboxyethyl)lysine (CEL) when the sausage processing temperature 
was increased from 90 °C to 130 °C, and N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDEA) increased 
from 3.68 ng/g to 6.41 ng/g. The addition of salt inhibited the formation of 
AGEs and NAs, and the inhibitory ability of 2 g/100 g of salt was 63.6% for CML 
and 36.5% for N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA). The addition of 10 mg/kg nitrite to 
sausages reduced CML formation by 43.9%, however, nitrite had a significant 
contribution to the formation of NAs. The addition of fat only slightly 
contributed to the production of CML. In addition, the relationship between 
α-dicarbonyl compounds and the formation of AGEs was investigated by measuring 
the changes in α-dicarbonyl compounds in sausages. The results showed two trends 
of AGEs and α-dicarbonyl compounds: AGEs increased with the increase in 
α-dicarbonyl compounds and AGE level increased but α-dicarbonyl compound level 
decreased.

Characterization of the role of Ume6 C-terminal tail in C. albicans 
morphological plasticity.

Evans B(1), Spell E(1), Bernstein D(1).

C. albicans is an important human fungal pathogen and filamentation is essential 
for its virulence. Ume6 is a transcription factor critical for filamentation. 
Ume6 is composed of three domains, a long N terminal domain, Zn-finger domain, 
and a C-terminal domain. Previously, it was shown that the Zn-finger domain is 
essential for filamentation, as removal of this domain led to a lack of 
filamentation. However, the role for the C-terminal domain has not been defined. 
We find deletion of the C-terminal domain leads to a filamentation defect and 
the defect is not as severe as removal of the Zn-finger or ume6 deletion. We 
mutated a number of residues in the C-terminal domain to try to identify 
specific residues important for filamentation, but all of our mutants displayed 
wild type filamentation. Alpha fold predictions suggest the C-terminal domain 
forms a single alpha helix that is predicted to interact with the Zn-finger 
domain via hydrogen bond. Our data suggests the C-terminal domain binds the 
Zn-finger domain and through this interaction is important for filamentation.

Unravelling the allosteric binding mode of αD-VxXXB at nicotinic acetylcholine 
receptors.

Ho TN(1), Abraham N(1), Lewis RJ(1).

αD-conotoxins are 11 kDa homodimers that potently inhibit nicotinic 
acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) through a non-competitive (allosteric) 
mechanism. In this study, we describe the allosteric binding mode of the 
granulin-like C-terminal (CTD) of VxXXB bound to Lymnea stagnalis acetylcholine 
binding protein (Ls-AChBP), a soluble homologue of the extracellular 
ligand-binding domain of nAChRs. This co-crystal complex revealed a novel 
allosteric binding site for nAChR antagonists outside the C-loop that caps the 
orthosteric site defined by the nAChR agonist nicotine and the antagonist 
epibatidine. Mutational and docking studies on Ls-AChBP supported a two-site 
binding mode for full-length VxXXB, with the first CTD binding site located 
outside the C-loop as seen in the co-crystal complex, with a second CTD binding 
site located near the N-terminal end of the adjacent subunit of AChBP. These 
results provide new structural insight into a novel allosteric mechanism of 
nAChR inhibition and define the cooperative binding mode of the N-terminal 
domain linked granulin core domains of αD-conotoxins.

HGF and bFGF Secreted by Adipose-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Revert the 
Fibroblast Phenotype Caused by Vocal Fold Injury in a Rat Model.

Li X(1), Wang H(1), Xu W(2).

OBJECTIVE: To investigate how adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs), 
secreted hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and basic fibroblast growth factor 
(bFGF) affect the fibroblast phenotype after vocal fold injury.
METHODS: We cultured primary normal (uninjured) and injured vocal fold 
fibroblasts (VFFs). A transwell co-culture system of ADSCs and injured VFFs was 
constructed in vitro, then the effects of HGF or bFGF were inhibited. The 
proliferation, extracellular matrix (ECM) secretion and transformation of VFFs 
were observed.
RESULTS: Compared with uninjured VFFs, the secretion of collagen by injured VFFs 
increased significantly, hyaluronan synthase 1 (HAS1) secretion decreased, and 
VFF transformation increased significantly. After co-culture with ADSCs, the 
proliferation of VFFs was accelerated and the transformation was inhibited. 
Co-culture inhibited the expression of type I and III collagen and promoted the 
expression of HAS1. When HGF or bFGF secretion was inhibited, the proliferation 
of injured VFFs was inhibited. The inhibitory effect on collagen was reduced by 
both groups, but this was more obvious with the anti-HGF group. The anti-bFGF 
group had a more prominent effect on HAS1 secretion after injury than the 
anti-HGF group but the difference was not statistically significant. The 
inhibition of the transformation of injured VFFs was reduced while α-smooth 
muscle actin was upregulated, which was more obvious with the anti-HGF group.
CONCLUSIONS: ADSCs and secreted HGF and bFGF can revert the fibroblast phenotype 
caused by vocal fold injury. The effects of HGF are more significant than bFGF 
on collagen secretion and the transformation of VFFs into myofibroblasts. 
However, bFGF is more effective than HGF in upregulating HAS1.

Polymerization of the backbone of the pectic polysaccharide rhamnogalacturonan 
I.

Erratum in
    Nat Plants. 2023 Apr;9(4):673.

Rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I) is a major plant cell wall pectic polysaccharide 
defined by its repeating disaccharide backbone structure of 
[4)-α-D-GalA-(1,2)-α-L-Rha-(1,]. A family of RG-I:Rhamnosyltransferases (RRT) 
has previously been identified, but synthesis of the RG-I backbone has not been 
demonstrated in vitro because the identity of Rhamnogalacturonan 
I:Galaturonosyltransferase (RG-I:GalAT) was unknown. Here a putative 
glycosyltransferase, At1g28240/MUCI70, is shown to be an RG-I:GalAT. The name 
RGGAT1 is proposed to reflect the catalytic activity of this enzyme. When 
incubated together with the rhamnosyltransferase RRT4, the combined activities 
of RGGAT1 and RRT4 result in elongation of RG-I acceptors in vitro into a 
polymeric product. RGGAT1 is a member of a new GT family categorized as GT116, 
which does not group into existing GT-A clades and is phylogenetically distinct 
from the GALACTURONOSYLTRANSFERASE (GAUT) family of GalA transferases that 
synthesize the backbone of the pectin homogalacturonan. RGGAT1 has a predicted 
GT-A fold structure but employs a metal-independent catalytic mechanism that is 
rare among glycosyltransferases with this fold type. The identification of 
RGGAT1 and the 8-member Arabidopsis GT116 family provides a new avenue for 
studying the mechanism of RG-I synthesis and the function of RG-I in plants.

COVID-19 vaccination exacerbates ex vivo IL-6 release from isolated PBMCs.

Langgartner D(1), Winkler R(1), Brunner-Weisser J(1), Rohleder N(2), Jarczok 
MN(3), Gündel H(3), Weimer K(3), Reber SO(4).

Ex vivo culturing of isolated PBMCs from individuals vaccinated with the 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine BNT162b1 revealed a pronounced T 
cell response in the presence of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein. The latter 
was 10-fold more pronounced than the ex vivo response of PBMCs from the same 
individuals to other common pathogen T cell epitope pools, suggesting COVID-19 
vaccination to induce RBD-specific T cell responses and not to facilitate T cell 
(re)activity in general. In the current study we investigated whether COVID-19 
vaccination long-lastingly affects plasma interleukin (IL)-6 concentrations, 
complete blood counts, ex vivo IL-6 and IL-10 secretion of PBMCs cultured under 
basal conditions or in the presence of concanavalin (Con) A and 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), salivary cortisol and α-amylase, mean arterial 
pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) as well as mental and physical health status. 
The study was initially designed to investigate whether the presence vs. absence 
of own pets during urban upbringing has protective effects against psychosocial 
stress-induced immune activation during adulthood. However, as COVID-19 vaccines 
were approved while the study was ongoing and as, therefore, both vaccinated and 
non-vaccinated individuals have been recruited, we were able to stratify our 
data set with respect to the COVID-19 vaccination status and to assess the 
long-lasting effects of COVID-19 vaccination on physiological immunological, 
cardiovascular and psychosomatic health parameters. This data is presented in 
the current study. We show that isolated PBMCs from individuals vaccinated 
against COVID-19 show a ~ 600-fold increase in basal and a ~ 6000-fold increase 
in ConA-induced proinflammatory IL-6 secretion, and a ~ 2-fold increase in basal 
and ConA-induced antiinflammatory IL-10 secretion, both in comparison with 
non-vaccinated individuals. In contrast, LPS-induced ex vivo IL-6 and IL-10 
secretions were not affected by vaccination status, as were plasma IL-6 
concentrations, complete blood counts, salivary cortisol and α-amylase, 
cardiovascular measures and psychosomatic health. In summary, our findings are 
of relevance for many clinical studies ran before/during the pandemic, clearly 
indicating that consideration of participants' vaccination status is critical, 
at least when assessing ex vivo PBMC functionality.

Syndecan-4 and stromal cell-derived factor-1 alpha functionalized endovascular 
scaffold facilitates adhesion, spreading and differentiation of endothelial 
colony forming cells and functions under flow and shear stress conditions.

Wu Y(1)(2), Yazdani SK(3), Bolander JEM(4), Wagner WD(1)(2)(4).

Acellular vascular scaffolds with capture molecules have shown great promise in 
recruiting circulating endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs) to promote in 
vivo endothelialization. A microenvironment conducive to cell spreading and 
differentiation following initial cell capture are key to the eventual formation 
of a functional endothelium. In this study, syndecan-4 and stromal cell-derived 
factor-1 alpha were used to functionalize an elastomeric biomaterial composed of 
poly(glycerol sebacate), Silk Fibroin and Type I Collagen, termed PFC, to 
enhance ECFC-material interaction. Functionalized PFC (fPFC) showed 
significantly greater ECFCs capture capability under physiological flow. 
Individual cell spreading area on fPFC (1474 ± 63 μm2 ) was significantly 
greater than on PFC (1187 ± 54 μm2 ) as early as 2 h, indicating enhanced 
cell-material interaction. Moreover, fPFC significantly upregulated the 
expression of endothelial cell specific markers such as platelet endothelial 
cell adhesion molecule (24-fold) and Von Willebrand Factor (11-fold) compared 
with tissue culture plastic after 7 days, demonstrating differentiation of ECFCs 
into endothelial cells. fPFC fabricated as small diameter conduits and tested 
using a pulsatile blood flow bioreactor were stable and maintained function. The 
findings suggest that the new surface functionalization strategy proposed here 
results in an endovascular material with enhanced endothelialization.

NMR study of human macroPARPs domains: (1)H, (15)N and (13)C resonance 
assignment of hPARP14 macro domain 2 in the free and the ADPr bound state.

Fourkiotis NK(#)(1), Charalampous P(#)(1), Tsika AC(1), Kravvariti KP(1), 
Sideras-Bisdekis C(1), Gallo A(2), Spyroulias GA(3).

hPARP14 is a human ADP-ribosyl-transferase (ART) that belongs to the macroPARPs 
family, together with hPARP9 and hPARP15. It contains a tandem of three macro 
domains (MD) while each of them has different properties. The first one, namely 
MD1, has not been reported to exhibit a high binding affinity for ADP-ribose 
(ADPr) in contrast to the following two (MD2 and MD3). All three MDs exhibit an 
α/β/α sandwich-like fold as reported by the deposited crystallographic 
structures. MD2 and MD3 recognize mono-ADP-ribosylated (MARylated) but not 
poly-ADP-ribosylated (PARylated) substrates and thus they allow hPARP14 to bind 
its targets, which can be potentially MARylated by its catalytic domain (CD). 
hPARP14 participates in DNA damage repair process and immune response against 
viruses like SARS-CoV-2, which also harbors an MD fold. Furthermore, hPARP14 
like the other two macroPARPs (hPARP9 and hPARP15), is implicated in numerous 
types of cancer, such as B-aggressive lymphoma and sarcoma, rendering its MDs as 
potential important drug targets. Herein, we report the complete NMR backbone 
and side chain assignment (1H, 13C, 15N) of hPARP14 MD2 in the free and ADPr 
bound states and the NMR chemical shift-based prediction of its secondary 
structure elements. This is the first reported NMR study of a hPARP macro 
domain, paving the way to screen by NMR chemical compounds which may alter the 
ability of hPARP14 to interact with its substrates affecting its function.

[(225)Ac]Ac-SibuDAB for Targeted Alpha Therapy of Prostate Cancer: Preclinical 
Evaluation and Comparison with [(225)Ac]Ac-PSMA-617.

Busslinger SD(1), Tschan VJ(1), Richard OK(2), Talip Z(1), Schibli R(1)(3), 
Müller C(1)(3).

In the present study, SibuDAB, an albumin-binding PSMA ligand, was investigated 
in combination with actinium-225 and the data were compared with those of 
[225Ac]Ac-PSMA-617. In vitro, [225Ac]Ac-SibuDAB and [225Ac]Ac-PSMA-617 showed 
similar tumor cell uptake and PSMA-binding affinities as their 177Lu-labeled 
counterparts. The in vitro binding to serum albumin in mouse and human blood 
plasma, respectively, was 2.8-fold and 1.4-fold increased for [225Ac]Ac-SibuDAB 
as compared to [177Lu]Lu-SibuDAB. In vivo, this characteristic was reflected by 
the longer retention of [225Ac]Ac-SibuDAB in the blood than previously seen for 
[177Lu]Lu-SibuDAB. Similar to [225Ac]Ac-PSMA-617, [225Ac]Ac-SibuDAB was well 
tolerated at 30 kBq per mouse. Differences in blood cell counts were observed 
between treated mice and untreated controls, but no major variations were 
observed between values obtained for [225Ac]Ac-SibuDAB and [225Ac]Ac-PSMA-617. 
[225Ac]Ac-SibuDAB was considerably more effective to treat PSMA-positive tumor 
xenografts than [225Ac]Ac-PSMA-617. Only 5 kBq per mouse were sufficient to 
eradicate the tumors, whereas tumor regrowth was observed for mice treated with 
5 kBq [225Ac]Ac-PSMA-617 and only one out of six mice survived until the end of 
the study. The enhanced therapeutic efficacy of [225Ac]Ac-SibuDAB as compared to 
that of [225Ac]Ac-PSMA-617 and reasonable safety data qualify this novel 
radioligand as a candidate for targeted α-therapy of prostate cancer.

Zhang XL(4), Zhang J(5), Jiang CS(6).

In the present study, a series of cycloalkyl[b]thiophenylnicotinamide 
derivatives against α-glucosidase were synthesized, and evaluated for their in 
vitro and in vivo anti-diabetic potential. Most of the synthetic analogues 
exhibited superior α-glucosidase inhibitory effects than the standard drug 
acarbose (IC50 = 258.5 μM), in which compound 11b with cyclohexyl[b]thiophene 
core demonstrated the highest activity with an IC50 value of 9.9 μM and showed 
higher selectivity towards α-glucosidase over α-amylase by 7.4-fold. 
Fluorescence quenching experiment confirmed the direct binding of 11b with 
α-glucosidase, kinetics study revealed that 11b was a mixed-type inhibitor, and 
its binding mode was analyzed using molecular docking. Moreover, analogs 
compounds 6a-9b, 11b, 12b did not show in vitro cytotoxicity against LO2 and 
HepG2 cells. Finally, compound 11b exhibited in vivo hypoglycemic activity by 
reducing the blood glucose levels in sucrose-loaded rats.

the endophytic fungi Aspergillus niger from Pachysandra terminalis.

Yang T(1), Yang K(1), Zhang Y(1), Zhou R(1), Zhang F(1), Zhan G(1), Guo Z(1).

One new compound and 13 known compounds were isolated from Aspergillus niger, a 
plant endophytic fungus of Pachysandra terminalis collected from Qinling 
Mountains, Xi'an, China. The structure of new compound 1 was classically 
determined by extensive spectroscopic analysis. Compounds 5, 6, 8, and 14 were 
first reported from Aspergillus, while compound 2 was isolated from A. niger for 
the first time. All isolated compounds were further evaluated for their 
antioxidant and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities. Compounds 2 and 3 exhibited 
significant antioxidant activities with IC50 values of 31.64 μm and 24.32 μm, 
respectively, similar to the positive control ascorbic acid. Additionally, 
compound 1 displayed remarkable inhibitory activity against α-glucosidase with 
an IC50 value of 96.25 μm, which was 3.4-fold more potent than that of the 
positive control acarbose. Compound 1 has great potential for development as a 
new lead compound owing to its simple structure and remarkable biological 
activity.

Microbial engineering of Methylorubrum extorquens AM1 to enhance CO(2) 
conversion into formate.

Phan UT(1), Jeon BW(1), Kim YH(2).

Methylorubrum extorquens AM1 has the potential to consume C1 feedstock to 
produce a wide range of biomaterials, from bioplastic to pharmaceutical. 
However, the synthetic biology tools for engineering M. extorquens AM1 need to 
be employed for precise control of recombinant enzyme expression. In this study, 
we presented an approach to improve the expression level of formate 
dehydrogenase 1 from M. extorquens AM1 (MeFDH1) using an efficient terminator 
and 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) design for enhanced carbon dioxide (CO2) 
conversion activity of whole-cell biocatalyst. The rrnB terminator significantly 
increased mRNA levels of MeFDH1 alpha and beta subunits by 8.2-fold and 11-fold, 
respectively, compared to the T7 terminator. Moreover, enzyme production was 
1.6-fold higher with 2.1 mg/wet cell weight (WCW) using rrnB terminator. 
Homologous 5'-untranslated regions (5'-UTR) determined based on proteomics data 
and UTR designer also influenced the expression level of MeFDH1. The 5'-UTR of 
the formaldehyde activating enzyme (fae) was the strongest, with 2.5-fold higher 
expression than that of the control sequence (T7g-10L). Furthermore, the 
electrochemical reaction of recombinant strains as whole-cell biocatalysts was 
investigated for their applicability to CO2 conversion, showing enhanced formate 
productivity. The recombinant strain containing the 5'-UTR sequence of fae 
exhibited formate productivity of 5.0 mM/h, 2.3-fold higher than that of the 
control strain (T7). Overall, this study suggested practical applications for 
CO2 conversion into bioavailable formate and provided valuable insights for 
recombinant expression systems in methylotrophic strains.

Allosteric regulation of β-reaction stage I in tryptophan synthase upon the 
α-ligand binding.

Ito S(1), Yagi K(1), Sugita Y(1).

Tryptophan synthase (TRPS) is a bifunctional enzyme consisting of α- and 
β-subunits that catalyzes the last two steps of L-tryptophan (L-Trp) 
biosynthesis. The first stage of the reaction at the β-subunit is called 
β-reaction stage I, which converts the β-ligand from an internal aldimine 
[E(Ain)] to an α-aminoacrylate [E(A-A)] intermediate. The activity is known to 
increase 3-10-fold upon the binding of 3-indole-D-glycerol-3'-phosphate (IGP) at 
the α-subunit. The effect of α-ligand binding on β-reaction stage I at the 
distal β-active site is not well understood despite the abundant structural 
information available for TRPS. Here, we investigate the β-reaction stage I by 
carrying out minimum-energy pathway searches based on a hybrid quantum 
mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) model. The free-energy differences along 
the pathway are also examined using QM/MM umbrella sampling simulations with QM 
calculations at the B3LYP-D3/aug-cc-pVDZ level of theory. Our simulations 
suggest that the sidechain orientation of βD305 near the β-ligand likely plays 
an essential role in the allosteric regulation: a hydrogen bond is formed 
between βD305 and the β-ligand in the absence of the α-ligand, prohibiting a 
smooth rotation of the hydroxyl group in the quinonoid intermediate, whereas the 
dihedral angle rotates smoothly after the hydrogen bond is switched from 
βD305-β-ligand to βD305-βR141. This switch could occur upon the IGP-binding at 
the α-subunit, as evidenced by the existing TRPS crystal structures.

Effect of ethanolamine utilization on the pathogenicity and metabolic profile of 
enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli.

Lu X(1), Wu D(1), Zhao X(1), Zhang M(1), Ren K(1), Zhou N(1), Zhao Y(#)(2), Qian 
W(#)(3).

Bacterial pathogenicity is greatly affected by nutrient recognition and 
utilization in the host microenvironment. The characterization of enteral 
nutrients that promote intestinal pathogen virulence is helpful for developing 
new adjuvant therapies and inhibiting host damage. Ethanolamine (EA), as a major 
component of intestinal epithelial cells and bacterial membranes, is abundant in 
the intestine. Here, we provide the first demonstration that the critical human 
and porcine pathogen enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) can utilize EA as a 
nitrogen source, which affects its virulence phenotype. We found that compared 
with that in M9 medium (containing NH4Cl), EA inhibited ETEC growth to a certain 
extent; however, the relative expression levels of virulence-related genes, such 
as ltA (3.0-fold), fimH (2.9-fold), CfaD (2.6-fold), gspD (3.6-fold), and qesE 
(1.3-fold), increased significantly with 15 mM EA as a nitrogen source 
(P < 0.05), and the adhesion efficiency of ETEC to Caco-2 cells increased 
approximately 4.2-fold. In Caco-2 cells, the relative cell viability decreased 
from 74.8 to 63.4%, and the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) cells 
decreased to 74.8% with intestinal EA (4 mM). In addition, the relative 
expression levels of proinflammatory factors, such as TNF-α (3.2-fold), INF-γ 
(2.9-fold), and IL-1β (1.98-fold), in ETEC-infected Caco-2 cells were 
significantly upregulated (P < 0.05) under EA exposure; however, the above 
virulence changes were not found in ΔeutR and ΔeutB ETEC. A gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based untargeted metabolomics approach 
was then employed to reveal EA-induced metabolic reprogramming related to ETEC 
virulence. The data showed that most metabolites related to carbohydrate, 
aspartate and glutamate metabolism, shikimic acid metabolism, and serine 
metabolism in ETEC exhibited a decreasing trend with increases in the EA 
concentration from 0 to 15 mM, but the branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) levels 
in ETEC increased in a dose-dependent manner under EA exposure. Our data suggest 
that the intestinal EA concentration can significantly affect the virulence 
phenotype, metabolic profile, and pathogenicity of ETEC. KEY POINTS: • ETEC 
growth and virulence gene expression could be regulated by ethanolamine. • The 
intestinal concentration of EA promoted the damaging effect of ETEC on the host 
epithelial barrier. • The promoting effect of EA on ETEC toxicity may be related 
to BCAA metabolism.

Nanozyme-based cascade SPR signal amplification for immunosensing of nitrated 
alpha-synuclein.

Hu X(#)(1), Hu R(#)(1), Zhu H(1), Chen Q(1)(2), Lu Y(1), Chen J(1)(2), Liu 
Y(2)(3), Chen H(4).

A self-assembled nanozyme of iron porphyrin mediated supramolecular modified 
gold nanoparticles (FpA) was fabricated to determine nitrated alpha-synuclein as 
the Tyr 39 residue (nT39 α-Syn) of a potential biomarker for early diagnosis of 
Parkinson's disease (PD). Mechanically, localized surface plasmon resonance 
(LSPR) and the mass effect caused by catalytic deposition of the nanozyme 
contributed to a cascade signal amplification strategy. The sensor allowed a 
signal amplification and selective nT39 α-Syn bioanalysis with a 1.34-fold 
enhancement by cascade amplified SPR signal and double specific recognition. The 
detection limit was 1.78 ng/mL in the detection range of 7-240 ng/mL. Benefiting 
from the excellent immunosensor, this method can distinguish healthy people and 
PD patients using actual samples. Overall, this strategy provides a 
nanozyme-based biosensing platform for the early diagnosis of PD and can be 
applied to detect other protein biomarkers, such as PD-L1.

Silencing myostatin increases area fraction of smooth muscle in the corpus 
cavernosum of pigs.

Choe HM(1), Gao K(1), Paek HJ(1), Liu XY(1), Li ZY(1), Quan BH(2), Yin XJ(3).

Myostatin (MSTN), an inhibitor of skeletal muscle growth, is also expressed in 
penile smooth muscle; however, it is unclear whether MSTN plays an inhibitory 
role in penile smooth muscle growth. We investigated the role of MSTN in the 
smooth muscle of the penile corpus cavernosum of pigs using MSTN homozygous 
mutant knockout (KO) and wild type (WT) pigs (n = 4 in each group). The mean of 
area fraction (%) of smooth muscle in the penile corpus cavernosum was 
65.9 % ± 1.79 in the KO and approximately 41.7 % ± 5.39 in the WT (P < 0.001). 
KO pigs showed significantly increased expression of smooth muscle-specific 
genes, including smooth muscle protein 22 (TAGLN) (6.62-fold), smooth muscle 
myosin heavy chain (MYH11) (2.41-fold), myocardin (MYOCD) (3.05-fold), and serum 
response factor (SRF) (4.95-fold), and decreased expression of vimentin (VIM) 
(1.36-fold). Immunofluorescence staining and Western blotting showed smooth 
muscle-specific expression of α-smooth muscle actin (SMA) and calponin was 
higher in KO pigs (P < 0.05) than in WT pigs. KO pigs had less fat deposition 
inside the corpus cavernosum, and showed downregulation of adiponectin (ADIPOQ) 
and fatty acid synthase (FASN) (2.5-fold and 1.9-fold loss, respectively). In 
vitro experiments showed MSTN interference promoted corporal smooth muscle cell 
growth and expression of smooth muscle-specific markers, whereas it 
downregulated the expression of fat-specific genes, ADIPOQ and FASN. MSTN 
inhibition could promote smooth muscle growth and decrease fat deposition in the 
corpus cavernosum. MSTN, thus, could be a possible target for the treatment of 
smooth muscle dystrophy-related disorders such as erectile dysfunction.

The inhibitor of κB kinase β (IKKβ) phosphorylates IκBα twice in a single 
binding event through a sequential mechanism.

Stephenson AA(1), Taggart DJ(2), Xu G(3), Fowler JD(2), Wu H(3), Suo Z(4).

Phosphorylation of Inhibitor of κB (IκB) proteins by IκB Kinase β (IKKβ) leads 
to IκB degradation and subsequent activation of nuclear factor κB transcription 
factors. Of particular interest is the IKKβ-catalyzed phosphorylation of IκBα 
residues Ser32 and Ser36 within a conserved destruction box motif. To 
investigate the catalytic mechanism of IKKβ, we performed pre-steady-state 
kinetic analysis of the phosphorylation of IκBα protein substrates catalyzed by 
constitutively active, human IKKβ. Phosphorylation of full-length IκBα catalyzed 
by IKKβ was characterized by a fast exponential phase followed by a slower 
linear phase. The maximum observed rate (kp) of IKKβ-catalyzed phosphorylation 
of IκBα was 0.32 s-1 and the binding affinity of ATP for the IKKβ•IκBα complex 
(Kd) was 12 μM. Substitution of either Ser32 or Ser36 with Ala, Asp, or Cys 
reduced the amplitude of the exponential phase by approximately 2-fold. Thus, 
the exponential phase was attributed to phosphorylation of IκBα at Ser32 and 
Ser36, whereas the slower linear phase was attributed to phosphorylation of 
other residues. Interestingly, the exponential rate of phosphorylation of the 
IκBα(S32D) phosphomimetic amino acid substitution mutant was nearly twice that 
of WT IκBα and 4-fold faster than any of the other IκBα amino acid substitution 
mutants, suggesting that phosphorylation of Ser32 increases the phosphorylation 
rate of Ser36. These conclusions were supported by parallel experiments using 
GST-IκBα(1-54) fusion protein substrates bearing the first 54 residues of IκBα. 
Our data suggest a model wherein, IKKβ phosphorylates IκBα at Ser32 followed by 
Ser36 within a single binding event.

α/β-Hydrolase Domain-Containing 6 (ABHD6)- A Multifunctional Lipid Hydrolase.

Pusch LM(1), Riegler-Berket L(1), Oberer M(1)(2)(3), Zimmermann R(1)(2)(3), 
Taschler U(1).

α/β-hydrolase domain-containing 6 (ABHD6) belongs to the α/β-hydrolase fold 
superfamily and was originally discovered in a functional proteomic approach 
designed to discover monoacylglycerol (MAG) hydrolases in the mouse brain 
degrading the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol. Subsequent studies 
confirmed that ABHD6 acts as an MAG hydrolase regulating cannabinoid 
receptor-dependent and -independent signaling processes. The enzyme was 
identified as a negative modulator of insulin secretion and regulator of energy 
metabolism affecting the pathogenesis of obesity and metabolic syndrome. It has 
been implicated in the metabolism of the lysosomal co-factor 
bis(monoacylglycerol)phosphate and in the surface delivery of 
α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid-type glutamate receptors. 
Finally, ABHD6 was shown to affect cancer cell lipid metabolism and tumor 
malignancy. Here, we provide new insights into the experimentally derived 
crystal structure of ABHD6 and its possible orientation in biological membranes, 
and discuss ABHD6's functions in health and disease.

Fast killing kinetics, significant therapeutic index, and high stability of 
melittin-derived antimicrobial peptide.

Akbari R(1), Hakemi Vala M(2), Sabatier JM(3), Pooshang Bagheri K(4).

The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria is a major challenge for 
antimicrobial chemotherapy. Concerning this issue, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) 
have been presented as novel promising antibiotics. Our previous de novo 
designed melittin-derived peptides (MDP1 and MDP2) indicated their potential as 
peptide drug leads. Accordingly, this study was aimed to evaluate the kinetics 
of activity, toxicity, and stability of MDP1 and MDP2 as well as determination 
of their structures. The killing kinetics of MDP1 and MDP2 demonstrate that all 
bacterial strains were rapidly killed. MDP1 and MDP2 were ca. 100- and 26.6-fold 
less hemolytic than melittin and found to be respectively 72.9- and 41.6-fold 
less cytotoxic than melittin on the HEK293 cell line. MDP1 and MDP2 showed 252- 
and 132-fold improvement in their therapeutic index in comparison to melittin. 
MDP1 and MDP2 sustained their activities in the presence of human plasma and 
were found to be ca. four to eightfold more stable than melittin. 
Spectropolarimetry analysis of MDP1 and MDP2 indicates that the peptides adopt 
an alpha-helical structure predominantly. According to the fast killing 
kinetics, significant therapeutic index, and high stability of MDP1, it could be 
considered as a drug lead in a mouse model of septicemia infections.

Wound Healing and Antioxidant Properties of Launaea procumbens Supported by 
Metabolomic Profiling and Molecular Docking.

Ahmed SR(1)(2), Mostafa EM(1)(3), Musa A(1)(3), Rateb EE(4), Al-Sanea MM(5), 
Abu-Baih DH(6), Elrehany MA(6)(7), Saber EA(8), Rateb ME(9), Abdelmohsen 
UR(10)(11).

Wounds adversely affect people’s quality of life and have psychological, social, 
and economic impacts. Herbal remedies of Launaea procumbens (LP) are used to 
treat wounds. In an excision wound model, topical application of LP 
significantly promoted wound closure (on day 14, LP-treated animals had the 
highest percentages of wound closure in comparison with the other groups, as the 
wound was entirely closed with a closure percentage of 100%, p < 0.05). 
Histological analysis revealed a considerable rise in the number of fibroblasts, 
the amount of collagen, and its cross-linking in LP-treated wounds. Gene 
expression patterns showed significant elevation of TGF-β levels (2.1-fold 
change after 7 days treatment and 2.7-fold change in 14 days treatment) and 
downregulation of the inflammatory TNF-α and IL-1β levels in LP-treated wounds. 
Regarding in vitro antioxidant activity, LP extract significantly diminished the 
formation of H2O2 radical (IC50 = 171.6 μg/mL) and scavenged the superoxide 
radical (IC50 of 286.7 µg/mL), indicating antioxidant potential in a 
dose-dependent manner. Dereplication of the secondary metabolites using LC-HRMS 
resulted in the annotation of 16 metabolites. The identified compounds were 
docked against important wound-healing targets, including vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF), collagen α-1, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), 
interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). Among 
dereplicated compounds, luteolin 8-C-glucoside (orientin) demonstrated binding 
potential to four investigated targets (VEGF, interleukin 1β, TNF-α, and 
collagen α-1). To conclude, Launaea procumbens extract could be regarded as a 
promising topical therapy to promote wound healing in excisional wounds, and 
luteolin 8-C-glucoside (orientin), one of its constituents, is a potential 
wound-healing drug lead.

PGC-1α overexpression is not sufficient to mitigate cancer cachexia in either 
male or female mice.

MG(1), Lim S(1), Cabrera AR(1), Brown JL(1), Washington TA(2), Greene NP(1).

Cancer cachexia (CC) accounts for 20%-40% of cancer-related deaths. 
Mitochondrial aberrations have been shown to precede muscle atrophy in different 
atrophy models, including cancer. Therefore, this study investigated potential 
protection from the cachectic phenotype through overexpression of peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1 α (PGC-1α). First, to establish 
potential of mitochondria-based approaches we showed that the mitochondrial 
antioxidant MitoTEMPO (MitoT) attenuates myotube atrophy induced by Lewis lung 
carcinoma (LLC) cell conditioned media. Next, cachexia was induced in 
muscle-specific PGC-1α overexpressing (MCK-PCG1α) or wildtype (WT) littermate 
mice by LLC implantation. MCK-PCG1α did not protect LLC-induced muscle mass 
loss. In plantaris, Atrogin mRNA content was 6.2-fold and ∼11-fold greater in 
WT-LLC vs WT-phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for males and females, respectively 
(p < 0.05). MitoTimer red:green ratio for male PGC was ∼65% higher than WT 
groups (p < 0.05), with ∼3-fold more red puncta in LLC than PBS (p < 0.05). 
Red:green ratio was ∼56% lower in females WT-LLC vs PGC-LLC (p < 0.05). In 
females, no change in red puncta was noted across conditions. Lc3 mRNA content 
was ∼73% and 2-fold higher in male and female LLC mice, respectively, vs PBS 
(p < 0.05). While MitoT could mitigate cancer-induced atrophy in vitro, PGC-1α 
overexpression was insufficient to protect muscle mass and mitochondrial health 
in vivo despite mitigation of cachexia-associated signaling pathways.

La cachexie cancéreuse représente 20 à 40 % des décès liés au cancer. Il a été 
démontré que les aberrations mitochondriales précèdent l’atrophie musculaire 
dans différents modèles d’atrophie, y compris le cancer. Par conséquent, cette 
étude a analysé la protection potentielle du phénotype cachectique par la 
surexpression de PGC-1α. Premièrement, pour établir le potentiel des approches 
basées sur les mitochondries, nous avons montré que l’antioxydant mitochondrial 
mitoTEMPO atténue l’atrophie des myotubes induite par les milieux conditionnés 
cellulaires du carcinome pulmonaire de Lewis (« LLC »). Ensuite, la cachexie a 
été induite par implantation de LLC chez des souris de même portée dans le 
muscle surexprimant de façon spécifique le PGC-1α (« MCK-PCG1α ») ou de type 
sauvage (« WT »). Le MCK-PCG1α n’a pas protégé la perte de masse musculaire 
induite par LLC. Dans le muscle plantaire, la teneur en ARNm d’Atrogine était 
6,2 fois et 11 fois supérieure dans WT-LLC comparativement à WT-PBS pour les 
mâles et les femelles, respectivement (p < 0,05). Le ratio rouge/vert de 
MitoTimer pour les PGC mâles était d’environ 65 % supérieur à celui des groupes 
WT (p < 0,05) avec environ 3 fois plus de points lacrymaux rouges dans LLC que 
dans PBS (p < 0,05). Le ratio rouge/vert était d’environ 56 % inférieur chez les 
femelles WT-LLC comparativement à PGC-LLC (p < 0,05). Chez les femelles, aucun 
changement dans les points lacrymaux rouges n’a été noté dans toutes les 
conditions. La teneur en ARNm de Lc3 était d’environ 73 % et 2 fois plus élevée 
chez les souris LLC mâles et femelles respectivement comparativement au PBS (p < 
0, 05). Alors que MitoTEMPO pouvait atténuer l’atrophie induite par le cancer in 
vitro, la surexpression de PGC1α était insuffisante pour protéger la masse 
musculaire et la santé mitochondriale in vivo même en présence de l’atténuation 
des voies de signalisation associées à la cachexie. [Traduit par la Rédaction]

Research into the Bioengineering of a Novel α-Conotoxin from the Milked Venom of 
Conus obscurus.

The marine cone snail produces one of the fastest prey strikes in the animal 
kingdom. It injects highly efficacious venom, often causing prey paralysis and 
death within seconds. Each snail has hundreds of conotoxins, which serve as a 
source for discovering and utilizing novel analgesic peptide therapeutics. In 
this study, we discovered, isolated, and synthesized a novel α3/5-conotoxins 
derived from the milked venom of Conus obscurus (α-conotoxin OI) and identified 
the presence of α-conotoxin SI-like sequence previously found in the venom of 
Conus striatus. Five synthetic analogs of the native α-conotoxin OI were 
generated. These analogs incorporated single residue or double residue 
mutations. Three synthetic post-translational modifications (PTMs) were 
synthetically incorporated into these analogs: N-terminal truncation, proline 
hydroxylation, and tryptophan bromination. The native α-conotoxin OI 
demonstrated nanomolar potency in Poecilia reticulata and Homosapiens 
muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) isoforms. Moreover, the 
synthetic α-[P9K] conotoxin OI displayed enhanced potency in both bioassays, 
ranging from a 2.85 (LD50) to 18.4 (IC50) fold increase in comparative 
bioactivity. The successful incorporation of PTMs, with retention of both 
potency and nAChR isoform selectivity, ultimately pushes new boundaries of 
peptide bioengineering and the generation of novel α-conotoxin-like sequences.

Analysis of Anti-Cancer and Anti-Inflammatory Properties of 25 High-THC Cannabis 
Extracts.

Li D(1), Ilnytskyy Y(1), Ghasemi Gojani E(1), Kovalchuk O(1), Kovalchuk I(1).

Cannabis sativa is one of the oldest cultivated plants. Many of the medicinal 
properties of cannabis are known, although very few cannabis-based formulations 
became prescribed drugs. Previous research demonstrated that cannabis varieties 
are very different in their medicinal properties, likely due to the entourage 
effect-the synergistic or antagonistic effect of various cannabinoids and 
terpenes. In this work, we analyzed 25 cannabis extracts containing high levels 
of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). We used HCC1806 squamous cell carcinoma 
and demonstrated various degrees of efficiency of the tested extracts, from 66% 
to 92% of growth inhibition of cancer cells. Inflammation was tested by 
induction of inflammation with TNF-α/IFN-γ in WI38 human lung fibroblasts. The 
efficiency of the extracts was tested by analyzing the expression of COX2 and 
IL6; while some extracts aggravated inflammation by increasing the expression of 
COX2/IL6 by 2-fold, other extracts decreased inflammation, reducing expression 
of cytokines by over 5-fold. We next analyzed the level of THC, CBD, CBG and CBN 
and twenty major terpenes and performed clustering and association analysis 
between the chemical composition of the extracts and their efficiency in 
inhibiting cancer growth and curbing inflammation. A positive correlation was 
found between the presence of terpinene (pval = 0.002) and anti-cancer property; 
eucalyptol came second, with pval of 0.094. p-cymene and β-myrcene positively 
correlated with the inhibition of IL6 expression, while camphor correlated 
negatively. No significant correlation was found for COX2. We then performed a 
correlation analysis between cannabinoids and terpenes and found a positive 
correlation for the following pairs: α-pinene vs. CBD, p-cymene vs. CBGA, 
terpenolene vs. CBGA and isopulegol vs. CBGA. Our work, thus, showed that most 
of high-THC extracts demonstrate anti-cancer activity, while only certain 
selected extracts showed anti-inflammatory activity. Presence of certain 
terpenes, such as terpinene, eucalyptol, cymene, myrcene and camphor, appear to 
have modulating effects on the activity of cannabinoids.

A New iNKT-Cell Agonist-Adjuvanted SARS-CoV-2 Subunit Vaccine Elicits Robust 
Neutralizing Antibody Responses.

Li YQ(1), Yan C(2), Wang XF(2), Xian MY(2), Zou GQ(2), Gao XF(3), Luo R(1), Liu 
Z(2).

Adjuvants are essential components of vaccines. Invariant natural killer T 
(iNKT) cells are a distinct subset of T cells that function to bridge the innate 
and adaptive immunities and are capable of mediating strong and rapid responses 
to a range of diseases, including cancer and infectious disease. An increasing 
amount of evidence suggests that iNKT cells can help fight viral infection. In 
particular, iNKT-secreting IL-4 is a key mediator of humoral immunity and has a 
positive correlation with the levels of neutralizing antibodies. As iNKT cell 
agonists, αGC glycolipid (α-galactosylceramide, or KRN7000) and its analogues as 
vaccine adjuvants have begun to provide vaccinologists with a new toolset. 
Herein we found that a new iNKT-cell agonist αGC-CPOEt elicited a strong 
cytokine response with increased IL-4 production. Remarkably, after three 
immunizations, SARS-CoV-2 RBD-Fc adjuvanted by αGC-CPOEt evoked robust 
neutralizing antibody responses that were about 5.5-fold more than those induced 
by αGC/RBD-Fc and 25-fold greater than those induced by unadjuvanted RBD-Fc. 
These findings imply that αGC-CPOEt could be investigated further as a new 
COVID-19 vaccine adjuvant to prevent current and future infectious disease 
outbreaks.

AcrNET: predicting anti-CRISPR with deep learning.

Li Y(1), Wei Y(1), Xu S(1), Tan Q(1), Zong L(1), Wang J(1), Wang Y(1), Chen 
J(1), Hong L(1), Li Y(1).

MOTIVATION: As an important group of proteins discovered in phages, anti-CRISPR 
inhibits the activity of the immune system of bacteria (i.e. CRISPR-Cas), 
offering promise for gene editing and phage therapy. However, the prediction and 
discovery of anti-CRISPR are challenging due to their high variability and fast 
evolution. Existing biological studies rely on known CRISPR and anti-CRISPR 
pairs, which may not be practical considering the huge number. Computational 
methods struggle with prediction performance. To address these issues, we 
propose a novel deep neural network for anti-CRISPR analysis (AcrNET), which 
achieves significant performance.
RESULTS: On both the cross-fold and cross-dataset validation, our method 
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Notably, AcrNET improves the 
prediction performance by at least 15% regarding the F1 score for the 
cross-dataset test problem comparing with state-of-art Deep Learning method. 
Moreover, AcrNET is the first computational method to predict the detailed 
anti-CRISPR classes, which may help illustrate the anti-CRISPR mechanism. Taking 
advantage of a Transformer protein language model ESM-1b, which was pre-trained 
on 250 million protein sequences, AcrNET overcomes the data scarcity problem. 
Extensive experiments and analysis suggest that the Transformer model feature, 
evolutionary feature, and local structure feature complement each other, which 
indicates the critical properties of anti-CRISPR proteins. AlphaFold prediction, 
further motif analysis, and docking experiments further demonstrate that AcrNET 
can capture the evolutionarily conserved pattern and the interaction between 
anti-CRISPR and the target implicitly.

Impact of ionizers on prevention of airborne infection in classroom.

Ren C(1), Haghighat F(2)(1), Feng Z(1), Kumar P(3)(4)(1), Cao SJ(1)(3).

Infectious diseases (e.g., coronavirus disease 2019) dramatically impact human 
life, economy and social development. Exploring the low-cost and energy-saving 
approaches is essential in removing infectious virus particles from indoors, 
such as in classrooms. The application of air purification devices, such as 
negative ion generators (ionizers), gains popularity because of the favorable 
removal capacity for particles and the low operation cost. However, small and 
portable ionizers have potential disadvantages in the removal efficiency owing 
to the limited horizontal diffusion of negative ions. This study aims to 
investigate the layout strategy (number and location) of ionizers based on the 
energy-efficient natural ventilation in the classroom to improve removal 
efficiency (negative ions to particles) and decrease infection risk. Three 
infected students were considered in the classroom. The simulations of negative 
ion and particle concentrations were performed and validated by the experiment. 
Results showed that as the number of ionizers was 4 and 5, the removal 
performance was largely improved by combining ionizer with natural ventilation. 
Compared with the scenario without an ionizer, the scenario with 5 ionizers 
largely increased the average removal efficiency from around 20% to 85% and 
decreased the average infection risk by 23%. The setup with 5 ionizers placed 
upstream of the classroom was determined as the optimal layout strategy, 
particularly when the location and number of the infected students were unknown. 
This work can provide a guideline for applying ionizers to public buildings when 
natural ventilation is used.

Comparative study for removal of phosphorus from aqueous solution by natural and 
activated bentonite.

Elgarhy AH(1)(2), Mahran BNA(1), Liu G(3), Salem TA(4), ElSayed EE(5), Ibrahim 
LA(1)(6).

The novelty of the current article is to investigate the adsorption potential of 
the Egyptian natural and activated bentonite (Na-bentonite) to inorganic and 
organic phosphorus (IP, OP) in aqueous media. The natural bentonite (NB) was 
activated to Na-bentonite (Na-B) by a new facile method within 2 h. NB and Na-B 
were also characterized using XRD, XRF, BET ESM, and FT-IR. The batch experiment 
has been employed to select the ideal conditions for the removal of inorganic 
and organic phosphorus (IP, OP) from aqueous solutions. The findings clearly 
showed that the Na-bentonite is enriched with sodium in the form of 
Na-montmorillonite with a higher specific area 138.51 m2/g than the value for 
the natural bentonite 74.21 m2/g. The batch experiment showed maximum absorption 
for both IP and OP adsorbents occurred at an equilibrium pH = 6, contact time of 
40 to 50 min, 40 °C temperature, and a dose rate of 2 mg/L and 1 mg/L, 
respectively. The equilibrium data displayed better adjustment to Langmuir than 
the Freundlich, Temkin, and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherms and adsorption 
kinetics followed the pseudo-second-order-type kinetic, and the parameters of 
thermodynamics reveal that adsorption occurs spontaneously and exothermic 
nature. Na-bentonite proved to be more efficient in removing target material

A modelling method for large-scale open spaces orientated toward coordinated 
control of multiple air-terminal units.

Zhou P(1), Wang S(1), Zhou J(1), Hussain SA(2), Liu X(1), Gao J(3), Huang G(4).

The temperature distribution is always assumed to be homogeneous in a 
traditional single-input-single-output (SISO) air conditioning control strategy. 
However, the airflow inside is more complicated and unpredictable. This study 
proposes a zonal temperature control strategy with a thermal coupling effect 
integrated for air-conditioned large-scale open spaces. The target space was 
split into several subzones based on the minimum controllable air terminal units 
in the proposed method, and each zone can be controlled to its own set-point 
while considering the thermal coupling effect from its adjacent zones. A 
numerical method resorting to computational fluid dynamics was presented to 
obtain the heat transfer coefficients (HTCs) under different air supply 
scenarios. The relationship between heat transfer coefficient and zonal 
temperature difference was linearized. Thus, currently available zonal models in 
popular software can be used to simulate the dynamic response of temperatures in 
large-scale indoor open spaces. Case studies showed that the introduction of 
HTCs across the adjacent zones was capable of enhancing the precision of 
temperature control of large-scale open spaces. It could satisfy the temperature 
requirements of different zones, improve thermal comfort and at least 11% of 
energy saving can be achieved by comparing with the conventional control 
strategy.

Critical Consideration of Tuberculosis Management of Papua New Guinea Nationals 
and Cross-Border Health Issues in the Remote Torres Strait Islands, Australia.

Foster J(1)(2)(3), Mendez D(2), Marais BJ(4), Denholm JT(5)(6), Peniyamina D(7), 
McBryde ES(1)(2)(3).

The international border between Australia and Papua New Guinea (PNG) serves as 
a gateway for the delivery of primary and tertiary healthcare for PNG patients 
presenting to Australian health facilities with presumptive tuberculosis (TB). 
An audit of all PNG nationals with presumptive TB who presented to clinics in 
the Torres Strait between 2016 and 2019 was conducted to evaluate outcomes for 
PNG patients and to consider the consistency and equity of decision-making 
regarding aeromedical evacuation. We also reviewed the current aeromedical 
retrieval policy and the outcomes of patients referred back to Daru General 
Hospital in PNG. During the study period, 213 PNG nationals presented with 
presumptive TB to primary health centres (PHC) in the Torres Strait. In total, 
44 (21%) patients were medically evacuated to Australian hospitals; 26 met the 
evacuation criteria of whom 3 died, and 18 did not meet the criteria of whom 1 
died. A further 22 patients who met the medical evacuation criteria into 
Australia were referred to Daru General Hospital of whom 2 died and 10 were lost 
to follow-up. The cross-border movement of people from PNG into Australia is 
associated with an emergent duty of care. Ongoing monitoring and evaluation of 
patient outcomes are necessary for transparency and justice.

Interferon-alpha regulates expression of lncRNA MALAT1 and interferon-stimulated 
genes, as well as chemokine production, in primary Sjögren's syndrome.

Amezcua-Guerra LM(1), Sánchez-Muñoz F(2), Pichardo-Ontiveros E(3), 
González-Ramírez J(4), Martínez-Martínez LA(5), Juárez-Vicuña Y(6).

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the contribution of interferon-alpha 
(IFN-α) to MALAT1 expression in primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS).
METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from pSS patients and healthy 
blood donors were stimulated with recombinant human IFN-α, and the expression 
levels of MALAT1 and several interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) were measured by 
RT-PCR, while supernatant levels of interferon-regulated chemokines were 
measured using multiplex cytokine immunobead assay.
RESULTS: In this work, we found that MALAT1 expression levels were increased in 
IFN-α-stimulated PBMC from pSS patients and healthy controls. As expected, ISG 
expression levels and interferon-regulated chemokine secretion levels were 
higher after IFN-α stimulation. However, the fold-change values for ISG15, Ly6E, 
OAS1, and OASL expression levels were higher in cells from pSS patients than in 
controls. Similarly, PBMC from pSS patients produced higher concentrations of 
chemokines than those from healthy controls after IFN-α stimulation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide insights into the abnormal IFN-α-mediated 
regulation of the lncRNA MALAT1 in pSS. Based on an unusually high capacity of 
PBMC to express ISG and to produce interferon-responsive chemokines, it is 
likely that targeted therapies to block these molecules may be of benefit to 
patients with pSS.

Exposure to e-cigarette vapor extract induces vocal fold epithelial injury and 
triggers intense mucosal remodeling.

Lungova V(1), Wendt K(1), Thibeault SL(2).

Vaping has been reported to cause acute epiglottitis, a life-threatening airway 
obstruction induced by direct epithelial injury and subsequent inflammatory 
reaction. Here, we show that we were able to recapitulate this phenomenon in 
vitro. Exposure of human engineered vocal fold (VF) mucosae to 0.5% and 5% 
electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) vapor extract (ECVE) for 1 week induced 
cellular damage of luminal cells, disrupting homeostasis and innate immune 
responses. Epithelial erosion was likely caused by accumulation of solvents and 
lipid particles in the cytosol and intercellular spaces, which altered lipid 
metabolism and plasma membrane properties. Next, we investigated how the mucosal 
cells responded to the epithelial damage. We withdrew the ECVE from the 
experimental system and allowed VF mucosae to regenerate for 1, 3 and 7 days, 
which triggered intense epithelial remodeling. The epithelial changes included 
expansion of P63 (TP63)-positive basal cells and cytokeratin 14 (KRT14) and 
laminin subunit α-5 (LAMA5) deposition, which might lead to local basal cell 
hyperplasia, hyperkeratinization and basement membrane thickening. In summary, 
vaping presents a threat to VF mucosal health and airway protection, thereby 
raising further concerns over the safety of e-cigarette use. This article has an 
associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.

Pasture-finishing of bison improves animal metabolic health and potential 
health-promoting compounds in meat.

C(5), van Wietmarchsen HA(6), van Eekeren N(6), Kronberg SL(7), Provenza 
FD(8)(7).

BACKGROUND: With rising concerns regarding the effects of red meat on human and 
environmental health, a growing number of livestock producers are exploring ways 
to improve production systems. A promising avenue includes agro-ecological 
practices such as rotational grazing of locally adapted ruminants. Additionally, 
growing consumer interest in pasture-finished meat (i.e., grass-fed) has raised 
questions about its nutritional composition. Thus, the goal of this study was to 
determine the impact of two common finishing systems in North American 
bison-pasture-finished or pen-finished on concentrates for 146 d-on metabolomic, 
lipidomic, and fatty acid profiles of striploins (M. longissimus lumborum).
RESULTS: Six hundred and seventy-one (671) out of 1570 profiled compounds (43%) 
differed between pasture- and pen-finished conditions (n = 20 animals per group) 
(all, P < 0.05). Relative to pasture-finished animals, the muscle of 
pen-finished animals displayed elevated glucose metabolites (~ 1.6-fold), 
triglycerides (~ 2-fold), markers of oxidative stress (~ 1.5-fold), and 
proteolysis (~ 1.2-fold). In contrast, pasture-finished animals displayed 
improved mitochondrial (~ 1.3-fold higher levels of various Krebs cycle 
metabolites) and carnitine metabolism (~ 3-fold higher levels of long-chain acyl 
carnitines) (all P < 0.05). Pasture-finishing also concentrated higher levels of 
phenolics (~ 2.3-fold), alpha-tocopherol (~ 5.8-fold), carotene (~ 2.0-fold), 
and very long-chain fatty acids (~ 1.3-fold) in their meat, while having lower 
levels of a common advanced lipoxidation (4-hydroxy-nonenal-glutathione; 
~ 2-fold) and glycation end-product (N6-carboxymethyllysine; ~ 1.7-fold) (all 
P < 0.05). In contrast, vitamins B5, B6, and C, gamma/beta-tocopherol, and three 
phenolics commonly found in alfalfa were ~ 2.5-fold higher in pen-finished 
animals (all P < 0.05); suggesting some concentrate feeding, or grazing plants 
rich in those compounds, may be beneficial.
CONCLUSIONS: Pasture-finishing (i.e., grass-fed) broadly improves bison 
metabolic health and accumulates additional potential health-promoting compounds 
in their meat compared to concentrate finishing in confinement (i.e., 
pen-finished). Our data, however, does not indicate that meat from pen-finished 
bison is therefore unhealthy. The studied bison meat-irrespective of finishing 
practice-contained favorable omega 6:3 ratios (< 3.2), and amino acid and 
vitamin profiles. Our study represents one of the deepest meat profiling studies 
to date (> 1500 unique compounds), having revealed previously unrecognized 
differences in animal metabolic health and nutritional composition because of 
finishing mode. Whether observed nutritional differences have an appreciable 
effect on human health remains to be determined.

Sodium benzoate attenuates 2,8-dihydroxyadenine nephropathy by inhibiting 
monocyte/macrophage TNF-α expression.

Yoshimoto K(1), Sasabe J(3), Yasui M(3), Itoh H(1).

Sodium benzoate (SB), a known D-amino acid oxidase (DAO) enzyme inhibitor, has 
an anti-inflammatory effect, although its role in renal damage has not been 
explored. 2,8-dihydroxyadenine crystal induced chronic kidney disease, in which 
TNF-α is involved in the pathogenesis, was established by oral adenine 
administration in C57BL/6JJcl mice (AdCKD) with or without SB to investigate its 
renal protective effects. SB significantly attenuated AdCKD by decreasing serum 
creatinine and urea nitrogen levels, and kidney interstitial fibrosis and 
tubular atrophy scores. The survival of AdCKD mice improved 2.6-fold by SB 
administration. SB significantly decreased the number of infiltrating 
macrophages observed in the positive F4/80 immunohistochemistry area and reduced 
the expression of macrophage markers and inflammatory genes, including TNF-α, in 
the kidneys of AdCKD. Human THP-1 cells stimulated with either 
lipopolysaccharide or TNF-α showed increased expression of inflammatory genes, 
although this was significantly reduced by SB, confirming the anti-inflammatory 
effects of SB. SB exhibited renal protective effects in AdCKD in DAO enzyme 
deficient mice, suggesting that anti-inflammatory effect of SB was independent 
of DAO enzyme activity. Moreover, binding to motif DNA sequence, protein level, 
and mRNA level of NF-κB RelB were significantly inhibited by SB in AdCKD kidneys 
and lipopolysaccharide treated THP-1 cells, respectively. We report that 
anti-inflammatory property of SB is independent of DAO enzymatic activity and is 
associated with down regulated NF-κB RelB as well as its downstream inflammatory 
genes such as TNF-α in AdCKD.

α-Lipoic Acid Derivatives as Allosteric Modulators for Targeting AMPA-Type 
Glutamate Receptors' Gating Modules.

Qneibi M(1), Nassar S(2), Bdir S(1), Hidmi A(2).

The ionotropic glutamate receptor subtype α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole 
propionic acid (AMPA) is responsible for most excitatory transmission in the 
brain. AMPA receptor function is altered in numerous neurological illnesses, 
making AMPA receptors appealing therapeutic targets for clinical intervention. 
Alpha-Lipoic acid (α-LA) is a naturally occurring compound, which functions as a 
co-factor in metabolism and energy production. α-LA is an antioxidant with 
various benefits in treating diabetes, including managing symptomatic diabetic 
neuropathy. This study will test a novel and innovative strategy to synthesize a 
new isomer of lipoic acid (R-LA) derivatives (bifunctional NO-donor/antioxidant) 
in one chemical on homomeric and heteromeric AMPA receptor subunits. We used 
patch-clamp electrophysiology to examine LA derivatives expressed in human 
embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK293) for inhibition and changes in 
desensitization or deactivation rates. LA derivatives were shown to be potent 
antagonists of AMPA receptors, with an 8-11-fold reduction in AMPA receptor 
currents seen following the delivery of the compounds. Furthermore, the LA 
derivatives influenced the rates of desensitization and deactivation of AMPA 
receptors. Based on our results, especially given that α-LA is closely connected 
to the nervous system, we may better understand using AMPA receptors and 
innovative drugs to treat neurological diseases associated with excessive 
activation of AMPA receptors.

Low Xanthophylls, Retinol, Lycopene, and Tocopherols in Grey and White Matter of 
Brains with Alzheimer's Disease.

Dorey CK(1), Gierhart D(2), Fitch KA(3), Crandell I(4), Craft NE(5).

BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress contributes to pathogenesis and progression of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Higher levels of the dietary antioxidants- carotenoids 
and tocopherols- are associated with better cognitive functions and lower risk 
for AD, and lower levels of multiple carotenoids are found in serum and plasma 
of patients with AD. Although brains donated by individuals with mild cognitive 
impairment had significantly lower levels of lutein and beta-carotene, previous 
investigators found no significant difference in carotenoid levels of brains 
with AD and cognitively normal brains.
OBJECTIVE: This study tested the hypothesis that micronutrients are 
significantly lower in donor brains with AD than in healthy elderly brains.
METHODS: Samples of donor brains with confirmed AD or verified health were 
dissected into grey and white matter, extracted with organic solvents and 
analyzed by HPLC.
RESULTS: AD brains had significantly lower levels of lutein, zeaxanthin, 
anhydrolutein, retinol, lycopene, and alpha-tocopherol, and significantly 
increased levels of XMiAD, an unidentified xanthophyll metabolite. No 
meso-zeaxanthin was detected. The overlapping protective roles of xanthophylls, 
carotenes, α- and γ-tocopherol are discussed.
CONCLUSION: Brains with AD had substantially lower concentrations of some, but 
not all, xanthophylls, carotenes, and tocopherols, and several-fold higher 
concentrations of an unidentified xanthophyll metabolite increased in AD 
(XMiAD).

Modification to increase the thermostability and catalytic efficiency of 
α-L-rhamnosidase from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and high-level expression.

Lu C(1), Dong Y(2), Ke K(2), Zou K(2), Wang Z(3), Xiao W(4), Pei J(2), Zhao 
L(5).

The α-L-rhamnosidase BtRha from Bacteroides thetaiotao VPI-5482 is a specific 
enzyme that selectively hydrolyzes the α-1,2 glycosidic bond between rhamnose 
and rhamnose, allowing the bioconversion of epimedin C to icariin. In this 
study, BtRha was molecularly modified using B-factor-saturation mutagenesis 
strategy and the introduction of disulfide bonds, resulting in a mutant with 
significantly improved catalytic efficiency, S592C, and two thermally stable 
mutants, E39W and E39W-S592C. The results showed that the half-lives of E39W and 
E39W-S592C at 55 °C were 10.4 and 9.4-fold higher, respectively, than that of 
the original enzyme, The mutant S592C showed a 63.3% reduction in Km value and a 
163.6% increase in catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km value), which improved the 
ability to hydrolyze epimedin C to icariin effectively. In addition, high-level 
expression of α-L-rhamnosidase mutant S592C was established. With 0.1 mM IPTG as 
an inducer, induction temperature of 32 °C, induction pH of 7.0 and induction 
OD600 of 50, the maximum activity of mutant S592C reached 182.0 U/mL in terrific 
broth medium after 22 h. This is the highest enzyme activity of α-L-rhamnosidase 
which can convert epimedin C to icariin to date. All the results provide a 
specific and cost-effective α-L-rhamnosidase mutant, which will raise its 
potential interest for the food and pharmaceutical applications.

A third dose of the unmodified COVID-19 mRNA vaccine CVnCoV enhances quality and 
quantity of immune responses.

Schwendt K(3), Rauch S(3), Petsch B(3), Loré K(1)(2).

A third vaccine dose is often required to achieve potent, long-lasting immune 
responses. We investigated the effect of three 8-μg doses of CVnCoV, CureVac's 
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine candidate 
containing sequence-optimized unmodified mRNA encoding the spike 
(S) glycoprotein, administered at 0, 4, and 28 weeks, on immune responses in 
rhesus macaques. After the third dose, S-specific binding and neutralizing 
antibodies increased 50-fold compared with post-dose 2 levels, with increased 
responses also evident in the lower airways and against the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 
(Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 (Gamma), and B.1.617.2 (Delta) variants. Enhanced 
binding affinity of serum antibodies after the third dose correlated with higher 
somatic hypermutation in S-specific B cells, corresponding with improved binding 
properties of monoclonal antibodies expressed from isolated B cells. 
Administration of low-dose mRNA led to fewer cells expressing antigen in vivo at 
the injection site and in the draining lymph nodes compared with a 10-fold 
higher dose, possibly reducing engagement of precursor cells with the antigen 
and resulting in the suboptimal response observed after two-dose vaccination 
schedules in phase IIb/III clinical trials of CVnCoV. However, when immune 
memory is established, a third dose efficiently boosts the immunological 
responses and improves antibody affinity and breadth.

Fermentation of rose residue by Lactiplantibacillus plantarum B7 and Bacillus 
subtilis natto promotes polyphenol content and beneficial bioactivity.

Hu Y(1), Wang XY(2), Qin CQ(3), Li TT(4), Liu WH(5), Ren DF(6).

The present study evaluated the effect of fermentation with Lactiplantibacillus 
plantarum B7 and Bacillus subtilis natto on phenolic compound levels and enzyme 
activity, as well as antioxidant capacity of the rose residue. Results showed 
that the polyphenol content of rose residue was significantly increased from 
16.37 ± 1.51 mg/100 mL to 41.02 ± 1.68 mg/100 mL by fermentation at 37 °C and 
2.0% (v/v) inoculum size for 40 h. The flavone, soluble dietary, and protein 
contents were also enhanced by almost 1-fold, 3-fold, and 1-fold, respectively. 
Fifteen phenolic compounds were quantified in the fermented broth, among which 
the concentration of gallic acid, quercetin, and p-coumaric acid increased by 
5-fold, 4-fold, and almost 8-fold, respectively. Chlorogenic acid was a new 
phenolic compound produced during fermentation. Moreover, the fermented rose 
residue presented higher superoxide dismutase, α-amylase, and protease activity. 
ABTS•+, hydroxylradical, and DPPH• scavenging activity increased by 60.93%, 
57.70%, and 37.00%, respectively. This provides an effective means of 
transforming rose residue into a highly bioactive value-added substance.

Aspergillus flavus YRB2 from Thymelaea hirsuta (L.) Endl., a non-aflatoxigenic 
endophyte with ability to overexpress defense-related genes against Fusarium 
root rot of maize.

Rashad YM(1), Abdalla SA(2), Shehata AS(3).

Fusarium root rot, caused by Fusarium solani (Mart.) Sacc., represents one of 
the most damaging diseases of maize affecting plant growth and yield. In this 
study, the antagonistic potential of a non-aflatoxigenic endophytic Aspergillus 
flavus YRB2, isolated from Thymelaea hirsuta (L.) Endl., was tested against F. 
solani in vitro. In addition, its biocontrol activity against Fusarium root rot 
of maize was evaluated under greenhouse conditions. Its impacts on plant 
molecular, pathological, physiological, and growth levels were also studied. 
Results obtained revealed a potent antagonistic behavior for A. flavus YRB2 
against F. solani in vitro, recording 80% growth inhibition. Seventeen secondary 
metabolites were detected in the n-hexane extract of A. flavus YRB2 filtered 
culture broth using GC-MS analysis. Among them, various antifungal secondary 
metabolites were produced, namely palmitic acid, α-linolenic acid, stearic acid, 
2, 4-di-tert-butylphenol, diisobutyl phthalate, and heneicosane. In contrast, 
HPLC analysis showed that no aflatoxins (B1, B2, G1, and G2) were detected. 
Under greenhouse conditions, colonization of maize plants with A. flavus YRB2 
exhibited a potential biocontrol activity against Fusarium root rot, recording 
73.4% reduction in the disease severity. Triggering of transcriptional 
expression level of the defense-related genes JERF3 (7.2-fold), CHI II (8-fold), 
and POD (9.1-fold) was reported, indicating the inducing effect on the plant 
immunity. In addition, an increment in the antioxidant enzymes POD and PPO, and 
the total phenolic content in maize roots was also observed in response to this 
treatment. Moreover, a growth-promoting effect was also observed for 
colonization of maize plants with A. flavus YRB2. Based on the obtained data, we 
can conclude that A. flavus YRB2 may represent a promising biocontrol and 
growth-promoting agent for maize plants against Fusarium root rot. Nevertheless, 
field evaluation is highly requested before the use recommendation.

Oliveira Feitosa Y(3), Campello GA(3), Dos Santos PHG(3), Rego CL(3), Carvalho 
H(4), Gemperli R(1).

Approximately 80% of patients submitted to radiotherapy develop radiodermatitis. 
Photobiomodulation based on light-emitted diode (LED) is one of the therapeutic 
strategies for treating inflammation. This study aimed to investigate the effect 
of the photobiomodulation with two wavelengths, in an acute radiodermatitis 
animal model.
METHODS: Twenty rats were submitted to one radiotherapy session. After 15 days, 
the rats that developed radiodermatitis were divided into control groups, 
LED-630 nm, LED-850 nm, and LED-630 + 850 nm. The treatment regimen was one 
session lasting 10 minutes on alternate days for 21 days. We analyzed macroscopy 
aspects (RTOG scale), vascular density, dermal appendages, VEGF-a, TNF-alpha, 
MMP-9, and MMP-9 genic expression level.
RESULTS: All LED groups revealed a two-point reduction on the radiodermatitis 
severity grade compared with the baseline classification. Dermal appendage and 
vascular analysis showed a higher counting in all LED groups compared to 
control. This study showed dermal appendages twice in the 630/850 nm group 
compared with the control group. The 630/850 nm group showed six times more 
arterioles than the control group. Regarding genic expression, this study showed 
a 10-fold decrease between LED-630 nm versus LED-630 + 850 nm (P = 0.02) 
interleukin-10 expression and a 12-fold decrease between control versus 
LED-630 nm (P = 0.006) and LED-850 nm (P = 0.002) in TNF-alpha.
CONCLUSION: LED (630 nm, 850 nm, and 630 nm + 850 nm) showed benefit in the 
treatment of radiodermatitis, and the association of the 630 nm + 850 nm and 
630 nm parameters demonstrated the best macroscopic and microscopic results.

SERS nanotags for folate receptor α detection at the single cell level: 
discrimination of overexpressing cells and potential for live cell applications.

Verdin A(1), Sloan-Dennison S(2), Malherbe C(1), Graham D(2), Eppe G(1).

Folate receptor α (FRα) is a high affinity folate membrane receptor that is 
overexpressed in a wide variety of cancers. Detecting the overexpression of this 
receptor is important for cancer cells identification and to potentially guide 
the choice of treatment since several FRα-targeted drugs are currently in 
clinical trials. In this work, we built SERS nanotags based on core@shell Au@Ag 
nanoparticles labelled with resonant Raman-reporter and functionalised with a 
thiolated PEG linker bearing folic acid at the chain end. Using SERS mapping on 
single cells, we showed that the nanotags (FR-nanotags) could specifically 
target FRα on overexpressing HeLa cells and could measure the gradual blocking 
of FRα by free folic acid introduced in the media along the nanotags. With a 
control nanotag, we showed that the SERS response was 10-fold higher on HeLa 
cells when folic acid is present on the PEG linker compared to PEG chains 
without folic acid. Non-specific binding of the FR-nanotags was demonstrated to 
be low and mainly caused by the folic acid molecule at the PEG chain end. When 
comparing cancer cells with different expression levels of FRα, we obtained 
4-fold higher SERS response on overexpressing HeLa cells compared to 
non-overexpressing A549 cells, allowing the discrimination of both cell lines 
with a high contrast. Owing to the biocompatibility of the developed nanotags, 
we demonstrated that measurements of FRα on live HeLa cells were also possible 
and gave similar results to measurements on fixed cells, indicating the 
versatility of the developed nanotags for detecting FRα under various 
experimental conditions.

Sinisan ameliorates colonic injury induced by water immersion restraint stress 
by enhancing intestinal barrier function and the gut microbiota structure.

CONTEXT: Sinisan (SNS) has been used to treat psychosomatic diseases of the 
digestive system. But little is known about how SNS affects water immersion 
restraint stress (WIRS).
OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of SNS on colonic tissue injury in the WIRS 
model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight Kunming (KM) mice were randomized into 6 
groups (n = 8): The control and WIRS groups receiving deionized water; the SNS 
low-dose (SL, 3.12 g/kg/d), SNS middle-dose (SM, 6.24 g/kg/d), SNS high-dose 
(SH, 12.48 g/kg/d), and diazepam (DZ, 5 mg/kg/d) groups; each with two daily 
administrations for 5 consecutive days. The 5 treatment groups were subjected to 
WIRS for 24 h on day 6. The effects of SNS on colon tissue injury caused by WIRS 
were assessed by changes in colon histology, inflammatory cytokines, brain-gut 
peptides, and tight junction (TJ) proteins levels. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was 
used to detect the regulation of the gut microbiota.
RESULTS: SNS pretreatment significantly reduced TNF-α (0.75- to 0.81-fold), IL-6 
(0.77-fold), and IFN-γ (0.69-fold) levels; and increased TJ proteins levels, 
such as ZO-1 (4.06- to 5.27-fold), claudin-1 (3.33- to 5.14-fold), and occludin 
(6.46- to 11.82-fold). However, there was no significant difference between the 
levels of substance P (SP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) in the 
control and WIRS groups. SNS regulated the composition of gut microbiota in WIRS 
mice.
CONCLUSION: The positive effects of SNS on WIRS could provide a theoretical 
basis to treat stress-related gastrointestinal disorders.

LC-MS/MS-Based Absolute Quantitation of Hemoglobin Subunits from Dried Blood 
Spots Reveals Novel Biomarkers for α-Thalassemia Silent Carriers.

Identification of α-thalassemia silent carriers is challenging with conventional 
phenotype-based screening methods. A liquid chromatography tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based approach may offer novel biomarkers to address 
this conundrum. In this study, we collected dried blood spot samples from 
individuals with three α-thalassemia subtypes for biomarker discovery and 
validation. We observed differential expression patterns of hemoglobin subunits 
among various α-thalassemia subtypes and normal controls through proteomic 
profiling of 51 samples in the discovery phase. Then, we developed and optimized 
a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) assay to measure all detectable hemoglobin 
subunits. The validation phase was conducted in a cohort of 462 samples. Among 
the measured hemoglobin subunits, subunit μ was significantly upregulated in all 
the α-thalassemia groups with distinct fold changes. The hemoglobin subunit μ 
exhibits great potential as a novel biomarker for α-thalassemia, especially for 
silent α-thalassemia. We constructed predictive models based on the 
concentrations of hemoglobin subunits and their ratios to classify the various 
subtypes of α-thalassemia. In the binary classification problems of silent 
α-thalassemia vs normal, non-deletional α-thalassemia vs normal, and deletional 
α-thalassemia vs normal, the best performance of the models achieved average 
ROCAUCs of 0.9505, 0.9430, and 0.9976 in the cross-validation, respectively. In 
the multiclass model, the best performance achieved an average ROCAUC of 0.9290 
in cross-validation. The performance of our MRM assay and models demonstrated 
that the hemoglobin subunit μ would play a vital role in screening silent 
α-thalassemia in clinical practice.

Mutagenesis of Dimer Interfacial Residues Improves the Activity and Specificity 
of Methyltransferase for cis-α-Irone Biosynthesis.

X(1).

Promiscuous enzymes show great potential to establish new-to-nature pathways and 
expand chemical diversity. Enzyme engineering strategies are often employed to 
tailor such enzymes to improve their activity or specificity. It is paramount to 
identify the target residues to be mutated. Here, by exploring the inactivation 
mechanism with the aid of mass spectrometry, we have identified and mutated 
critical residues at the dimer interface region of the promiscuous 
methyltransferase (pMT) that converts psi-ionone to irone. The optimized pMT12 
mutant showed ∼1.6-4.8-fold higher kcat than the previously reported best 
mutant, pMT10, and increased the cis-α-irone percentage from ∼70 to ∼83%. By 
one-step biotransformation, ∼121.8 mg L-1 cis-α-irone was produced from 
psi-ionone by the pMT12 mutant. The study offers new opportunities to engineer 
enzymes with enhanced activity and specificity.

Discovery of small-molecule protein stabilizers toward exogenous 
alpha-l-iduronidase to reduce the accumulated heparan sulfate in 
mucopolysaccharidosis type I cells.

Synthesis of a series of l-iduronic acid (IdoA)- and imino-IdoA-typed 
C-glycosides for modulating α-l-iduronidase (IDUA) activity is described. In an 
enzyme inhibition study, IdoA-typed C-glycosides were more potent than 
imino-IdoA analogs, with the most potent IdoA-typed C-glycoside 27c showing an 
IC50 value of 1 μM. On the other hand, co-treatment of 12 with rh-α-IDUA in 
mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) fibroblasts exhibited a nearly 3-fold 
increase of the IDUA activity, resulting in a clear reduction of the accumulated 
heparan sulfate (HS) compared to the exogenous enzyme treatment alone. This is 
the first report of small molecules facilitating IDUA stabilization, enhancing 
enzyme activity, and reducing accumulated HS in MPS I cell-based assays, which 
reveals that small molecules as rh-α-IDUA stabilizers to improve enzyme 
replacement therapy (ERT) efficacy toward MPS I is feasible and promising.

Triple-action of the standardized antidiabetic polyherbal extract; Synacinn(™) 
through upregulation of GLUT(4) and inhibition of DPP(IV), α-amylase, and 
α-glucosidase activity.

Zakaria NH(1).

INTRODUCTION: Synacinn™ is a standardized polyherbal supplement for diabetes 
mellitus which is formulated from Andrographis paniculata, Curcuma xanthorrhiza, 
Cinnamomum zeylanicum, Eugenia polyantha, and Orthosiphon stamineous.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study aimed to elucidate the antidiabetic potential 
of Synacinn™ on three specific actions, including 1) the insulin sensitivity and 
glucose transport on dexamethasone-induced insulin-resistance 3T3-L1 adipocytes, 
2) the inhibitory capacity on postprandial enzyme activity (α-amylase and 
α-glucosidase), and 3) the inhibitory activity of hepatic DPP(IV) enzyme.
RESULTS: Results showed that insulin resistance of 3T3-L1 adipocytes may be 
developed by prolonging the exposure of 1μg/ml of dexamethasone for >48 hours. 
The insulinresistance condition was minimized by the treatment of 10 μg/ml of 
Synacinn™ which significantly improved the insulin-stimulated glucose 
utilization by 10.6%. Meanwhile, insulin-stimulated glucose utilization in 
normal adipocytes was also attenuated by 9.2%. At the cellular level, Synacinn™ 
attenuated glucose utilization mainly by upregulating GLUT4 protein expression 
by 1.71 fold. Additionally, Synacinn™ is a potent inhibitor for the activity of 
α-amylase and α-glucosidase with IC50 of 0.467 mg/mL and 0.245 mg/mL, 
respectively. Synacinn™ also controlled the glycemic index through inhibition of 
hepatic DPP(IV) enzyme with IC50 of 1.11 mg/mL.
CONCLUSION: Results suggested that Synacinn™ reduced diabetes mellitus through 
sensitizing the cellular glucose utilization, reducing the postprandial 
carbohydrate degradation, and inhibiting the hepatic DPP(IV) enzyme function.

An Extended DNA Binding Domain of the Estrogen Receptor Alpha Directly Interacts 
with RNAs in Vitro.

Steiner HR(1), Lammer NC(1), Batey RT(1), Wuttke DS(1).

Estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) is a ligand-responsive transcription factor 
critical for sex determination and development. Recent reports challenge the 
canonical view of ERα function by suggesting an activity beyond binding dsDNA at 
estrogen-responsive promotor elements: association with RNAs in vivo. Whether 
these interactions are direct or indirect remains unknown, which limits the 
ability to understand the extent, specificity, and biological role of ERα-RNA 
binding. Here we demonstrate that an extended DNA-binding domain of ERα directly 
binds a wide range of RNAs in vitro with structural specificity. ERα binds RNAs 
that adopt a range of hairpin-derived structures independent of sequence, while 
interacting poorly with single- and double-stranded RNA. RNA affinities are only 
4-fold weaker than consensus dsDNA and significantly tighter than nonconsensus 
dsDNA sequences. Moreover, RNA binding is competitive with DNA binding. 
Together, these data show that ERα utilizes an extended DNA-binding domain to 
achieve a high-affinity/low-specificity mode for interacting with RNA.

Phytochemical Properties and In Vitro Biological Activities of Phenolic 
Compounds from Flower of Clitoria ternatea L.

Li C(1), Tang W(1), Chen S(1), He J(1), Li X(2), Zhu X(3), Li H(3), Peng Y(3).

Phenolic compounds from the flower of Clitoria ternatea L. (PCFCTL) were 
extracted using a high-speed shearing extraction technique and purified by AB-8 
macroporous resins, and the phytochemical composition of the purified phenolic 
compounds from the flower of Clitoria ternatea L. (PPCFCTL) was then analyzed. 
Subsequently, its bioactivities including antioxidant properties, enzyme 
inhibitory activities, and antiproliferative activities against several tumor 
cell lines were evaluated. Results indicated that the contents of total 
phenolics, flavonoids, flavonols, flavanols, and phenolic acids in PPCFCTL were 
increased by 3.29, 4.11, 2.74, 2.43, and 2.96-fold, respectively, compared with 
those before being purified by AB-8 macroporous resins. The results showed 
PPCFCTL have significant antioxidant ability (measured by reducing power, RP, 
and ferric reducing antioxidant power method, FRAP) and good DPPH, ABTS+, and 
superoxide anion radical scavenging activities. They can also significantly 
inhibit lipase, α-amylase, and α-glucosidase. In addition, morphological changes 
of HeLa, HepG2, and NCI-H460 tumor cells demonstrated the superior antitumor 
performance of PPCFCTL. However, the acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity 
was relatively weak. These findings suggest that PPCFCTL have important 
potential as natural antioxidant, antilipidemic, anti-glycemic and 
antineoplastic agents in health-promoting foods.

RSPO4 is a potential risk gene of stages III-IV, grade C periodontitis through 
effects on innate immune response and oral barrier integrity.

R(5)(6), Carracedo A(5)(6), Blanco J(7), Dommisch H(1), Schaefer AS(1).

AIM: R-spondin 4 (RSPO4) is a suggestive risk gene of stage III-IV, grade C 
periodontitis and upregulated in gingiva of mice resistant to bacteria-induced 
alveolar bone loss. We aimed to replicate the association, identify and 
characterize the putative causal variant(s) and molecular effects, and 
understand the downstream effects of RSPO4 upregulation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a two-step association study for RSPO4 with 
imputed genotypes of a German-Dutch (896 stage III-IV, grade C periodontitis 
cases, 7104 controls) and Spanish sample (441 cases and 1141 controls). We 
analysed the allelic effects on transcription factor binding sites with reporter 
gene and antibody electrophoretic mobility shift assays. We used CRISPR/dCas9 
activation and RNA sequencing to pinpoint RSPO4 as the target gene and to 
analyse downstream effects.
RESULTS: RSPO4 was associated with periodontitis (rs6056178, pmeta  = 4.6 × 10-5 
). rs6056178 contains a GATA-binding motif. The rs6056178 T-allele abolished 
reporter activity (p = .004) and reduced GATA binding (-14.5%). CRISPRa of the 
associated region increased RSPO4 expression (25.8 ± 6.5-fold, p = .003). RSPO4 
activation showed strongest induction of Gliomedin (439-fold) and Mucin 21 
(178-fold) and of the gene set "response to interferon-alpha" (area under the 
curve [AUC] = 0.8, p < 5 × 10-6 ). The most repressed gene set was 
"extracellular matrix interactions" (AUC = 0.8, padj  = .00016).
CONCLUSION: RSPO4 is a potential periodontitis risk gene and modifies host 
defence and barrier integrity.

Biochemical characterization and insights into the potency of the acidic 
Aspergillus niger NRC114 purified α-galactosidase in removing raffinose family 
oligosaccharides from soymilk yogurt.

Othman AM(1), Elshafei AM(2), Elsayed MA(2), Ibrahim GE(3), Hassan MM(2), 
Mehanna NS(4).

BACKGROUND: Because humans lack α-galactosidase, foods containing certain 
oligosaccharides from the raffinose family, such as soybeans and other legumes, 
may disrupt digestion and cause flatulence.
RESULTS: Aspergillus niger NRC114 α-galactosidase was purified using protein 
precipitation, gel filtration, and ion exchange chromatography steps, which 
resulted in a 123-fold purification. The purified enzyme was found to be 64 kDa 
using the SDS-PAGE approach. The optimum pH and temperature of the purified 
α-galactosidase were detected at pH 3.5 and 60 ºC, respectively. The pure enzyme 
exhibited potent acidic pH stability at pH 3.0 and pH 4.0 for 2 h, and it 
retained its full activity at 50 ºC and 60 ºC for 120 min and 90 min, 
respectively. The enzyme was activated using 2.5 mM of K+, Mg2+, Co2+, or Zn2+ 
by 14%, 23%, 28%, and 11%, respectively. The Km and Vmax values of the purified 
enzyme were calculated to be 0.401 µM and 14.65 μmol min-1, respectively. The 
soymilk yogurt showed an increase in its total phenolic content and total 
flavonoids after enzyme treatment, as well as several volatile compounds that 
were detected and identified using GC-MS analysis. HPLC analysis clarified the 
enzymatic action in the hydrolysis of raffinose family oligosaccharides.
CONCLUSION: The findings of this study indicate the importance of A. niger 
NRC114 α-galactosidase enzyme for future studies, especially its applications in 
a variety of biological fields.

Insight into the solvent effects on ethanol oxidation on Ir(100).

Wu R(1), Wang L(1).

Solvent effects have always been a non-negligible factor for aqueous catalytic 
reactions, though few studies have been devoted towards the molecular 
understanding and impact of solvent effects on catalysis. In this work, we 
investigated ethanol dehydrogenation and C-C bond cleavage over Ir(100) in an 
aqueous solution using density functional theory calculations with both the 
implicit and explicit solvent models and transition state theory-based kinetics 
simulations. The results show that solvent polarization assists the α- and 
β-dehydrogenation of ethanol on Ir(100) in the aqueous solution and hydrogen 
bonding also assists the ethanol β-dehydrogenation and C-C bond cleavage in 
CH2CO. The hydrogen bond between the ethanol and water molecule hinders ethanol 
hydroxyl dehydrogenation while the CHCO⋯H2O hydrogen bond radically alters the 
adsorption configuration of CHCO, which leads to an increase in the C-C cleavage 
barrier by 2.5 fold. Furthermore, the solvent changes the reaction pathways 
significantly. In an aqueous solution, ethanol β-dehydrogenation on Ir(100) is 
the dominant ethanol dehydrogenation pathway and C-C bond cleavage occurs 
predominantly via CH2CO species.

Preclinical Evaluation of (68)Ga- and (177)Lu-Labeled Integrin 
α(v)β(6)-Targeting Radiotheranostic Peptides.

Ganguly T(1), Bauer N(2), Davis RA(1), Foster CC(3), Harris RE(2), Hausner 
SH(2), Roncali E(1)(3), Tang SY(2), Sutcliffe JL(4)(2)(5).

The integrin αvβ6, an epithelium-specific cell surface receptor, is 
overexpressed on numerous malignancies, including the highly lethal pancreatic 
ductal adenocarcinomas. Here, we developed and tested a novel αvβ6-targeting 
peptide, DOTA-5G (1) radiolabeled with 68Ga, for PET/CT imaging and 177Lu for 
treatment. With the goal to develop a radiotheranostic, further modifications 
were made for increased circulation time, renal recycling, and tumor uptake, 
yielding DOTA-albumin-binding moiety-5G (2). Methods: Peptides 1 and 2 were 
synthesized on solid phase, and their affinity for αvβ6 was assessed by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The peptides were radiolabeled with 68Ga and 
177Lu. In vitro cell binding, internalization, and efflux of 68Ga-1 and 177Lu-2 
were evaluated in αvβ6-positive BxPC-3 human pancreatic cancer cells. PET/CT 
imaging of 68Ga-1 and 68Ga-2 was performed on female nu/nu mice bearing 
subcutaneous BxPC-3 tumors. Biodistribution was performed for 68Ga-1 (1 and 2 h 
after injection), 68Ga-2 (2 and 4 h after injection), and 177Lu-1 and 177Lu-2 
(1, 24, 48, and 72 h after injection). The 177Lu-2 biodistribution data were 
extrapolated for human dosimetry data estimates using OLINDA/EXM 1.1. 
Therapeutic efficacy of 177Lu-2 was evaluated in mice bearing BxPC-3 tumors. 
Results: Peptides 1 and 2 demonstrated high affinity (<55 nM) for αvβ6 by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 68Ga-1, 68Ga-2, 177Lu-1, and 177Lu-2 were 
synthesized in high radiochemical purity. Rapid in vitro binding and 
internalization of 68Ga-1 and 177Lu-2 were observed in BxPC-3 cells. PET/CT 
imaging and biodistribution studies demonstrated uptake in BxPC-3 tumors. 
Introduction of the albumin-binding moiety in 177Lu-2 resulted in a 5-fold 
increase in tumor uptake and retention over time. Based on the extended 
dosimetry data, the dose-limiting organ for 177Lu-2 is the kidney. Treatment 
with 177Lu-2 prolonged median survival by 1.5- to 2-fold versus controls. 
Conclusion: 68Ga-1 and 177Lu-2 demonstrated high affinity for the integrin αvβ6 
both in vitro and in vivo, were rapidly internalized into BxPC-3 cells, and were 
stable in mouse and human serum. Both radiotracers showed favorable 
pharmacokinetics in preclinical studies, with predominantly renal excretion and 
good tumor-to-normal-tissue ratios. Favorable human dosimetry data suggest the 
potential of 177Lu-2 as a treatment for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

Matrix Adhesiveness Regulates Myofibroblast Differentiation from Vocal Fold 
Fibroblasts in a Bio-orthogonally Cross-linked Hydrogel.

Song J(1), Gao H(1), Zhang H(1), George OJ(1), Hillman AS(2), Fox JM(1)(2), Jia 
X(1)(3)(4).

Repeated mechanical and chemical insults cause an irreversible alteration of 
extracellular matrix (ECM) composition and properties, giving rise to vocal fold 
scarring that is refractory to treatment. Although it is well known that 
fibroblast activation to myofibroblast is the key to the development of the 
pathology, the lack of a physiologically relevant in vitro model of vocal folds 
impedes mechanistic investigations on how ECM cues promote myofibroblast 
differentiation. Herein, we describe a bio-orthogonally cross-linked hydrogel 
platform that recapitulates the alteration of matrix adhesiveness due to 
enhanced fibronectin deposition when vocal fold wound healing is initiated. The 
synthetic ECM (sECM) was established via the cycloaddition reaction of tetrazine 
(Tz) with slow (norbornene, Nb)- and fast (trans-cyclooctene, TCO)-reacting 
dienophiles. The relatively slow Tz-Nb ligation allowed the establishment of the 
covalent hydrogel network for 3D cell encapsulation, while the rapid and 
efficient Tz-TCO reaction enabled precise conjugation of the cell-adhesive RGDSP 
peptide in the hydrogel network. To mimic the dynamic changes of ECM composition 
during wound healing, RGDSP was conjugated to cell-laden hydrogel constructs via 
a diffusion-controlled bioorthognal ligation method 3 days post encapsulation. 
At a low RGDSP concentration (0.2 mM), fibroblasts residing in the hydrogel 
remained quiescent when maintained in transforming growth factor beta 1 
(TGF-β1)-conditioned media. However, at a high concentration (2 mM), RGDSP 
potentiated TGF-β1-induced myofibroblast differentiation, as evidenced by the 
formation of an actin cytoskeleton network, including F-actin and alpha-smooth 
muscle actin. The RGDSP-driven fibroblast activation to myofibroblast was 
accompanied with an increase in the expression of wound healing-related genes, 
the secretion of profibrotic cytokines, and matrix contraction required for 
tissue remodeling. This work represents the first step toward the establishment 
of a 3D hydrogel-based cellular model for studying myofibroblast differentiation 
in a defined niche associated with vocal fold scarring.

Structure characterization of an exopolysaccharide from a Shiraia-associated 
bacterium and its strong eliciting activity on the fungal hypocrellin 
production.

Zhou LL(1), Shen WH(1), Ma YJ(1), Li XP(1), Wu JY(2), Wang JW(3).

Hypocrellins are fungal perylenequinones (PQs) from Shiraia fruiting bodies and 
potential photosensitizers for cancer photodynamic therapy. Shiraia fruiting 
bodies harbor diverse bacterial communities dominated by Pseudomonas. The 
present study was to characterize the exopolysaccharide (EPS) of P. fulva SB1 
which acted as an elicitor to stimulate the PQ accumulation of the host Shiraia. 
A bacterial EPS named EPS-1 was purified from the culture broth of P. fulva SB1, 
which consisted of mannose (Man) and glucose (Glc) with an average molecular 
weight of 9.213 × 104 Da. EPS-1 had (1 → 2)-linked α-mannopyranose (Manp) 
backbone and side chains of α-D-Manp-(1→ and 
α-D-Manp-(1 → 6)-β-D-Glcp-(1 → 6)-α-D-Manp(1 → group attached to the O-6 
positions of (1 → 2)-α-D-Manp. EPS-1 at 30 mg/L stimulated both intracellular 
and extracellular hypocrellin A (HA) by about 3-fold of the control group. The 
EPS-1 treatment up-regulated the expression of key genes for HA biosynthesis. 
The elicitation of HA biosynthesis by EPS-1 was strongly dependent on the 
induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. The results may provide new 
insights on the role of bacterial EPS in bacterium-fungus interactions and 
effective elicitation strategy for hypocrellin production in mycelial cultures.

Acrylic fabric and nanomaterials to enhance α-amylase-based biocatalytic 
immobilized systems for industrial food applications.

El-Shishtawy RM(1), Al Angari YM(2), Alotaibi MM(2), Almulaiky YQ(3).

An innovative approach for immobilizing α-amylase was used in this 
investigation. The acrylic fabric was first treated with hexamethylene diamine 
(HMDA) and then coated with copper ions that were later reduced to copper 
nanoparticles (CuNPs). The corresponding materials obtained, Cu(II)@HMDA-TA and 
CuNPs@HMDA-TA, were employed as carriers for α-amylase, respectively. The 
structural and morphological characteristics of the produced support matrices 
before and after immobilization were assessed using various techniques, 
including FTIR, SEM, EDX, TG/DTG, DSC, and zeta potential. The immobilized 
α-amylase exhibited the highest level of activity at pH 7.0, with immobilization 
yields observed for CuNPs@HMDA-TA (81.7 %) (60 unit/g support) followed by 
Cu(II)@HMDA-TA (71.7 %) (49 unit/g support) and 75 % and 61 % of activity 
yields, and 91.7 % and 85 % of immobilization efficiency, respectively. 
Meanwhile, biochemical characterizations of the activity of the soluble and 
immobilized enzymes were carried out and compared. Optimal temperature, pH, 
kinetics, storage stability, and reusability parameters were optimized for 
immobilized enzyme activity. The optimal pH and temperature were recorded as 6.0 
and 50 °C for soluble α-amylase while the two forms of immobilized α-amylase 
exhibit a broad pH of 6.0-7.0 and optimal temperature at 60 °C. After recycling 
15 times, the immobilized α-amylase on CuNPs@HMDA-TA and Cu(II)@HMDA-TA 
preserved 63 % and 52 % of their activities, respectively. The two forms of 
immobilized α-amylase displayed high stability when stored for 6 weeks and 
preserved 85 % and 76 % of their activities, respectively. Km values were 
calculated as 1.22, 1.39, and 1.84 mg/mL for soluble, immobilized enzymes on 
CuNPs@HMDA-TA, and Cu(II)@HMDA-TA, and Vmax values were calculated as 36.25, 
29.68, and 21.57 μmol/mL/min, respectively. The total phenolic contents of maize 
kernels improved 1.4 ± 0.01 fold after treatment by two immobilized α-amylases.

Although interest in stabilized α-helical peptides as next-generation 
therapeutics for modulating biomolecular interfaces is increasing, peptides have 
limited functionality and stability due to their small size. In comparison, 
α-helical ligands based on proteins can make steric clash with targets due to 
their large size. Here, we report the design of a monomeric pseudo-isolated 
α-helix (mPIH) system in which proteins behave as if they are peptides. The 
designed proteins contain α-helix ligands that do not require any covalent 
chemical modification, do not have frayed ends, and importantly can make 
sterically favorable interactions similar to isolated peptides. An optimal mPIH 
showed a more than 100-fold increase in target selectivity, which might be 
related to the advantages in conformational selection due to the absence of 
frayed ends. The α-helical ligand in the mPIH displayed high thermal stability 
well above human body temperature and showed reversible and rapid 
folding/unfolding transitions. Thus, mPIH can become a promising protein-based 
platform for developing stabilized α-helix pharmaceuticals.

PLG-007 and Its Active Component Galactomannan-α Competitively Inhibit Enzymes 
That Hydrolyze Glucose Polymers.

Miller MC(1), Dregni AJ(1), Platt D(2), Mayo KH(1).

PLG-007 is a developmental therapeutic compound that has been clinically shown 
to reduce the magnitude of postprandial glucose excursions and has the potential 
to be an adjunct treatment for diabetes and inflammatory-related diseases. The 
present investigation is aimed at understanding the molecular mechanism of 
action of PLG-007 and its galactomannan (GM) components GMα and GMβ (in a 1:4 
mass ratio, respectively) on enzyme (i.e., α-amylase, maltase, and lactase) 
hydrolysis of glucose polymers using colorimetric assays and 13C HSQC NMR 
spectroscopy. The starch-iodine colorimetric assay indicated that GMα strongly 
inhibits α-amylase activity (~16-fold more potent than GMβ) and thus is the 
primary active component in PLG-007. 13C HSQC experiments, used to follow the 
α-amylase-mediated hydrolysis of starch and amylopectin, further demonstrate the 
α-amylase inhibitory effect of GMα via α-amylase-mediated hydrolysis of starch 
and amylopectin. Maltohexaose (MT6) was used to circumvent the relative kinetic 
complexity of starch/amylopectin degradation in Michaelis-Menten analyses. The 
Vmax, KM, and Ki parameters were determined using peak volume integrals from 13C 
HSQC NMR spectra. In the presence of PLG-007 with α-amylase and MT6, the 
increase in KM from 7.5 ± 0.6 × 10-3 M (control) to 21 ± 1.4 × 10-3 M, with no 
significant change in Vmax, indicates that PLG-007 is a competitive inhibitor of 
α-amylase. Using KM values, Ki was estimated to be 2.1 ± 0.9 × 10-6 M; however, 
the microscopic Ki value of GMα is expected to be larger as the binding 
stoichiometry is likely to be greater than 1:1. Colorimetric assays also 
demonstrated that GMα is a competitive inhibitor of the enzymes maltase and 
lactase. Overall, this study provides insight as to how PLG-007 (GMα) is likely 
to function in vivo.

Mechanisms of cell injury induced by inhaled molybdenum trioxide nanoparticles 
in Golden Syrian Hamsters.

Huber EA(1), Cerreta JM(1).

Molybdenum trioxide nanoparticles (MoO3 NPs) are extensively used in the 
biomedical, agricultural, and engineering fields that may increase exposure and 
adverse health effects to the human population. The purpose of this study is to 
evaluate a possible molecular mechanism leading to cell damage and death 
following pulmonary exposure to inhaled MoO3 NPs. Animals were separated into 
four groups: two control groups exposed to room air or aerosolized water and two 
treated groups exposed to aerosolized MoO3 NPs with a concentration of 5 mg/m3 
NPs (4 h/day for eight days) and given a one-day (T-1) or seven-day (T-7) 
recovery period post exposure. Pulmonary toxicity was evaluated with total and 
differential cell counts. Increases were seen in total cell numbers, 
neutrophils, and multinucleated macrophages in the T-1 group, with increases in 
lymphocytes in the T-7 group (*P < 0.05). To evaluate the mechanism of toxicity, 
protein levels of Beclin-1, light chain 3 (LC3)-I/II, P-62, cathepsin B, NLRP3, 
ASC, caspase-1, interleukin (IL)-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were 
assessed in lung tissue. Immunoblot analyses indicated 1.4- and 1.8-fold 
increases in Beclin-1 in treated groups (T-1 and T-7, respectively, *P < 0.05), 
but no change in protein levels of LC3-I/II in either treated group. The levels 
of cathepsin B were 2.8- and 2.3-fold higher in treated lungs (T-1 and T-7, 
respectively, *P < 0.05), the levels of NLRP3 had a fold increase of 2.5 and 3.6 
(T-1 *P < 0.05, T-7 **P < 0.01, respectively), and the levels of caspase-1 
indicated a 3.8- and 3.0-fold increase in treated lungs (T-1 and T-7, 
respectively, *P < 0.05). Morphological changes were studied using light and 
electron microscopy showing alterations to airway epithelium and the alveoli, 
along with particle internalization in macrophages. The results from this study 
may indicate that inhalation exposure to MoO3 NPs may interrupt the autophagic 
flux and induce cytotoxicity and lung injury through pyroptosis cell death and 
activation of caspase-1.

Infectious Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 
Exhaled Aerosols and Efficacy of Masks During Early Mild Infection.

C(4), Chung HK(4), Coleman KK(5), Sapoval N(6), Treangen T(6), Berry IM(4), 
Mullins K(7), Frieman M(3), Ma T(2), Milton DK(1).

BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
epidemiology implicates airborne transmission; aerosol infectiousness and 
impacts of masks and variants on aerosol shedding are not well understood.
METHODS: We recruited coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases to give blood, 
saliva, mid-turbinate and fomite (phone) swabs, and 30-minute breath samples 
while vocalizing into a Gesundheit-II, with and without masks at up to 2 visits 
2 days apart. We quantified and sequenced viral RNA, cultured virus, and assayed 
serum samples for anti-spike and anti-receptor binding domain antibodies.
RESULTS: We enrolled 49 seronegative cases (mean days post onset 3.8 ± 2.1), May 
2020 through April 2021. We detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 36% of fine (≤5 µm), 26% 
of coarse (>5 µm) aerosols, and 52% of fomite samples overall and in all samples 
from 4 alpha variant cases. Masks reduced viral RNA by 48% (95% confidence 
interval [CI], 3 to 72%) in fine and by 77% (95% CI, 51 to 89%) in coarse 
aerosols; cloth and surgical masks were not significantly different. The alpha 
variant was associated with a 43-fold (95% CI, 6.6- to 280-fold) increase in 
fine aerosol viral RNA, compared with earlier viruses, that remained a 
significant 18-fold (95% CI, 3.4- to 92-fold) increase adjusting for viral RNA 
in saliva, swabs, and other potential confounders. Two fine aerosol samples, 
collected while participants wore masks, were culture-positive.
CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 is evolving toward more efficient aerosol generation and 
loose-fitting masks provide significant but only modest source control. 
Therefore, until vaccination rates are very high, continued layered controls and 
tight-fitting masks and respirators will be necessary.

TULP3 NLS inhibition: an in silico study to hamper cargo transport to nucleus.

Mateen RM(1), Tariq A(2), Afzal MS(1), Ali M(1), Tipu I(1), Hussain M(1), Saleem 
M(2), Naveed M(3).

TULP3 is involved in cell regulation pathways including transcription and signal 
transduction. In some pathological states like in cancers, increased level of 
TULP3 has been observed so it can serve as a potential target to hamper the 
activation of those pathways. We propose a novel idea of inhibiting nuclear 
localization signal (NLS) to interrupt nuclear translocation of TULP3 so that 
the downstream activations of pathways are blocked. In current in silico study, 
3D structure of TULP3 was modeled using 8 different tools including I-TASSER, 
CABS-FOLD, Phyre2, PSIPRED, RaptorX, Robetta, Rosetta and Prime by Schrödinger. 
Best structure was selected after quality evaluation by SAVES and implied for 
the investigation of NLS sequence. Mapped NLS sequence was further used to dock 
with natural ligand importin-α as control docking to validate the NLS sequence 
as binding site. After docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation 
validation, these residues were used as binding side for subsequent docking 
studies. 70 alkaloids were selected after intensive literature survey and were 
virtually docked with NLS sequence where natural ligand importin-α is supposed 
to be bound. This study demonstrates the virtual inhibition of NLS sequence so 
that it paves a way for future in-vivo studies to use NLS as a new drug target 
for cancer therapeutics.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

Wild-Type α-Synuclein and Variants Occur in Different Disordered Dimers and 
Pre-Fibrillar Conformations in Early Stage of Aggregation.

Guzzo A(1), Delarue P(1), Rojas A(2), Nicolaï A(1), Maisuradze GG(3), Senet 
P(1)(3).

α-Synuclein is a 140 amino-acid intrinsically disordered protein mainly found in 
the brain. Toxic α-synuclein aggregates are the molecular hallmarks of 
Parkinson's disease. In vitro studies showed that α-synuclein aggregates in 
oligomeric structures of several 10th of monomers and into cylindrical 
structures (fibrils), comprising hundred to thousands of proteins, with 
polymorphic cross-β-sheet conformations. Oligomeric species, formed at the early 
stage of aggregation remain, however, poorly understood and are hypothezised to 
be the most toxic aggregates. Here, we studied the formation of wild-type (WT) 
and mutant (A30P, A53T, and E46K) dimers of α-synuclein using coarse-grained 
molecular dynamics. We identified two principal segments of the sequence with a 
higher propensity to aggregate in the early stage of dimerization: residues 
36-55 and residues 66-95. The transient α-helices (residues 53-65 and 73-82) of 
α-synuclein monomers are destabilized by A53T and E46K mutations, which favors 
the formation of fibril native contacts in the N-terminal region, whereas the 
helix 53-65 prevents the propagation of fibril native contacts along the 
sequence for the WT in the early stages of dimerization. The present results 
indicate that dimers do not adopt the Greek key motif of the monomer fold in 
fibrils but form a majority of disordered aggregates and a minority (9-15%) of 
pre-fibrillar dimers both with intra-molecular and intermolecular β-sheets. The 
percentage of residues in parallel β-sheets is by increasing order monomer  <  
disordered dimers  <  pre-fibrillar dimers. Native fibril contacts between the 
two monomers are present in the NAC domain for WT, A30P, and A53T and in the 
N-domain for A53T and E46K. Structural properties of pre-fibrillar dimers agree 
with rupture-force atomic force microscopy and single-molecule Förster resonance 
energy transfer available data. This suggests that the pre-fibrillar dimers 
might correspond to the smallest type B toxic oligomers. The probability density 
of the dimer gyration radius is multi-peaks with an average radius that is 10 Å 
larger than the one of the monomers for all proteins. The present results 
indicate that even the elementary α-synuclein aggregation step, the 
dimerization, is a complicated phenomenon that does not only involve the NAC 
region.

High-level production of wild-type and oxidation-resistant recombinant 
alpha-1-antitrypsin in glycoengineered CHO cells.

Koyuturk I(1)(2), Kedia S(3), Robotham A(4), Star A(4), Brochu D(4), Sauvageau 
J(4), Kelly J(4), Gilbert M(4), Durocher Y(1)(2).

Alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) is a serine protease inhibitor which blocks the 
activity of serum proteases including neutrophil elastase to protect the lungs. 
Its deficiency is known to increase the risk of pulmonary emphysema as well as 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Currently, the only treatment for 
patients with A1AT deficiency is weekly injection of plasma-purified A1AT. There 
is still today no commercial source of therapeutic recombinant A1AT, likely due 
to significant differences in expression host-specific glycosylation profile 
and/or high costs associated with the huge therapeutic dose needed. Accordingly, 
we aimed to produce high levels of recombinant wild-type A1AT, as well as a 
mutated protein (mutein) version for increased oxidation resistance, with 
N-glycans analogous to human plasma-derived A1AT. To achieve this, we disrupted 
two endogenous glycosyltransferase genes controlling core α-1,6-fucosylation 
(Fut8) and α-2,3-sialylation (ST3Gal4) in CHO cells using CRISPR/Cas9 
technology, followed by overexpression of human α-2,6-sialyltransferase 
(ST6Gal1) using a cumate-inducible expression system. Volumetric A1AT 
productivity obtained from stable CHO pools was 2.5- to 6.5-fold higher with the 
cumate-inducible CR5 promoter compared to five strong constitutive promoters. 
Using the CR5 promoter, glycoengineered stable CHO pools were able to produce 
over 2.1 and 2.8 g/L of wild-type and mutein forms of A1AT, respectively, with 
N-glycans analogous to the plasma-derived clinical product Prolastin-C. 
Supplementation of N-acetylmannosamine to the cell culture media during 
production increased the overall sialylation of A1AT as well as the proportion 
of bi-antennary and disialylated A2G2S2 N-glycans. These purified recombinant 
A1AT proteins showed in vitro inhibitory activity equivalent to Prolastin-C and 
substitution of methionine residues 351 and 358 with valines rendered A1AT 
significantly more resistant to oxidation. The recombinant A1AT mutein bearing 
an improved oxidation resistance described in this study could represent a 
viable biobetter drug, offering a safe and more stable alternative for 
augmentation therapy.

Soy protein-phlorizin conjugate prepared by tyrosinase catalysis: Identification 
of covalent binding sites and alterations in protein structure and 
functionality.

Jia Y(1), Yan X(1), Li X(1), Zhang S(1), Huang Y(2), Zhang D(1), Li Y(3), Qi 
B(4).

Tyrosinase-catalyzed synthesis of soy 7S/11S-phlorizin conjugates was performed, 
and the reaction sites, conformation alterations and functional properties of 
complexes were evaluated using proteomic, in combination with multispectral 
technologies. Phlorizin was conjugated to 7S/11S primarily via residues of Lys, 
Cys, His and Arg residues. The phlorizin binding equivalents and decreased 
contents of free and total sulfhydryl groups and free amino groups confirmed the 
covalent interaction in the 7S/11S-phlorizin complexes. Conjugation with 
phlorizin promoted the conversion of α-helix to β-sheet and β-turn, with 
simultaneous transformation of the microenvironments around Trp and Tyr residues 
to hydrophilic and hydrophobic microenvironments, respectively, and lowering of 
the surface hydrophobicity of 7S/11S. The DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging 
abilities and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities of 7S/11S were increased by 
three-, two- and three-fold after the covalent binding of phlorizin. The study 
provided an ideal tyrosinase-catalyzed approach to fabricate custom-tailored 
nutritional soy protein-polyphenol products.

From Alpha to Beta - a co-translational way to fold?

Komar AA(1)(2)(3).

Comment on
    EMBO J. 2022 Feb 15;41(4):e109175.

Protein folding in the cell is largely a co-translational process occurring 
during protein synthesis on the ribosome. It has become evident that 
co-translational folding is characteristic to almost every protein in the cell 
of pro- and eukaryotic origin that are single and multidomain, single and 
multisubunit, cytosolic, secretory and membrane. Co-translational protein 
folding begins very early during the process of polypeptide chain synthesis on 
the ribosome, with some secondary structure elements forming inside the 
ribosomal tunnel and some tertiary structures forming inside the vestibule 
(lower/wider) region of the ribosomal exit tunnel. However, many details of 
co-translational folding remains incompletely understood. New data show that 
folding of a β-barrel protein begins with formation of an α-helix inside the 
ribosome that rearranges into a β-hairpin structure as the growing peptide 
reaches the wider/vestibule region of the exit tunnel. While it was previously 
suggested that such scenario can take place on the ribosome, the new data 
provide the first experimental evidence in support of this notion.

Thiol Reactivity of N-Aryl α-Methylene-γ-lactams: Influence of the Guaianolide 
Structure.

Dempe DP(1), Ji CL, Liu P(1)(2), Brummond KM(1).

The α-methylene-γ-lactam offers promise as a complementary warhead for the 
development of targeted covalent inhibitors. However, an understanding of the 
factors governing its electrophilic reactivity is needed to promote the 
development of lead compounds utilizing this motif. Herein we synthesize a 
series of N-aryl-substituted α-methylene-γ-lactams installed within the 
framework of a bioactive guaianolide analog. To determine the effects of the 
guaianolide structure on the electrophilic reactivity, these compounds were 
reacted with glutathione under biomimetic conditions, and the rate constants 
were measured. A linear free-energy relationship was observed with the Hammett 
parameter of the N-aryl group within the cis- or trans-annulated isomeric series 
of compounds. However, the trans-annulated compounds exhibited a ca. 10-fold 
increase in reactivity relative to both the cis-annulated compounds and the 
corresponding N-arylated 3-methylene-2-pyrrolidinones. Density functional theory 
calculations revealed that the reactivity of the trans-annulated stereoisomers 
is promoted by the partial release of the ring strain of the fused 
seven-membered ring in the thio-Michael addition transition state.

Passivation of Hematite by a Semiconducting Overlayer Reduces Charge 
Recombination: An Insight from Nonadiabatic Molecular Dynamics.

Wang H(1), Zhou Z(1), Long R(2), Prezhdo OV(3).

Hematite (α-Fe2O3) is a promising photoanode material for photoelectrochemical 
water splitting. Surface-passivating layers are effective in improving water 
oxidation kinetics; however, the passivation mechanism is not fully understood 
due to the complexity of interfacial reactions. Focusing on the Fe-terminated 
Fe2O3 (0001) surface that exhibits surface states in the band gap, we perform ab 
initio quantum dynamics simulations to study the effect of an α-Ga2O3 overlayer 
on charge recombination. The overlayer eliminates surface states and suppresses 
charge recombination 4-fold. This explains in part the observed cathodic shift 
in the onset potential for water oxidation. The increased charge carrier 
lifetime is an outcome of two factors, energy gap and electron-vibrational 
coupling, with a positive contribution from the former but a negative 
contribution from the latter. This work presents an advance in the atomistic 
time-domain understanding of the influence of surface passivation on charge 
recombination dynamics and provides guidance for designing novel α-Fe2O3 
photoanodes.

Enhancing the Peroxygenase Activity of a Cofactor-Independent Peroxyzyme by 
Directed Evolution Enabling Gram-Scale Epoxide Synthesis.

Sigmund MC(1), Xu G(1), Grandi E(1), Poelarends GJ(1).

Peroxygenases selectively incorporate oxygen into organic molecules making use 
of the environmentally friendly oxidant H2 O2 with water being the sole 
by-product. These biocatalysts can provide 'green' routes for the synthesis of 
enantioenriched epoxides, which are fundamental intermediates in the production 
of pharmaceuticals. The peroxyzyme 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4-OT), 
catalysing the epoxidation of a variety of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes with H2 O2 
, is outstanding because of its independence from any cost-intensive cofactor. 
However, its low-level peroxygenase activity and the decrease in the 
enantiomeric excess of the corresponding α,β-epoxy-aldehydes under 
preparative-scale conditions is limiting the potential of 4-OT. Herein we report 
the directed evolution of a tandem-fused 4-OT variant, which showed an ∼150-fold 
enhanced peroxygenase activity compared to 4-OT wild type, enabling the 
synthesis of α,β-epoxy-aldehydes in milligram- and gram-scale with high 
enantiopurity (up to 98 % ee) and excellent conversions. This engineered 
cofactor-independent peroxyzyme can provide new opportunities for the 
eco-friendly and practical synthesis of enantioenriched epoxides at large scale.

The trichloroethylene metabolite S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-l-cysteine inhibits 
lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation transcriptomic pathways and cytokine 
secretion in a macrophage cell model.

Harris SM(1), Bakulski KM(2), Dou J(3), Houskamp E(4), Scheeres EC(5), 
Schellenboom E(6), Harlow O(7), Loch-Caruso R(8), Boldenow E(9).

Studies have shown that the trichloroethylene metabolite 
S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-l-cysteine (DCVC) inhibits cytokine secretion in pathogen 
stimulated fetal membrane tissue but little is known about the mechanism for 
these effects, including which cell types or transcriptomic pathways are 
impacted. Macrophages play a critical role in fetal membrane immune responses 
during infection. We tested the hypothesis that DCVC inhibits lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS) stimulated inflammation pathways in macrophage-like THP-1 cells. We 
treated THP-1 cells for 24 h then treated with 1, 5, or 10 μM DCVC for 24 h. 
After a 4 h incubation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), we collected RNA and cell 
media. We performed transcriptomic analysis using RNA sequencing for 5 μM DCVC 
treatments and quantified cytokine release (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) for 1, 5 and 
10 μM DCVC treatments. RNA sequencing analysis revealed 1399 differentially 
expressed genes (FDR < 0.05 and log 2 fold change magnitude>2.5) in cells 
co-treated with DCVC and LPS compared to LPS alone. For example, TNF had a 
log2(fold-change) = -3.5 with the addition of DCVC. Pathways downregulated 
(adjusted p-value<0.05) in DCVC+LPS treatments versus LPS-only treatments 
included: "acute inflammatory response", "production of molecular mediator of 
immune response" and "phagocytosis". LPS increased IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α levels 
in culture media (p < 0.001), but this was inhibited by co-treatment with DCVC 
(p < 0.001 for LPS vs. LPS + DCVC treatments). Our results demonstrate that DCVC 
suppresses inflammatory responses in macrophages.

Effects of different conformations of polylysine on the anti-tumor efficacy of 
methotrexate nanoparticles.

Yu B(1), Lang X(1), Wang X(1), Ding L(1), Han M(1), Guo Y(2), Dong Z(3).

Drug delivery systems require that carrier materials have good biocompatibility, 
degradability, and constructability. Poly(amino acids), a substance with a 
distinctive secondary structure, not only have the basic features of the carrier 
materials but also have several reactive functional groups in the side chain, 
which can be employed as drug carriers to deliver anticancer drugs. The 
conformation of isomers of drug carriers has some influence on the preparation, 
morphology, and efficacy of nanoparticles. In this study, two isomers of 
polylysine, including ε-polylysine (ε-PL) and α-polylysine (α-PL), were used as 
drug carriers to entrap methotrexate (MTX) and construct nano-drug delivery 
systems. ε-PL/MTX nanoparticles with the morphology of helical nanorods 
presented a small particle size (115.0 nm), and relative high drug loading 
content (57.8 %). The anticancer effect of ε-PL/MTX nanoparticles was 1.3-fold 
and 2.6-fold stronger than that of α-PL/MTX nanoparticles in vivo and in vitro, 
respectively. ε-PL is an ideal drug carrier with potential clinical application 
prospects.

In Vitro Screening Studies on Eight Commercial Essential Oils-Derived Compounds 
to Identify Promising Natural Agents for the Prevention of Osteoporosis.

Trzaskowska M(1), Vivcharenko V(1), Kazimierczak P(1), Wolczyk A(1), Przekora 
A(1).

Over the years, essential oils (EOs) and their compounds have gained growing 
interest due to their anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant, and 
immunomodulatory properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of 
eight commercially available EO-derived compounds ((R)-(+)-limonene, 
(S)-(-)-limonene, sabinene, carvacrol, thymol, alpha-pinene (α-pinene), 
beta-pinene (β-pinene), and cinnamaldehyde) on the bone formation process in 
vitro to select the most promising natural agents that could potentially be used 
in the prevention or treatment of osteoporosis. Within this study, evaluation of 
cytotoxicity, cell proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation was performed 
with the use of mouse primary calvarial preosteoblasts (MC3T3-E1). Moreover, 
extracellular matrix (ECM) mineralization was determined using MC3T3-E1 cells 
and dog adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs). The two highest 
non-toxic concentrations of each of the compounds were selected and used for 
testing other activities. The conducted study showed that cinnamaldehyde, 
thymol, and (R)-(+)-limonene significantly stimulated cell proliferation. In the 
case of cinnamaldehyde, the doubling time (DT) for MC3T3-E1 cells was 
significantly shortened to approx. 27 h compared to the control cells (DT = 38 
h). In turn, cinnamaldehyde, carvacrol, (R)-(+)-limonene, (S)-(-)-limonene, 
sabinene, and α-pinene exhibited positive effects on either the synthesis of 
bone ECM or/and mineral deposition in ECM of the cells. Based on the conducted 
research, it can be assumed that cinnamaldehyde and (R)-(+)-limonene are the 
most promising among all tested EO-derived compounds and can be selected for 
further detailed research in order to confirm their biomedical potential in the 
chemoprevention or treatment of osteoporosis since they not only accelerated the 
proliferation of preosteoblasts, but also significantly enhanced osteocalcin 
(OC) synthesis by preosteoblasts (the OC level was approx. 1100-1200 ng/mg 
compared to approx. 650 ng/mg in control cells) and ECM calcification of both 
preosteoblasts and mesenchymal stem cells. Importantly, cinnamaldehyde treatment 
led to a three-fold increase in the mineral deposition in ADSCs, whereas 
(R)-(+)-limonene caused a two-fold increase in the ECM mineralization of both 
MC3T3-E1 cells and ADSCs.

Patel HM(2), Cho KM(6).

The chlorpyrifos-mineralizing rice root endophyte Enterobacter sp. HSTU-ASh6 
strain was identified, which enormously enhanced the growth of tomato plant 
under epiphytic conditions. The strain solubilizes phosphate and grew in 
nitrogen-free Jensen's medium. It secreted indole acetic acid (IAA; 4.8 mg/mL) 
and ACC deaminase (0.0076 μg/mL/h) and hydrolyzed chlorpyrifos phosphodiester 
bonds into 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol and diethyl methyl-monophosphate, which 
was confirmed by Gas Chromatography - Tandem Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) 
analysis. In vitro and in silico (ANI, DDH, housekeeping genes and whole genome 
phylogenetic tree, and genome comparison) analyses confirmed that the strain 
belonged to a new species of Enterobacter. The annotated genome of strain 
HSTU-ASh6 revealed a sets of nitrogen-fixing, siderophore, acdS, and IAA 
producing, stress tolerance, phosphate metabolizing, and pesticide-degrading 
genes. The 3D structure of 28 potential model proteins that can degrade 
pesticides was validated, and virtual screening using 105 different pesticides 
revealed that the proteins exhibit strong catalytic interaction with 
organophosphorus pesticides. Selected docked complexes such as α/β 
hydrolase-crotoxyphos, carboxylesterase-coumaphos, α/β hydrolase-cypermethrin, 
α/β hydrolase-diazinon, and amidohydrolase-chlorpyrifos meet their catalytic 
triads in visualization, which showed stability in molecular dynamics simulation 
up to 100 ns. The foliar application of Enterobacter sp. strain HSTU-ASh6 on 
tomato plants significantly improved their growth and development at vegetative 
and reproductive stages in fields, resulting in fresh weight and dry weight was 
1.8-2.0-fold and 1.3-1.6-fold higher in where urea application was cut by 70%, 
respectively. Therefore, the newly discovered chlorpyrifos-degrading species 
Enterobacter sp. HSTU-ASh6 could be used as a smart biofertilizer component for 
sustainable tomato cultivation.

Kappa-Carrageenan/Chitosan/Gelatin Scaffolds Provide a Biomimetic 
Microenvironment for Dentin-Pulp Regeneration.

Loukelis K(1), Machla F(2), Bakopoulou A(2), Chatzinikolaidou M(1)(3).

This study aims to investigate the impact of kappa-carrageenan on dental pulp 
stem cells (DPSCs) behavior in terms of biocompatibility and odontogenic 
differentiation potential when it is utilized as a component for the production 
of 3D sponge-like scaffolds. For this purpose, we prepared three types of 
scaffolds by freeze-drying (i) kappa-carrageenan/chitosan/gelatin enriched with 
KCl (KCG-KCl) as a physical crosslinker for the sulfate groups of 
kappa-carrageenan, (ii) kappa-carrageenan/chitosan/gelatin (KCG) and (iii) 
chitosan/gelatin (CG) scaffolds as a control. The mechanical analysis 
illustrated a significantly higher elastic modulus of the cell-laden scaffolds 
compared to the cell-free ones after 14 and 28 days with values ranging from 25 
to 40 kPa, showing an increase of 27-36%, with the KCG-KCl scaffolds indicating 
the highest and CG the lowest values. Cell viability data showed a significant 
increase from days 3 to 7 and up to day 14 for all scaffold compositions. 
Significantly increasing alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity has been observed 
over time in all three scaffold compositions, while the KCG-KCl scaffolds 
indicated significantly higher calcium production after 21 and 28 days compared 
to the CG control. The gene expression analysis of the odontogenic markers DSPP, 
ALP and RunX2 revealed a two-fold higher upregulation of DSPP in KCG-KCl 
scaffolds at day 14 compared to the other two compositions. A significant 
increase of the RunX2 expression between days 7 and 14 was observed for all 
scaffolds, with a significantly higher increase of at least twelve-fold for the 
kappa-carrageenan containing scaffolds, which exhibited an earlier ALP gene 
expression compared to the CG. Our results demonstrate that the integration of 
kappa-carrageenan in scaffolds significantly enhanced the odontogenic potential 
of DPSCs and supports dentin-pulp regeneration.

Untargeted metabolomics analysis assisted by signal selection for 
comprehensively identifying metabolites of new psychoactive substances: 
4-MeO-α-PVP as an example.

Wu HY(1), Chen YC(2), Hsu JF(3), Lu HT(2), Pan YY(4), Ma MC(4), Liao PC(2).

New psychoactive substances (NPS) have been rapidly emerged as legal 
alternatives to controlled drugs, which raised severe public health issue. The 
detection and monitoring of its intake by complete metabolic profiling is an 
urgent and vital task. Untargeted metabolomics approach has been applied for 
several NPS metabolites studies. Although the number of such works is relatively 
limited but with a rapidly growing need. The present study aimed to propose a 
procedure that includes liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry 
(LC-HRMS) analysis and a signal selection software, MetaboFinder, programed as a 
web tool. The comprehensive metabolites profile of one kind of NPS, 
4-methoxy-α-pyrrolidinovalerophenone (4-MeO-α-PVP), was studied by using this 
workflow. In this study, two different concentrations of 4-MeO-α-PVP along with 
as blank sample were incubated with human liver S9 fraction for the conversion 
to their metabolites and followed by LC-MS analysis. After retention time 
alignment and feature identification, 4640 features were obtained and submitted 
to statistical analysis for signal selection by using MetaboFinder. A total of 
50 features were considered as 4-MeO-α-PVP metabolite candidates showing 
significant changes (p < 0.00001 and fold change >2) between the two 
investigated groups. Targeted LC-MS/MS analysis was conducted focusing on these 
significantly expressed features. Assisted by chemical formula determination 
according to high mass accuracy and in silico MS2 fragmentation prediction, 19 
chemical structure identifications were achieved. Among which, 8 metabolites 
have been reported derived from 4-MeO-α-PVP in a previous literature while 11 
novel 4-MeO-α-PVP metabolites were identified by using our strategy. Further in 
vivo animal experiment confirmed that 18 compounds were 4-MeO-α-PVP metabolites, 
which demonstrated the feasibility of our strategy for screening the 4-MeO-α-PVP 
metabolites. We anticipate that this procedure may support and facilitate 
traditional metabolism studies and potentially being applied for routine NPS 
metabolites screening.

Substantiate a read-across hypothesis by using transcriptome data-A case study 
on volatile diketones.

Hansen T(1), Knebel J(1), Ritter D(1), Boei J(4), Vrieling H(4), Bitsch A(1), 
Escher SE(1).

This case study explores the applicability of transcriptome data to characterize 
a common mechanism of action within groups of short-chain aliphatic α-, β-, and 
γ-diketones. Human reference in vivo data indicate that the α-diketone diacetyl 
induces bronchiolitis obliterans in workers involved in the preparation of 
microwave popcorn. The other three α-diketones induced inflammatory responses in 
preclinical in vivo animal studies, whereas beta and gamma diketones in addition 
caused neuronal effects. We investigated early transcriptional responses in 
primary human bronchiolar (PBEC) cell cultures after 24 h and 72 h of air-liquid 
exposure. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were assessed based on 
transcriptome data generated with the EUToxRisk gene panel of Temp-O-Seq®. For 
each individual substance, genes were identified displaying a consistent 
differential expression across dose and exposure duration. The log fold change 
values of the DEG profiles indicate that α- and β-diketones are more active 
compared to γ-diketones. α-diketones in particular showed a highly concordant 
expression pattern, which may serve as a first indication of the shared mode of 
action. In order to gain a better mechanistic understanding, the resultant DEGs 
were submitted to a pathway analysis using ConsensusPathDB. The four α-diketones 
showed very similar results with regard to the number of activated and shared 
pathways. Overall, the number of signaling pathways decreased from α-to β-to 
γ-diketones. Additionally, we reconstructed networks of genes that interact with 
one another and are associated with different adverse outcomes such as fibrosis, 
inflammation or apoptosis using the TRANSPATH-database. Transcription factor 
enrichment and upstream analyses with the geneXplain platform revealed highly 
interacting gene products (called master regulators, MRs) per case study 
compound. The mapping of the resultant MRs on the reconstructed networks, 
visualized similar gene regulation with regard to fibrosis, inflammation and 
apoptosis. This analysis showed that transcriptome data can strengthen the 
similarity assessment of compounds, which is of particular importance, e.g., in 
read-across approaches. It is one important step towards grouping of compounds 
based on biological profiles.

Exponential Slope from Absolute Lymphocyte Counts during Radio-Chemotherapy Can 
Predict an Aggressive Course of Cervical Cancer.

Cho O(1), Chun M(1), Chang SJ(2).

This study aimed to investigate whether the exponential slope α from absolute 
lymphocyte counts during concurrent radio−chemotherapy (CRT) is associated with 
aggressive and non-aggressive courses of cervical cancer. We analyzed 362 
patients with stage IB−IVB cervical cancer treated with CRT in two groups: 323 
patients without mRNA data (cohort 1) and 39 with mRNA data (cohort 2) from 
plasma exosomes. We calculated the α of each patient; 69 patients who died of 
cancer in cohort 1 were divided into 44 who died within 30 months (aggressive 
group), and 25 who died after more than 30 months (non-aggressive group). The 
median follow-up periods of cohorts 1 and 2 were 63 and 28 months, respectively. 
The log2 fold change (log2FC) between read counts of mRNAs before treatment and 
after the second week of CRT was calculated. Multivariate analyses from cohort 1 
showed that neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) ≥ 2.43 and α < 0.08 were 
statistically significant predictors of disease-specific survival (DSS) in the 
aggressive group (DSS-A), whereas α ≥ 0.08 was the only significant predictor of 
DSS in the non-aggressive group (DSS-NA). The 2.5-year DSS-A and 8-year DSS-NA 
rates of patients with α ≥ 0.08 and α < 0.08 were 86.7% and 73%, and 78.5% and 
94.8% in the high-NLR group, respectively. In cohort 2, patients with both NLR < 
2.7 and α ≥ 0.07 had a higher 2.5-year DSS rate than did those with either NLR ≥ 
2.72 or α < 0.07. E2F8 and STX6 significantly correlated with ɑ and survival. 
The 2.5-year DSS rates in patients with E2F8 + STX6 (log2FC) < 0.2429 and 
≥0.2429 were 100% and 77.2%, respectively. The exponential slope α can 
potentially distinguish between aggressive and non-aggressive courses in 
cervical cancer patients.

[Automatic sleep staging based on power spectral density and random forest].

[Article in Chinese; Abstract available in Chinese from the publisher]

Gao Q(1), Wu K(2).

The method of using deep learning technology to realize automatic sleep staging 
needs a lot of data support, and its computational complexity is also high. In 
this paper, an automatic sleep staging method based on power spectral density 
(PSD) and random forest is proposed. Firstly, the PSDs of six characteristic 
waves (K complex wave, δ wave, θ wave, α wave, spindle wave, β wave) in 
electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were extracted as the classification 
features, and then five sleep states (W, N1, N2, N3, REM) were automatically 
classified by random forest classifier. The whole night sleep EEG data of 
healthy subjects in the Sleep-EDF database were used as experimental data. The 
effects of using different EEG signals (Fpz-Cz single channel, Pz-Oz single 
channel, Fpz-Cz + Pz-Oz dual channel), different classifiers (random forest, 
adaptive boost, gradient boost, Gaussian naïve Bayes, decision tree, K-nearest 
neighbor), and different training and test set divisions (2-fold 
cross-validation, 5-fold cross-validation, 10-fold cross-validation, single 
subject) on the classification effect were compared. The experimental results 
showed that the effect was the best when the input was Pz-Oz single-channel EEG 
signal and the random forest classifier was used, no matter how the training set 
and test set were transformed, the classification accuracy was above 90.79%. The 
overall classification accuracy, macro average F1 value, and Kappa coefficient 
could reach 91.94%, 73.2% and 0.845 respectively at the highest, which proved 
that this method was effective and not susceptible to data volume, and had good 
stability. Compared with the existing research, our method is more accurate and 
simpler, and is suitable for automation.

Machine-learning guided elucidation of contribution of individual steps in the 
mevalonate pathway and construction of a yeast platform strain for terpenoid 
production.

Mukherjee M(1), Blair RH(2), Wang ZQ(3).

The production of terpenoids from engineered microbes contributes markedly to 
the bioeconomy by providing essential medicines, sustainable materials, and 
renewable fuels. The mevalonate pathway leading to the synthesis of terpenoid 
precursors has been extensively targeted for engineering. Nevertheless, the 
importance of individual pathway enzymes to the overall pathway flux and final 
terpenoid yield is less known, especially enzymes that are thought to be 
non-rate-limiting. To investigate the individual contribution of the five 
non-rate-limiting enzymes in the mevalonate pathway, we created a combinatorial 
library of 243 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, each having an extra copy of 
the mevalonate pathway integrated into the genome and expressing the 
non-rate-limiting enzymes from a unique combination of promoters. 
High-throughput screening combined with machine learning algorithms revealed 
that the mevalonate kinase, Erg12p, stands out as the critical enzyme that 
influences product titer. ERG12 is ideally expressed from a medium-strength 
promoter which is the 'sweet spot' resulting in high product yield. 
Additionally, a platform strain was created by targeting the mevalonate pathway 
to both the cytosol and peroxisomes. The dual localization synergistically 
increased terpenoid production and implied that some mevalonate pathway 
intermediates, such as mevalonate, isopentyl pyrophosphate (IPP), and 
dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), are diffusible across peroxisome membranes. 
The platform strain resulted in 94-fold, 60-fold, and 35-fold improved titer of 
monoterpene geraniol, sesquiterpene α-humulene, and triterpene squalene, 
respectively. The terpenoid platform strain will serve as a chassis for 
producing any terpenoids and terpene derivatives.

Tryptophan Challenge in Healthy Controls and People with Schizophrenia: Acute 
Effects on Plasma Levels of Kynurenine, Kynurenic Acid and 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic 
Acid.

Sathyasaikumar KV(1), Notarangelo FM(1), Kelly DL(1), Rowland LM(1), Hare SM(1), 
Chen S(1), Mo C(1), Buchanan RW(1), Schwarcz R(1).

The pivotal tryptophan (TRP) metabolite kynurenine is converted to several 
neuroactive compounds, including kynurenic acid (KYNA), which is elevated in the 
brain and cerebrospinal fluid of people with schizophrenia (SZ) and may 
contribute to cognitive abnormalities in patients. A small proportion of TRP is 
metabolized to serotonin and further to 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). 
Notably, KP metabolism is readily affected by immune stimulation. Here, we 
assessed the acute effects of an oral TRP challenge (6 g) on peripheral 
concentrations of kynurenine, KYNA and 5-HIAA, as well as the cytokines 
interferon-γ, TNF-α and interleukin-6, in 22 participants with SZ and 16 healthy 
controls (HCs) using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. TRP 
raised the levels of kynurenine, KYNA and 5-HIAA in a time-dependent manner, 
causing >20-fold, >130-fold and 1.5-fold increases in kynurenine, KYNA and 
5-HIAA concentrations, respectively, after 240 min. According to multivariate 
analyses, neither baseline levels nor the stimulating effects of TRP differed 
between participants with SZ and HC. Basal cytokine levels did not vary between 
groups, and remained unaffected by TRP. Although unlikely to be useful 
diagnostically, measurements of circulating metabolites following an acute TRP 
challenge may be informative for assessing the in vivo efficacy of drugs that 
modulate the neosynthesis of KYNA and other products of TRP degradation.

Functional Validation of the Roles of Cytochrome P450s in Tolerance to 
Thiamethoxam and Imidacloprid in a Field Population of Aphis gossypii.

Lv Y(1), Wen S(1), Ding Y(1), Gao X(2), Chen X(3), Yan K(1), Yang F(1), Pan 
Y(1), Shang Q(1).

Field populations of Aphis gossypii (SDR) have evolved high resistance to 
neonicotinoids, including thiamethoxam and imidacloprid. Synergism bioassays and 
transcriptomic comparison of the SDR and susceptible (SS) strains revealed that 
the cytochrome P450s may contribute to the neonicotinoid resistance evolution. 
The transcripts of some P450s were constitutively overexpressed in the SDR 
strain, and many genes showed expression plasticity under insecticide exposure. 
Drosophila that ectopically expressed CYPC6Y9, CYP4CK1, CYP6DB1, and CYP6CZ1 
showed greater resistance (>8.0-fold) to thiamethoxam, and Drosophila that 
expressed CYPC6Y9, CYP6CY22, CYP6CY18, and CYP6D subfamily genes showed greater 
resistance (>5-fold) to imidacloprid. Five P450 genes that caused thiamethoxam 
resistance also conferred resistance to α-cypermethrin. Furthermore, the 
knockdown of CYP4CK1, CYP6CY9, CYP6CY18, CYPC6Y22, CYP6CZ1, and CYP6DB1 
dramatically increased the sensitivity of the SDR strain to thiamethoxam or 
imidacloprid. These results indicate the involvement of multiple P450 genes, 
rather than one key gene, in neonicotinoid resistance in field populations.

Recombinant Domain of Flagellin Promotes In Vitro a Chemotactic Inflammatory 
Profile in Human Immune Cells Independently of a Dendritic Cell Phenotype.

González-Stegmaier R(1), Aguirre A(1), Cárcamo C(1), Aguila-Torres P(2), 
Villarroel-Espíndola F(1).

Flagellin is the major component of the flagellum in gram-positive and -negative 
bacteria and is also the ligand for the Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5). The 
activation of TLR5 promotes the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and 
chemokines and the subsequent activation of T cells. This study evaluated a 
recombinant domain from the amino-terminus D1 domain (rND1) of flagellin from 
Vibrio anguillarum, a fish pathogen, as an immunomodulator in human peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs). We 
demonstrated that rND1 induced an upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines in 
PBMCs, characterized at the transcriptional level by an expression peak of 
220-fold for IL-1β, 20-fold for IL-8, and 65-fold for TNF-α. In addition, at the 
protein level, 29 cytokines and chemokines were evaluated in the supernatant and 
were correlated with a chemotactic signature. MoDCs treated with rND1 showed low 
levels of co-stimulatory and HLA-DR molecules and kept an immature phenotype 
with a decreased phagocytosis of dextran. We probed that rND1 from a non-human 
pathogen promotes modulation in human cells, and it may be considered for 
further studies in adjuvant therapies based on pathogen-associated patterns 
(PAMPs).

Structural modification of plum (Prunus domestica L) kernel protein isolate by 
supercritical carbon-dioxide treatment: Functional properties and in-vitro 
protein digestibility.

Sheikh MA(1), Saini CS(2), Sharma HK(3).

The effect of supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) treatment at different 
processing temperatures (30-70 °C) on the physico-functional properties, 
structural features, and in-vitro digestibility (IVPD) of plum kernel protein 
isolates (PKPI) was examined. The results revealed remarkable changes in the 
secondary structures of SC-CO2-treated PKPIs, including a decrease in α-helix 
proportion, a concomitant increase in β-sheet content, and a considerable 
variation in random coils and β-turn structures. The temperature rise increased 
the negative zeta potential to a maximum of 31.35 mV at 60 °C, exhibiting the 
colloidal stability of PKPI dispersions. SDS-PAGE analysis showed variations in 
the intensities of protein bands, indicating denaturation and aggregation at 
higher temperatures. These structural and molecular changes improved 
water-binding capacity (1.22-fold) and oil binding capacity (1.11-fold), 
wettability (1.12-fold), and the highest value in all the properties was 
recorded at 60 °C. Moreover, the highest IVPD value (21.58 %) and a 
distinguishable colour difference (∆E) of 8.11 was also obtained at 60 °C of the 
processing temperature. Therefore, SC-CO2 treatment-induced modification of PKPI 
contributed to the enhanced digestibility and techno-functional properties, 
which offered new prospects to extend its use in food applications.

Application of a fluorine strategy in the lead optimization of betulinic acid to 
the discovery of potent CD73 inhibitors.

Zhang Y(1), Yang K(2), Ye S(3), Tang W(2), Chang X(4), Wang Y(4), Wang C(2), 
Wang Y(5), Wu Y(6), Miao Z(7).

The ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73) is an important enzyme in the adenosine pathway 
and catalyzes the extracellular hydrolysis of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) 
yielding adenosine which is involved in the inflammation and immunosuppression. 
Inhibitors of CD73 have potential as novel immunotherapy agents for the 
treatment of cancer and infection. In this study, we discovered a series of 
fluorinated betulinic acid derivatives as potent CD73 inhibitors by a fluorine 
scanning strategy. Among these, three compounds ZM522, ZM553 and ZM557 exhibited 
inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 0.56 uM, 0.74 uM and 0.47 uM, 
respectively. In addition, these compounds showed a 7-fold, 5-fold and 8-fold 
increase in activity compared to the positive control drug α, β-methylene 
adenosine diphosphate (APCP) against the human CD73 enzyme. Two of these (ZM522 
and ZM553) also exhibited effective interferon gamma (INF-γ) elevation and 
indicated the regulation of rescued T cell activation. Therefore, our study 
provides both a lead optimization strategy and potential compounds for further 
development of small molecule CD73 inhibitors.

Folding-Mediated DNA Delivery by α-Helical Amphipathic Peptides.

Noble JE(1), Vila-Gómez P(1)(2), Rey S(1), Dondi C(1), Briones A(1), Aggarwal 
P(1), Hoose A(1), Baran M(1), Ryadnov MG(1)(3).

The renaissance gene therapy experiences these days requires specialist 
biomaterials and a systemic understanding of major factors influencing their 
ability to deliver genetic material. Peptide transfection systems represent a 
major class of such biomaterials. Several peptidic reagents have been 
commercialized to date. However, a comparative assessment of peptide sequences 
alone without auxiliary support or excipients against a common determinant for 
their ability to complex and deliver DNA has been lacking. This study 
cross-compares commercial and experimental transfection reagents from the same 
family of helical amphiphiles. Factors defining the efficacy of DNA delivery 
including cell uptake and gene expression are assessed along with cytotoxicity 
and DNA complexation. The results show that despite differences in sequence 
composition, length, and origin, peptide reagents of the same structural family 
exhibit similar characteristics and limitations with common variability trends. 
The cross-comparison revealed that functional DNA delivery is independent of the 
peptide sequence used but is mediated by the ability of the reagents to co-fold 
with DNA. Peptide folding proved to be the common determinant for DNA 
complexation and delivery by peptidic transfection reagents.

Tauroursodeoxycholic Acid Alleviates Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Mediated 
Visual Deficits in Diabetic tie2-TNF Transgenic Mice via TGR5 Signaling.

Lenin R(1), Jha KA(1), Gentry J(1), Shrestha A(2), Culp EV(2), Vaithianathan 
T(1)(2), Gangaraju R(1)(3).

Purpose: This study evaluated if tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) alleviates 
pro-inflammatory and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated visual deficits 
in diabetic tie2-TNF transgenic mice via Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 
(TGR5) receptor signaling. Methods: Adult tie2-TNF transgenic or age-matched 
C57BL/6J (wildtype, WT) mice were made diabetic and treated subcutaneously with 
TUDCA. After 4 weeks, visual function, vascular permeability, immunohistology, 
and molecular analyses were assessed. Human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs) 
silenced for TGR5, followed by TNF and high glucose (HG) stress-mediated 
endothelial permeability, and transendothelial migration of activated leukocytes 
were assessed with TUDCA in vitro. Results: Compared with WT mice, tie2-TNF mice 
showed a decreased visual function correlated with a decrease in protein kinase 
C α (PKCα) in rod bipolar cells, and increased vascular permeability was further 
exacerbated in diabetic-tie2-TNF mice. Conversely, TUDCA alleviated these 
changes in diabetic mice. An increase in inflammation and ER stress in retina 
coincided with an increase in TGR5 expression in diabetic tie2-TNF mice that 
decreased with TUDCA. In vitro, HRECs exposed to TNF+HG demonstrated >2-fold 
increase in TGR5 expression, a 3-fold increase in leukocyte transmigration with 
a concomitant increase in permeability. Although TUDCA reversed these effects, 
HRECs silenced for TGR5 and challenged with TUDCA or TGR5 agonist failed to 
reverse the TNF+HG induced effects. Conclusions: Our data suggest that TUDCA 
will serve as an excellent therapeutic agent for diabetic complications 
addressing both vascular and neurodegenerative changes in the retina. 
Perturbation of the TGR5 receptor in the retina might play a role in linking 
retinal ER stress to neurovascular dysfunction in diabetic retinopathy.

Seasonal Effects on Phenolic Contents and In Vitro Health-Promoting 
Bioactivities of Sacred Lotus (Nelumbo nucifera).

Sacred lotus (Nelumbo nucifera) is a commercial product in Asian countries. 
Almost all parts of the lotus plant are consumed as food or used as traditional 
medicine due to their high contents of secondary metabolites such as phenolics 
and alkaloids. However, agricultural management of the sacred lotus occurs 
during the rainy season, and the plant enters a resting stage during the dry 
season. Thus, seasonal variation (beginning, middle and end of the rainy season) 
was investigated for total phenolic contents (TPCs), antioxidant capacities and 
inhibitions of the key enzymes relevant to chronic diseases including 
Alzheimer's disease (β-secretase, acetylcholinesterase and 
butyrylcholinesterase), hypertension (angiotensin-converting enzyme), obesity 
(lipase) and diabetes (α-glucosidase) of different sacred lotus parts (seed 
embryo, petal, stamen, old leaf, leaf stalk and flower stalk). Results indicated 
that an aqueous extract of stamen in all harvesting seasons exhibited 
potentially high TPCs, which led to high antioxidant activities and most enzyme 
inhibitions (up to 53.7-fold higher) than the others collected in the same 
harvesting period. The phenolic content and biochemical activities in stamen 
harvested at the beginning of the rainy season were up to 4-fold higher than 
during other harvesting periods. This information benefits the agricultural 
management of sacred lotus and supports consumption of different sacred lotus 
parts for health promotion. Results can be used as an initial database for 
future product development from different sacred lotus parts.

Exercise training attenuates pulmonary inflammation and mitochondrial 
dysfunction in a mouse model of high-fat high-carbohydrate-induced NAFLD.

Cho J(1)(2), Johnson BD(1), Watt KD(3), Niven AS(4), Yeo D(1), Kim CH(5).

BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) can lead to pulmonary 
dysfunction that is associated with pulmonary inflammation. Moreover, little is 
known regarding the therapeutic role of exercise training on pulmonary 
pathophysiology in NAFLD. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of 
exercise training on high-fat high-carbohydrate (HFHC)-induced pulmonary 
dysfunction in C57BL/6 mice.
METHODS: Male C57BL/6 mice (N = 40) were fed a standard Chow (n = 20) or an HFHC 
(n = 20) diet for 15 weeks. After 8 weeks of dietary treatment, they were 
further assigned to 4 subgroups for the remaining 7 weeks: Chow (n = 10), Chow 
plus exercise (Chow+EX, n = 10), HFHC (n = 10), or HFHC plus exercise (HFHC+EX, 
n = 10). Both Chow+EX and HFHC+EX mice were subjected to treadmill running.
RESULTS: Chronic exposure to the HFHC diet resulted in obesity with hepatic 
steatosis, impaired glucose tolerance, and elevated liver enzymes. The HFHC 
significantly increased fibrotic area (p &lt; 0.001), increased the mRNA 
expression of TNF-α (4.1-fold, p &lt; 0.001), IL-1β (5.0-fold, p &lt; 0.001), 
col1a1 (8.1-fold, p &lt; 0.001), and Timp1 (6.0-fold, p &lt; 0.001) in the lung 
tissue. In addition, the HFHC significantly altered mitochondrial function (p 
&lt; 0.05) along with decreased Mfn1 protein levels (1.8-fold, p &lt; 0.01) and 
increased Fis1 protein levels (1.9-fold, p &lt; 0.001). However, aerobic 
exercise training significantly attenuated these pathophysiologies in the lungs 
in terms of ameliorating inflammatory and fibrogenic effects by enhancing 
mitochondrial function in lung tissue (p &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The current findings suggest that exercise training has a 
beneficial effect against pulmonary abnormalities in HFHC-induced NAFLD through 
improved mitochondrial function.

Galectins are critical regulators of cytokine signalling at feto-maternal 
interface in infection-associated spontaneous preterm birth.

Bhati T(1), Ray A(2), Arora R(3), Siraj F(4), Parvez S(5), Rastogi S(6).

INTRODUCTION: Spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) is a global health issue. Studies 
suggest infections are chiefly associated with sPTB and galectins (gals) play a 
role in regulation of innate and adaptive maternal immune response against 
pathogens during sPTB. The aim of this study was to describe the gene expression 
of gal -1, -3, -8, -9, -13 in relation to gene expression of cyclooxygenase-2 
(COX-2) and the cytokines IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α, IFN-ϒ in the setting of sPTB and 
confirmed infection with Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma hominis, and 
Ureaplasma urealyticum.
METHODS: Placental samples were collected from 120 term control and 120 sPTB 
pregnancies. PCR was used to detect specific pathogens. Gene expression of 
galectins, cytokines, and COX-2 was performed using real time qPCR.
RESULTS: Fold-change expression of gal -1, -3, -8, -9, -13 was 5.13, 6.11, 1.14, 
5.23 and 7.16 (p<0.001), respectively; while IL-10, IL-8, TNF-α, IFN-ϒ and COX-2 
was 6.29, 6.55, 6.35, 6.36 and 2.73-fold upregulated (p<0.05), respectively in 
infected sPTB. Gal-1 was positively correlated with IL-10 (r=0.49, p=0.003) 
while gal-3 showed significant correlation with IL-8 (r=0.42, p=0.0113), TNF-α 
(r=0.65, p=< 0.001) and COX-2 (r=0.72, p=0.001). However, gal-8 was not 
significantly correlated with any cytokine. Gal-9, -13 were negatively 
correlated with IFN-ϒ (r=-0.45, p=0.006) and IL-8 (r=-0.39, p=0.018).
DISCUSSION: Gal-1, -9, -13 are anti-inflammatory and might play role in 
immune-tolerance while gal-3 is pro-inflammatory and possibly responsible for 
immunogenic response, having potential to anticipate the clinical beginning of 
preterm labour during infection.

Association of α-klotho with subclinical carotid atherosclerosis in subjects 
with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Castelblanco E(1)(2), Hernández M(3), Alonso N(4)(5)(6), Ribes-Betriu A(7), Real 
J(2)(4), Granado-Casas M(4)(7)(8), Rossell J(4)(7)(8), Rojo-López MI(7)(8), 
Dusso AS(1), Julve J(9)(10)(11), Mauricio D(12)(13)(14)(15).

BACKGROUND: Compelling evidence suggests that the fibroblast growth factor 23 
(FGF23) / α-klotho axis is impaired in subjects with diabetes mellitus. We 
examined the relationship between parameters related to calcium/phosphate 
homeostasis, including FGF23 and α-klotho, and subclinical carotid 
atherosclerosis burden in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) subjects.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved 226 subjects with T1D and 147 age-, 
sex- and plaque-matched, non-diabetic (non-T1D) subjects, both with normal renal 
function. Carotid ultrasound was performed to determine the presence and burden 
of atheromatous plaques. Concentrations of the intact form of FGF23 and α-klotho 
were assessed by ELISA. Calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D 
levels were also determined. Negative binomial regression models were used to 
examine relationship between parameters studied and subclinical carotid 
atherosclerosis.
RESULTS: Only FGF23 was increased in T1D compared with non-diabetic subjects 
(> 2-fold; p < 0.05). α-klotho was higher in subjects with subclinical carotid 
atherosclerosis (1.4-fold, p < 0.05). Regression analysis revealed that the log 
α-klotho concentration was positively associated with the presence of 
subclinical carotid atherosclerosis both in T1D subjects (incidence rate ratio 
[IRR]: 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-1.89; p < 0.05) and in non-T1D 
subjects (IRR: 1.65; 95% CI, 1.02-2.75; p < 0.05). The models also showed that 
age, smoking and albuminuria-to-creatinine ratio were positively associated with 
subclinical carotid atherosclerosis in T1D subjects. Interestingly, sex-related 
protection against plaque was also revealed in T1D women.
CONCLUSION: Higher α-klotho was associated with subclinical carotid 
atherosclerotic in the absence of kidney dysfunction. This finding also points 
to a new pathophysiological pathway involved in the development and progression 
of this complication.

The Effect of Clomiphene Citrate and Letrozole in Apoptotic Pathways and Cell 
Cycle in Human Primary Cumulus Cells and the Protective Effect of Estradiol.

Silveira CO(1)(2), Oliveira RM(3), Moraes LM(4), Oliveira GG(4), Aguiar LPT(4), 
Souza FHS(3), Coelho SS(3), Prazeres PHDM(3), Del Puerto HL(3), Ferreira MCF(5).

Clomiphene citrate (CC) and letrozole are ovulatory stimulants that, despite 
high ovulation rates, achieve low pregnancy rates. This study aimed to 
investigate the in vitro effects of CC and letrozole, alone or in combination 
with estradiol, on apoptosis in human cumulus cells. We performed a controlled 
prospective study using primary cumulus cell cultures from patients undergoing 
in vitro fertilization (n=22). Alpha-inhibin immunocytochemistry was used to 
assess cell culture purity and morphology. Cell viability was evaluated by MTT 
assay, cell cycle status by flow cytometry, and Caspase-3, Bax and SOD-2, and 
S26 gene expression by qPCR. Cells were treated for 24 hours in 5 conditioned 
media: CC, CC + estradiol, letrozole, letrozole + estradiol and control. None of 
the treatments affected cell viability, but letrozole reduced the mean 
percentage of cells in the S phase compared to control (24.79 versus 21.70, 
p=0.0014). Clomiphene treatment increased mRNA expression of Bax (4 fold) and 
SOD-2 (2 fold), which was reversed by co-treatment with estradiol. SOD-2 
expression increased in cells treated with letrozole compared to control (4 
fold), which was also reversed by estradiol. These findings suggest that 
clomiphene citrate and letrozole do not significantly affect the viability of 
human cumulus cells. Still, the expression of genes involved in apoptosis was 
modulated by these drugs alone and in association with estradiol, suggesting 
that CC and letrozole may have direct effects on cumulus cells beyond their 
known mechanisms of action.

Catalpol relieved angiotensin II-induced blood-brain barrier destruction via 
inhibiting the TLR4 pathway in brain endothelial cells.

Xia Y(1), Lu YW(1), Hao RJ(1), Yu GR(1).

CONTEXT: Catalpol is a major bioactive constituent of Rehmannia glutinosa 
Libosch (Scrophulariaceae), a traditional Chinese medicine, which is widely used 
in multiple diseases, including hypertension.
OBJECTIVES: To explore whether catalpol protects against angiotensin II (Ang 
II)-triggered blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The bEnd.3 cells and BBB models were pre-treated with or 
without catalpol (50, 200 and 500 μM) or TAK-242 (1 μM) for 2 h and then with 
Ang II (0.1 μM) or LPS (1 μg/mL) for 24 h. Cell viability was determined by the 
MTT assay. The levels of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation 
factor 88 (MyD88), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), tumour necrosis 
factor-α (TNF-α), caveolin-1 (Cav-1) and p-eNOS/eNOS were tested by western 
blot. The BBB permeability was evaluated by the flux of bovine serum 
albumin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (BSA-FITC) across monolayers. nuclear factor 
kappa-B (NF-κB) p65 nuclear translocation was explored by immunofluorescence 
staining.
RESULTS: Ang II (0.1 μM) decreased the cell viability to 86.52 ± 1.79%, elevated 
the levels of TLR4, MyD88, iNOS, TNF-α and Cav-1 respectively to 3.7-, 1.5-, 
2.3-, 2.2- and 2.7-fold, reduced the level of p-eNOS/eNOS to 1.6-fold in bEnd.3 
cells, and eventually increased BBB permeability. Catalpol dose-dependently 
reversed these changes at 50-500 μM. Meanwhile, catalpol (500 μM) inhibited the 
upregulated levels of TLR4 pathway-related proteins and NF-κB p65 nuclear 
translocation, decreased the enhanced transcytosis, and relieved the BBB 
disruption caused by both LPS (the TLR4 activator) and Ang II. The effects are 
same as TAK-242 (the TLR4 inhibitor).
CONCLUSIONS: Catalpol relieved the Ang II-induced BBB damage, which indicated 
catalpol has high potential for the treatment of hypertension-induced cerebral 
small vessel disease (cSVD).

Improved Hydrolysis of Granular Starches by a Psychrophilic α-Amylase Starch 
Binding Domain-Fusion.

Wang Y(1), Tian Y(2), Zhong Y(2), Suleiman MA(1), Feller G(3), Westh P(4), 
Blennow A(2), Møller MS(5), Svensson B(1).

Degradation of starch granules by a psychrophilic α-amylase, AHA, from the 
Antarctic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAB23 was facilitated by 
C-terminal fusion to a starch-binding domain (SBD) from either Aspergillus niger 
glucoamylase (SBDGA) or Arabidopsis thaliana glucan, water dikinase 3 (SBDGWD3) 
via a decapeptide linker. Depending on the waxy, normal or high-amylose starch 
type and the botanical source, the AHA-SBD fusion enzymes showed up to 3 times 
higher activity than AHA wild-type. The SBD-fusion thus increased the density of 
enzyme attack-sites and binding-sites on the starch granules by up to 5- and 
7-fold, respectively, as measured using an interfacial catalysis approach that 
combined conventional Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with the substrate in excess, 
and inverse kinetics, having enzyme in excess, with enzyme-starch granule 
adsorption isotherms. Higher substrate affinity of the SBDGA compared to SBDGWD3 
was accompanied by the superior activity of AHA-SBDGA in agreement with the 
Sabatier principle of adsorption limited heterogenous catalysis.

A new oleanane-skeleton triterpene isolated from Coffea canephora.

Hoang MH(1), Nguyen TAT(2), Pham NKT(3), Dang VS(4), Vo TN(1).

Extensive fractionation of n-hexane extract from the dried powdered-trunks of 
Coffea canephora Pierre ex A.Froehner (Rubiaceae) led to the isolation of a new 
oleanane-skeleton triterpene, coffecanolic acid (1), along with three known 
analogues sumaresinolic acid (2), oleanolic acid (3), and 3-O-acetyloleanolic 
acid (4). The chemical structures were elucidated using FT-IR, 1D and 2D NMR and 
HR-ESI-MS data analysis. The isolated compounds were assayed for in vitro 
α-glucosidase inhibitory activity by determining their half-maximal inhibitory 
concentration (IC50, µM). Compounds 1-4 exhibited higher inhibitory activities 
when compared with acarbose, a positive control. Compound 1 was found to be the 
most potent molecule against α-glucosidase, with the IC50 = 83.0 ± 1.2 µM, which 
improved by 2.5-fold over acarbose (IC50 = 209.8 ± 0.3 µM) in this 
assay.[Formula: see text].

Biological Evaluation of the Antibacterial Retinoid CD437 in Cutibacterium acnes 
Infection.

Acne vulgaris is a complex skin disease involving infection by Cutibacterium 
acnes, inflammation, and hyperkeratinization. We evaluated the activity of the 
retinoid 6-[3-(adamantyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl]-2-naphthalene carboxylic acid (CD437) 
and 16 other retinoid analogs as potential anti-C. acnes compounds and found 
that CD437 displayed the highest antimicrobial activity with an MIC against C. 
acnes (ATCC 6919 and HM-513) of 1 μg/mL. CD437 demonstrated an MBC of 2 μg/mL 
compared to up to 64 μg/mL for the retinoid adapalene and up to 16 μg/mL for 
tetracycline, which are commonly used clinically to treat acne. Membrane 
permeability assays demonstrated that exposure of C. acnes ATCC 6919 to CD437 
damaged the integrity of C. acnes ATCC 6919 bacterial membranes, and this 
finding was confirmed with scanning electron microscopy. Additionally, CD437 
downregulated the expression of C. acnes ATCC 6919 virulence factors, including 
the genes encoding Christie-Atkins-Munch-Petersen factor 1 (CAMP1), CAMP2, 
glycerol-ester hydrolase B (GehB), sialidase B, and neuraminidase. In a mouse 
skin infection model of C. acnes ATCC 6919, topical treatment with CD437 
ameliorated skin lesions and reduced the bacterial burden in situ (P < 0.001). 
In human NHEK primary cells, CD437 reduced the transcriptional levels of the 
coding genes for inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1α, ~10-fold; 
interleukin-6, ~20-fold; interleukin-8, ~30-fold; and tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha, ~6-fold) and downregulated the transcriptional levels of KRT10 
(~10-fold), FLG (~4-fold), and TGM1 (~2-fold), indicating that CD437 can 
diminish inflammation and hyperkeratinization. In summary, CD437 deserves 
further attention for its dual function as a potential acne therapeutic that 
potentially acts on both the pathogen and the host.

A penetratin-derived peptide reduces the membrane permeabilization and cell 
toxicity of α-synuclein oligomers.

A(5), Strømgaard K(4), Andreasen M(6), Sharma D(7), Saboury AA(8), Otzen DE(9).

Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative movement disorder associated with the 
intracellular aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn). Cytotoxicity is mainly 
associated with the oligomeric species (αSOs) formed at early stages in α-syn 
aggregation. Consequently, there is an intense focus on the discovery of novel 
inhibitors such as peptides to inhibit oligomer formation and toxicity. Here, 
using peptide arrays, we identified nine peptides with high specificity and 
affinity for αSOs. Of these, peptides p194, p235, and p249 diverted α-syn 
aggregation from fibrils to amorphous aggregates with reduced β-structures and 
increased random coil content. However, they did not reduce αSO cytotoxicity and 
permeabilization of large anionic unilamellar vesicles. In parallel, we 
identified a non-self-aggregating peptide (p216), derived from the 
cell-penetrating peptide penetratin, which showed 12-fold higher binding 
affinity to αSOs than to α-syn monomers (Kdapp 2.7 and 31.2 μM, respectively). 
p216 reduced αSOs-induced large anionic unilamellar vesicle membrane 
permeability at 10-1 to 10-3 mg/ml by almost 100%, was not toxic to SH-SY5Y 
cells, and reduced αSOs cytotoxicity by about 20%. We conclude that p216 is a 
promising starting point from which to develop peptides targeting toxic αSOs in 
Parkinson's disease.

Effects of RETN polymorphisms on treatment response in rheumatoid arthritis 
patients receiving TNF-α inhibitors and utilization of machine-learning 
algorithms.

J(2), Hee Kim J(3), Jung JY(4), Kim J(5), Kim HA(6), Eun Lee K(7).

This study was designed to investigate the effects of polymorphisms in RETN on 
remission in RA patients receiving TNF-α inhibitors. In addition, machine 
learning algorithms were trained to predict remission. Ten single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms were investigated. Univariate and multivariable analyses were 
performed to evaluate associations between genetic polymorphisms and the 
efficacy of TNF-α inhibitors. A random forest-based classification approach was 
used to assess the importance of different variables associated with the 
efficacy of TNF-α inhibitors. Various machine learning methods were used for 
finding vital factors and prediction of remission. The eight most significant 
features included in the multivariable analysis were sex, age, hypertension, 
sulfasalazine, rs1862513, rs3219178, rs3219177, and rs3745369. T-allele carriers 
of rs3219177 and males showed approximately 6.0- and 3.6-fold higher remission 
rates compared to those with the CC genotype and females, respectively. The 
elastic net algorithm was the best machine-learning method for predicting 
remission of patients with RA treated with TNF-α inhibitors. On the basis of the 
results of this study, it may be possible to design individually tailored 
treatment regimens to predict the efficacy of TNF-α inhibitors.

Roflumilast alleviates adenine-induced chronic kidney disease by regulating 
inflammatory biomarkers.

Patel P(1), Patel S(2), Chudasama P(3), Soni S(4), Raval M(5).

The present investigation was carried out to explore the role of roflumilast, a 
PDE4 inhibitor, as a potential treatment option for chronic kidney disease. 
Forty-six male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: Control, Disease 
control (50 mg/kg Adenine p.o.), Adenine + Roflumilast (0.5, 1 and 1.5 mg/kg, 
p.o.). Various urinary and serum biomarkers, antioxidant status, histopathology, 
and protein expression of inflammatory markers were measured to investigate the 
effects of roflumilast on kidney functions. Adenine was found to elevate the 
levels of serum creatinine, urea, uric acid, sodium, potassium, chloride, 
magnesium, and phosphorus and reduce the level of serum calcium. Further, 
adenine significantly increased the serum TGF-β levels and reduced the 
anti-oxidant indices. Significant elevation was observed in protein expression 
of IL-1β, TNF-α, MCP-1, ICAM-1, and Fibronectin. Histopathologically, adenine 
caused thickening of the glomerular basement membrane, inflammatory cells 
infiltration, atrophy, and glomeruli deterioration. However, Roflumilast 
administration (1 mg/kg) remarkably decrease serum creatinine, urea, uric acid, 
sodium, potassium, chloride, magnesium, phosphorus by 61%, 40%, 44%, 41%, 49%, 
58%, 59% and 42% respectively, and increase in calcium by 158%. Moreover, 
Roflumilast (1 mg/kg) significantly reduced serum TGF-β levels by 50% and 
elevated anti-oxidant indices by 257%, 112%, and 60%, respectively. The protein 
expression was significantly reduced by 5.5-fold, 7-fold, 5.7-fold, 6.2-fold, 
and 5.1-fold individually. Roflumilast noticeably improved the structure of 
glomeruli, tubules, and cellular functioning. The study confirmed that 
Roflumilast has the potential to ameliorate renal injury by reducing and 
regulating inflammatory responses.

Functional dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 3C-like protease as a member of clan PA.

Kidera A(1), Moritsugu K(1)(2), Ekimoto T(1), Ikeguchi M(1).

SARS-CoV-2 3C-like protease (3CLpro), a potential therapeutic target for 
COVID-19, consists of a chymotrypsin fold and a C-terminal α-helical domain 
(domain III), the latter of which mediates dimerization required for catalytic 
activation. To gain further understanding of the functional dynamics of 
SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, this review extends the scope to the comparative study of 
many crystal structures of proteases having the chymotrypsin fold (clan PA of 
the MEROPS database). First, the close correspondence between the zymogen-enzyme 
transformation in chymotrypsin and the allosteric dimerization activation in 
SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro is illustrated. Then, it is shown that the 3C-like proteases 
of family Coronaviridae (the protease family C30), which are closely related to 
SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, have the same homodimeric structure and common activation 
mechanism via domain III mediated dimerization. The survey extended to order 
Nidovirales reveals that all 3C-like proteases belonging to Nidovirales have 
domain III, but with various chain lengths, and 3CLpro of family Mesoniviridae 
(family C107) has the same homodimeric structure as that of C30, even though 
they have no sequence similarity. As a reference, monomeric 3C proteases 
belonging to the more distant family Picornaviridae (family C3) lacking domain 
III are compared with C30, and it is shown that the 3C proteases are rigid 
enough to maintain their structures in the active state.

Selective decrease in alpha1-antitrypsin levels in diabetic retinopathy: Could 
the levels of it be playing a role in the pathophysiology of diabetic 
retinopathy?

Kunder M(1), Lakshmaiah V(2), Moideen Kutty AV(1).

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is known to induce 
inflammation and activation of neutrophils causing the release of neutrophil 
elastase (NE), a pro-inflammatory proteinase. The activity of NE is regulated by 
endogenous inhibitors alpha1-antitrypsin (α1-AT) and alpha2-macroglobulin 
(α2-MG). Disrupted proteolytic homeostasis in T2DM patients is one of the causes 
for vascular complications. This study was carried out for evaluating the levels 
of plasma NE, α1-AT, α2-MG and NE-α1-AT complex to understand their roles in the 
pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy (DN) and diabetic retinopathy (DR).
METHODS: A total of 240 participants (Control, n=60; T2DM, n=60; DN, n=60; and 
DR, n=60) were recruited after recording history, clinical examination and 
laboratory investigations. Retinopathy was confirmed by fundoscopy and 
nephropathy by urinary albumin excretion and serum creatinine levels. NE was 
measured using STANA. α1-AT, α2-MG and NE-α1-AT complex were estimated by ELISA.
RESULTS: Baseline clinical and laboratory findings were confirmatory to the 
study groups. The mean elastase activity was higher (P<0.0005) in diabetes 
groups (T2DM=0.73±0.31, DN=0.87±0.35, DR=0.76±0.41) than controls (0.35±0.20). 
The levels of α1-AT were lower in DR (8.77±2.85) than DN (26.26±6.16) and T2DM 
(41.13±14.06) when juxtaposed with controls (122.95±25.71). The approximate fold 
decrease of α1-AT levels was 15 for DR and four for DN compared to controls. The 
levels of α2-MG were lowered in T2DM (167.29±30.45), DN (144.66±13.72), and DR 
(104.67±11.47) than controls (208.87±31.16). The NE-α1-AT complex levels were: 
controls (215.83±13.61), T2DM (98.85±23.85), DN (129.26±20.40) and DR 
(153.25±17.11).
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Homeostasis of NE, α1-AT and α2-MG is disrupted in 
T2DM, DN and DR. Strikingly reduced levels of α1-AT observed in DR are 
indicative of its possible role in the pathophysiology of retinopathy and 
emphasizes α1-AT as a plausible therapeutic target.

A practical approach to producing the single-arm linear dextrin, a chimeric 
glucosaccharide containing an (α-1 → 4) linked portion at the nonreducing end of 
an (α-1 → 6) glucochain.

Wu Y(1), Li X(1), Jin Z(1), Svensson B(2), Bai Y(3).

How to improve the solubility of linear dextrins (LD) and retain their 
characteristic helix amphiphilic cavities with flexible embedding capability, is 
a question worth exploring without adding new chemical groups. The strategy 
presented in this study is to attach a highly flexible (α-1 → 6) glucochain at 
the reducing end of LD by preparing a new type of dextrin, referred to as 
single-arm linear dextrin (SLD). In the actual synthesis, an (α-1 → 6) linked 
oligosaccharide of DP¯ 10.7 (PDI = 1.28) was formed by extension of glucose 
units onto sucrose (2 M) by using L940W mutant of the glucansucrase GTF180-ΔN 
firstly. Next using γ-CD as glucosylation donor γ-CGTase extended this (α-1 → 6) 
glucochain with (α-1 → 4) bonds. SLD is a chimeric glucosaccharide comprising an 
(α-1 → 4) linked part (DP¯ 10.5) attached to the nonreducing end of an (α-1 → 6) 
glucochain as verified by enzyme fingerprinting and 1H NMR. Furthermore, SLD was 
validated to show greatly improved solubility and dispersibility of resveratrol 
in water, as indicated by a 3.12-fold enhancement over the solubility in the 
presence of 0.014 M SLD. This study provided a new strategy for solving the 
solubility problem of LD and opens possibilities for new design of the fine 
structure of starch-like materials.

Predictive value of immunological markers after bacille Calmette-Guérin 
induction in bladder cancer.

ET(1), Zidan AA(2), Zahran MH(1), Shokeir AA(1), Awadalla A(1).

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the predictive value of different immunological 
markers on treatment outcomes after bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) induction in 
high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients who underwent transurethral resection of bladder 
tumour for NMIBC were assessed for study eligibility. Urine and blood samples 
were taken from patients at baseline (immediately before first dose of 
induction) and after induction (4 h after last [sixth] dose). Urine samples were 
evaluated for interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-10 by solid-phase enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay. Blood samples were evaluated for tumour necrosis factor α 
(TNF-α), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and transcription factors 
(TFs) (GATA-binding protein 3 [GATA3], T-box expressed in T cells [T-bet], and 
forkhead box protein 3 [FoxP3]) using quantitative reverse 
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis. Change pattern and fold change 
of each evaluable marker was assessed in relation to different treatment 
outcomes (initial complete response [ICR]/recurrence/progression).
RESULTS: Between July 2013 and May 2019, 204 patients were included. Among 
evaluable markers, urinary IL-2 and serum TNF-α increased in all patients, serum 
CTLA-4 and FoxP3+ showed a predominant decreased pattern in 188 (92.2%) and 192 
(94.1%) patients, respectively. An ICR was achieved in 186 (91.2%) patients. 
Serum TNF-α fold change and urinary IL-10 change pattern were significantly 
associated with an ICR (P = 0.001 and P = 0.03, respectively). At a median 
(range) follow-up of 37 (20-88) months, 104 (56%) patients developed recurrence. 
Urinary IL-10, serum CTLA-4, T-bet+ , FoxP3+ change patterns and GATA3+ /T-bet+ 
ratio were significantly associated with tumour recurrence (P = 0.001, 
P = 0.001, P = 0.02, P = 0.009 and P = 0.001, respectively). Tumour progression 
occurred in 34 (18.3%) patients. Urinary IL-10, serum CTLA-4, serum T-bet+ 
change patterns and GATA3+ /T-bet+ ratio were independent predictors of tumour 
progression (P = 0.001, P = 0.001, P = 0.02 and P = 0.001, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Urinary IL-10 and serum TNF-α can significantly predict ICR. 
Moreover, change pattern of urinary IL-10, serum CTLA-4, TFs (GATA3, T-bet and 
FoxP3) and GATA3+ /T-bet+ ratio after BCG induction can independently predict 
further BCG response. These markers could be implemented in clinical practice 
when management options are discussed or in systems with severe BCG shortage.

In Vivo evaluation of newly synthesized (213)Bi-conjugated alpha-melanocyte 
stimulating hormone (α-MSH) peptide analogues in melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1-R) 
positive experimental melanoma model.

Given the rising pervasiveness of melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1-R) positive 
melanoma malignum (MM) and pertinent metastases, radiolabelled receptor-affine 
alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone-analogue (α-MSH analogue) imaging probes 
would be of crucial importance in timely tumor diagnostic assessment. Herein we 
aimed at investigating the biodistribution and the MM targeting potential of 
newly synthesized 213Bi-conjugated MC1-R specific peptide-based radioligands 
with the establishment of MC1-R overexpressing MM preclinical model. 
DOTA-conjugated NAP, -HOLD, -FOLD, -and MARSamide were labelled with 213Bi. Ex 
vivo biodistribution studies were conducted post-administration of 3.81 ± 0.32 
MBq [213Bi]Bi-DOTA conjugated deriva-tives into twenty B16-F10 tumor-bearing 
C57BL/6 J and healthy mice. Organ Level Internal Dose Assessment (OLINDA) and 
IDAC-Dose were used to calculate translational data-based absorbed radiation 
dose in human organs. Moderate or low %ID/g uptake of [213Bi]Bi-DOTA conjugated 
NAP, -HOLD, -and MARSamide and significantly increased [213Bi]Bi-DOTA-FOLDamide 
accumulation was observed in the thoracic and abdominal organs (p ≤ 0.01). High 
[213Bi]Bi-DOTA-NAP (%ID/g:3.76 ± 0.96), -and FOLDamide (%ID/g:3.28 ± 0.95) tumor 
tracer activity confirmed their MC1-R-affinity. The bladder wall received the 
highest radiation absorbed dose followed by the kidneys (bladder wall: 1.95·10-2 
and 8.97·10-2 mSv/MBq; kidneys: 7.47·10-3 vs. 5.88·10-2 mSv/MBq measured by IDAC 
and OLINDA; respectively) indicating the suitability of the NAPamide derivative 
for clinical use. These novel [213Bi]Bi-DOTA-linked peptide probes displaying 
meaningful MC1-R affinity could be promising molecular probes in MM imaging.

SK(1)(3), Cho S(3)(4), Choi YS(1)(3), Lee BS(1)(3), Park J(5), Lee S(6), Lee 
KR(5), Yun BH(1)(7).

BACKGROUND: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are reportedly associated 
with repeated abortion. Thus, genetic analysis based on race is the key to 
developing accurate diagnostic tests. This study analyzed the genetic 
polymorphisms of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) patients among Korean women 
compared to the controls.
METHODS: In 53 women of RPL group and 50 controls, the genetic analysis was 
performed. The genotype distribution and allele frequency were analyzed 
statistically for the difference between the two groups. The association between 
each SNP marker and RPL risk was analyzed.
RESULTS: The genotypes of LEPR, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), KDR, 
miR-27a, miR-449b, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) were analyzed using 
odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Only the AG genotype of 
miR-449b (A>G) polymorphism showed significant association with the risk of RPL 
when compared to the AA genotype (OR, 2.39). The combination of GG/AG+GG/CA+AA 
genotypes for eNOS/miR-449b/TNF-α was associated with 7.36-fold higher risk of 
RPL (OR, 7.36). The GG/AG+GG combination for eNOS/miR-449b showed 2.43-fold 
higher risk for RPL (OR, 2.43). The combination of AG+GG/CA+AA genotypes for 
miR-449b/TNF-α showed a significant association with the risk of RPL (OR, 7.60). 
From the haplotype-based analysis, the G-G-A haplotype of eNOS/miR-449b/TNF-α 
and the G-A haplotype of miR-449b/TNF-α were associated with increased risk of 
RPL (OR, 19.31; OR, 22.08, respectively).
CONCLUSION: There is a significant association between the risk of RPL and 
miR-449b/TNF-α combination, and therefore, genetic analysis for specific 
combined genotypes can be an important screening method for RPL in Korean women.

Emulation of the structure of the Saposin protein fold by a lung surfactant 
peptide construct of surfactant Protein B.

Waring AJ(1)(2), Whitelegge JP(3), Sharma SK(4), Gordon LM(1), Walther FJ(1)(5).

The three-dimensional structure of the synthetic lung Surfactant Protein B 
Peptide Super Mini-B was determined using an integrative experimental approach, 
including mass spectrometry and isotope enhanced Fourier-transform infrared 
(FTIR) spectroscopy. Mass spectral analysis of the peptide, oxidized by solvent 
assisted region-specific disulfide formation, confirmed that the correct folding 
and disulfide pairing could be facilitated using two different oxidative 
structure-promoting solvent systems. Residue specific analysis by isotope 
enhanced FTIR indicated that the N-terminal and C-terminal domains have well 
defined α-helical amino acid sequences. Using these experimentally derived 
measures of distance constraints and disulfide connectivity, the ensemble was 
further refined with molecular dynamics to provide a medium resolution, 
residue-specific structure for the peptide construct in a simulated synthetic 
lung surfactant lipid multilayer environment. The disulfide connectivity 
combined with the α-helical elements stabilize the peptide conformationally to 
form a helical hairpin structure that resembles critical elements of the Saposin 
protein fold of the predicted full-length Surfactant Protein B structure.

Long Term Oral Administration of Oregano Essence Effectively Relieves Polycystic 
Ovarian Rats through Endocrine and Inflammatory Balance.

Ghorbani Ranjbary A(1), Mehrzad J(1), Talebkhan Garoussi M(2), Zohdi J(1).

Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is alarmingly rising and sustainable 
therapy/prevention is needed. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of 
oregano or Origanum vulgare (O. vulgare) essence (OE) on the PCOS rat model 
system. Vaginal smears monitored the estrous cycle of 40 virgin adult rats, and 
they received 2 mg estradiol valerate (EV)/0.2 ml corn oil intramuscularly to 
induce PCOS. At 60 days post-EV injection, all rats were evaluated for 
follicular development/cysts. The EV-induced PCOS rats were orally administered 
250 and 500 mg/kgBW/day of OE for 30 days. OE was also further assessed for its 
predominant components along with hormonal, histological, and 
inflammatory-related gene expressions in the ovaries. The main components of the 
OE were predominantly pulegone (36.3), L-menthone (31.3%), far less piperitone 
(7.8%), isopiperitone (6.4%), isomenthol (3.6%), humulene epoxide II (2.2%), 
α-pinene (1.7%), and thymol (1.5%). Hormonal, histological, and 
inflammatory-related gene expression results showed >4-fold and 1.5-fold 
increase in FSH and progesterone; ∼50%, 85%, 45%, 55%, and 30% decreased in LH, 
estradiol, estrogen, testosterone, and AMH; and dose-dependently decreased in 
mRNA expression of IL-6, IL-1α, NF-kB, TNF-α, and IL-1β by 25-65%, 55-75%, 
15-40%, 30-55%, and 35-55%, respectively, and thus decreased the severity of 
PCOS, boosted endocrine balance, restored functional follicles and corpus 
luteum, and thus ovulation in PCOS rats. Overall, in the disrupted PCOS rats, OE 
oral treatment effectively relieved estradiol-induced PCOS rats via: (1) its 
endocrine balancing on GnRH, FSH, and LH and (2) its anti-inflammatory and 
antioxidant properties on ovary caused by OE's useful compounds like pulegone, 
thymol, and L-menthone. Though many aspects of the effects remain to be tested, 
such an underlying mechanistic reproductive regulatory effect observed in 
OE-administered rats further proves its sensible pharmaceutical applications in 
reproductive medicine and more specifically, PCOS.

α-L-rhamnosidase from Penicillium tardum and Its Application for 
Biotransformation of Citrus Rhamnosides.

Borzova N(1), Gudzenko O(2), Varbanets L(2).

Enzymatic deramnosylation of flavonoids is a convenient tool for improving the 
quality of citrus juices. α-L-rhamnosidase with a specific activity of 33.1 
units/mg was isolated and characterized from the culture liquid of Penicillium 
tardum. The molecular weight of the enzyme was 95 kDa according to the data of 
gel filtration on Sepharose 6B and gel electrophoresis in SDS-PAGE. The pH 
optimum of the enzyme activity was 5.0, and the thermo optimum was 60 °C. Enzyme 
showed high stability in the temperature range of 45-50 and at 60-70 °C. It 
retained 80 to 50% of the initial activity for 90 min. The half-life of 
α-L-rhamnosidase at 70 °C increased twofold in the presence of 20-40% glycerol 
and 2.3-fold in the presence of 4 M sorbitol. The enzyme was completely 
inhibited in the presence of 10-3 M Ag+ and Cd2+ and approximately by 90% in the 
presence of Fe2+, Fe3+, and Al3+ ions. More than 60%, the enzyme activity was 
inhibited by Hg2+, Co2+, and 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide 
methiodide. Activating effect of Ca2+ ions was also noted. Km and Vmax for the 
hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl-α-L-rhamnopyranoside and naringin were 0.7 mM and 
38.3 µM/min/mg and 1.34 mM and 43.7 µM/min/mg, respectively. Penicillium tardum 
α-L-rhamnosidase hydrolyzed naringin, neohesperidin, hesperidin, rutin, and 
narirutin at high rate, which allowed us to consider it as an effective tool for 
transformation of bioflavonoids in food industry.

Pinostrobin Suppresses the α-Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormone-Induced Melanogenic 
Signaling Pathway.

Athapaththu AMGK(1), Sanjaya SS(1), Lee KT(2), Karunarathne WAHM(1)(3), Choi 
YH(4), Hur SP(1), Kim GY(1).

Pinostrobin is a dietary flavonoid found in several plants that possesses 
pharmacological properties, such as anti-cancer, anti-virus, antioxidant, 
anti-ulcer, and anti-aromatase effects. However, it is unclear if pinostrobin 
exerts anti-melanogenic properties and, if so, what the underlying molecular 
mechanisms comprise. Therefore, we, in this study, investigated whether 
pinostrobin inhibits melanin biosynthesis in vitro and in vivo, as well as the 
potential associated mechanism. Pinostrobin reduced mushroom tyrosinase activity 
in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner, with an IC50 of 700 μM. Molecular 
docking simulations further revealed that pinostrobin forms a hydrogen bond, as 
well as other non-covalent interactions, between the C-type lectin-like fold and 
polyphenol oxidase chain, rather than the previously known copper-containing 
catalytic center. Additionally, pinostrobin significantly decreased 
α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH)-induced extracellular and intracellular 
melanin production, as well as tyrosinase activity, in B16F10 melanoma cells. 
More specifically, pinostrobin inhibited the α-MSH-induced melanin biosynthesis 
signaling pathway by suppressing the cAMP-CREB-MITF axis. In fact, pinostrobin 
also attenuated pigmentation in α-MSH-stimulated zebrafish larvae without 
causing cardiotoxicity. The findings suggest that pinostrobin effectively 
inhibits melanogenesis in vitro and in vivo via regulation of the cAMP-CREB-MITF 
axis.

Structural and biochemical analysis of the GDSL-family esterase CJ0610C from 
Campylobacter jejuni.

Ki DU(1), Song WS(2), Yoon SI(3).

GDSL domain-containing proteins generally hydrolyze esters or lipids and play 
critical roles in diverse biological and industrial processes. GDSL hydrolases 
use catalytic triad and oxyanion hole residues from conserved blocks I, II, III, 
and V to drive the esterase reaction. However, GDSL hydrolases exhibit large 
deviations in sequence, structure, and substrate specificity, requiring the 
characterization of each GDSL hydrolase to reveal its catalytic mechanism. We 
identified a GDSL protein (CJ0610C) from pathogenic Campylobacter jejuni and 
assessed its biochemical and structural features. CJ0610C displayed esterase 
activity for p-nitrophenyl acetate and preferred short chain esters and alkaline 
pH. The C-terminal two-thirds of CJ0610C corresponding to the GDSL domain forms 
a three-layered α/β/α fold as a core structure in which a five-stranded β-sheet 
is sandwiched by α-helices. In the CJ0610C structure, conserved catalytic triad 
and oxyanion hole residues that are indispensable for esterase activity are 
found in blocks I, III, and V. However, CJ0610C lacks the conserved block-II 
glycine residue and instead employs a unique asparagine residue as another 
oxyanion hole residue. Moreover, our structural analysis suggests that substrate 
binding is mediated by a CJ0610C-specific pocket, which is surrounded by 
hydrophobic residues and occluded at one end by a positively charged arginine 
residue.

Allosteric modulation of exosite 1 attenuates polyphosphate-catalyzed activation 
of factor XI by thrombin.

Yin R(1), Patel V(1), Malik RA(1), Fredenburgh JC(2), Weitz JI(3).

BACKGROUND: Polyphosphate (polyP) promotes feedback activation of factor (F) XI 
by thrombin by serving as a template. The contribution of thrombin's exosites to 
these interactions is unclear.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the contribution of thrombin exosites 1 and 2 to 
polyP-induced potentiation of FXI activation by thrombin.
METHODS: The affinities of α-thrombin; K109E/110E-thrombin, an exosite 1 
variant, or R93E-thrombin, an exosite 2 variant; FXI; and FXIa for polyP-70 were 
quantified using surface plasmon resonance in the absence or presence of exosite 
ligands. FXI was activated with α-thrombin or thrombin variants in the absence 
or presence of polyP-70 and exosite ligands.
RESULTS: α-Thrombin, K109/110E-thrombin, FXI, and FXIa bound polyP-70, whereas 
R93E-thrombin exhibited minimal binding. Exosite 1 and exosite 2 ligands 
attenuated thrombin binding to polyP-70. PolyP-70 accelerated the rate of FXI 
activation by α-thrombin and K109E/110E-thrombin but not R93E-thrombin up to 
1500-fold in a bell-shaped, concentration-responsive manner. Exosite 1 and 
exosite 2 ligands had no impact on FXI activation by thrombin in the absence of 
polyP-70; however, in its presence, they attenuated activation by 40% to 65%.
CONCLUSION: PolyP-70 binds FXI and thrombin and promotes their interaction. 
Exosite 2 ligands attenuate activation because thrombin binds polyP-70 via 
exosite 2. Attenuation of FXI activation by exosite 1 ligands likely reflects 
allosteric modulation of exosite 2 and/or the active site of thrombin because 
exosite 1 is not directly involved in FXI activation. Therefore, allosteric 
modulation of thrombin's exosites may represent a novel strategy for 
downregulating FXI activation.

An Analysis of COVID-19 Mortality During the Dominancy of Alpha, Delta, and 
Omicron in the USA.

Tabatabai M(1), Juarez PD(1), Matthews-Juarez P(1), Wilus DM(1), Ramesh A(1), 
Alcendor DJ(1), Tabatabai N(2), Singh KP(3).

BACKGROUND: The objective of the study was to measure the risk of death due to 
COVID-19 in relation to individuals' characteristics, and severity of their 
disease during the dominant periods of Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variants have 
influenced mortality rates.
METHODS: This study was conducted using COVID-19 Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) Case Surveillance Public Data Taskforce for 57 states, and 
United States territories between January 1, 2020 and March 20, 2022. 
Multivariable binary Hyperbolastic regression of type I was used to analyzes the 
data.
RESULTS: Seniors and ICU-admitted patients had the highest risk of death. For 
each additional percent increase in fully vaccinated individuals, the odds of 
death deceased by 1%. The odds of death prior to vaccine availability, compared 
to post vaccine availability, was 1.27. When comparing the time periods each 
variant was dominant, the odds of death was 3.45-fold higher during Delta 
compared to Alpha. All predictor variables had P-values ≤.001.
CONCLUSION: There was a noticeable difference in the odds of death among 
subcategories of age, race/ethnicity, sex, PMCs, hospitalization, ICU, vaccine 
availability, variant, and percent of fully vaccinated individuals.

Methods to study folding of alpha-helical membrane proteins in lipids.

Harris NJ(1), Pellowe GA(1), Blackholly LR(1), Gulaidi-Breen S(2), Findlay 
HE(1)(2), Booth PJ(1)(2).

How alpha-helical membrane proteins fold correctly in the highly hydrophobic 
membrane interior is not well understood. Their folding is known to be highly 
influenced by the lipids within the surrounding bilayer, but the majority of 
folding studies have focused on detergent-solubilized protein rather than 
protein in a lipid environment. There are different ways to study folding in 
lipid bilayers, and each method has its own advantages and disadvantages. This 
review will discuss folding methods which can be used to study alpha-helical

folding methods include in vitro folding methods in liposomes such as denaturant 
unfolding studies, and single-molecule force spectroscopy studies in bicelles, 
liposomes and native membranes. This review will also discuss recent advances in 
co-translational folding studies, which use cell-free expression with liposomes 
or nanodiscs or are performed in vivo with native membranes.

The PentUnFOLD algorithm as a tool to distinguish the dark and the light sides 
of the structural instability of proteins.

Poboinev VV(1), Khrustalev VV(2), Khrustaleva TA(3), Kasko TE(2), Popkov VD(2).

Intrinsically disordered proteins are frequently involved in important 
regulatory processes in the cell thanks to their ability to bind several 
different targets performing sometimes even opposite functions. The PentUnFOLD 
algorithm is a physicochemical method that is based on new propensity scales for 
disordered, nonstable and stable elements of secondary structure and on the 
counting of stabilizing and destabilizing intraprotein contacts. Unlike other 
methods, it works with a PDB file, and it can determine not only those fragments 
of alpha helices, beta strands, and random coils that can turn into disordered 
state (the "dark" side of the disorder), but also nonstable regions of alpha 
helices and beta strands which are able to turn into random coils (the "light" 
side), and vice versa (H ↔ C, E ↔ C). The scales have been obtained from 
structural data on disordered regions from the middle parts of amino acid 
sequences only, and not on their expectedly disordered N- and C-termini. Among 
other tendencies we have found that regions of both alpha helices and beta 
strands that can turn into the disordered state are relatively enriched in 
residues of Ala, Met, Asp, and Lys, while regions of both alpha helices and beta 
strands that can turn into random coil are relatively enriched in hydrophilic 
residues, and Cys, Pro, and Gly. Moreover, PentUnFOLD has the option to 
determine the effect of secondary structure transitions on the stability of a 
given region of a protein. The PentUnFOLD algorithm is freely available at

Deployment of metabolic heat rate based soft sensor for estimation and control 
of specific growth rate in glycoengineered Pichia pastoris for human interferon 
alpha 2b production.

Allampalli P(1), Rathinavelu S(1), Mohan N(2), Sivaprakasam S(3).

Lack of appropriate process models, reliable online sensors, and process 
variability in bioprocess systems are poising challenges in real-time monitoring 
and control of critical process parameters (CPPs). This present investigation 
deals with the development of a non-invasive soft sensor by utilizing metabolic 
heat rate as input signal for online estimation of specific growth rate (μest) 
during the induction phase of glycoengineered Pichia pastoris for human 
interferon-alpha 2b (huIFNα2b) production. Feedforward strategy employing a 
predetermined exponential feeding of methanol during the induction phase was 
dealt at defined setpoint values (μSP). Standard PID controller with 
predetermined gain values regulated methanol feeding in accordance with the 
deviation from the μSP value. An adaptive PID (gain scheduling) significantly 
minimized the deviation of μ from its μSP value, reduced the amplitude of 
oscillation and achieved long-term controller stability. Robust control of 
methanol feeding by adaptive PID resulted in a 1.5 and 2.2-fold increase in 
productivity of huIFNα2b compared to standard PID and feedforward controls 
respectively. Moreover, adaptive PID control facilitated narrow range control of 
μ for longer durations (> 20 h) with a low average tracking error (< 6%) 
enumerating its scope of application in therapeutic protein production in near 
future.

HelixGAN a deep-learning methodology for conditional de novo design of α-helix 
structures.

Xie X(1)(2), Valiente PA(2), Kim PM(1)(2)(3).

MOTIVATION: Protein and peptide engineering has become an essential field in 
biomedicine with therapeutics, diagnostics and synthetic biology applications. 
Helices are both abundant structural feature in proteins and comprise a major 
portion of bioactive peptides. Precise design of helices for binding or 
biological activity is still a challenging problem.
RESULTS: Here, we present HelixGAN, the first generative adversarial network 
method to generate de novo left-handed and right-handed alpha-helix structures 
from scratch at an atomic level. We developed a gradient-based search approach 
in latent space to optimize the generation of novel α-helical structures by 
matching the exact conformations of selected hotspot residues. The designed 
α-helical structures can bind specific targets or activate cellular receptors. 
There is a significant agreement between the helix structures generated with 
HelixGAN and PEP-FOLD, a well-known de novo approach for predicting peptide 
structures from amino acid sequences. HelixGAN outperformed RosettaDesign, and 
our previously developed structural similarity method to generate D-peptides 
matching a set of given hotspots in a known L-peptide. As proof of concept, we 
designed a novel D-GLP1_1 analog that matches the conformations of critical 
hotspots for the GLP1 function. MD simulations revealed a stable binding mode of 
the D-GLP1_1 analog coupled to the GLP1 receptor. This novel D-peptide analog is 
more stable than our previous D-GLP1 design along the MD simulations. We 
envision HelixGAN as a critical tool for designing novel bioactive peptides with 
specific properties in the early stages of drug discovery.

Crystal structure of a family VIII β-lactamase fold hydrolase reveals the 
molecular mechanism for its broad substrate scope.

Cea-Rama I(1), Coscolín C(2), Gonzalez-Alfonso JL(2), Raj J(3), Vasiljević M(3), 
Plou FJ(2), Ferrer M(2), Sanz-Aparicio J(1).

Family VIII esterases present similarities to class C β-lactamases, which show 
nucleophilic serines located at the S-X-X-K motif instead of the G-X-S-X-G or 
G-D-S-(L) motif shown by other carboxylesterase families. Here, we report the 
crystal structure of a novel family VIII (subfamily VIII. I) esterase (EH7 ; 
denaturing temperature, 52.6 ± 0.3 °C; pH optimum 7.0-9.0) to deepen its broad 
substrate range. Indeed, the analysis of the substrate specificity revealed its 
capacity to hydrolyse nitrocefin as a model chromogenic cephalosporin substrate 
(40.4 ± 11.4 units·g-1 ), and a large battery of 66 structurally different 
esters (up to 1730 min-1 ), including bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-terephthalate 
(241.7 ± 8.5 units·g-1 ) and the mycotoxin T-2 (1220 ± 52 units·g-1 ). It also 
showed acyltransferase activity through the synthesis of benzyl 3-oxobutanoate 
(40.4 ± 11.4 units·g-1 ) from benzyl alcohol and vinyl acetoacetate. Such a 
broad substrate scope is rare among family VIII esterases and lipolytic enzymes. 
Structural analyses of free and substrate-bound forms of this homooctamer 
esterase suggest that EH7 presents a more opened and exposed S1 site having no 
steric hindrance for the entrance of substrates to the active site, more 
flexible R1, R2 and R3 regions allowing for the binding of a wide spectrum of 
substrates into the active site, and small residues in the conserved motif Y-X-X 
containing the catalytic Tyr enabling the entrance of large substrates. These 
unique structural elements in combination with docking experiments allowed us to 
gain valuable insights into the substrate specificity of this esterase and 
possible others belonging to family VIII.

Embeddings from protein language models predict conservation and variant 
effects.

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants stressed the demand for tools allowing to 
interpret the effect of single amino acid variants (SAVs) on protein function. 
While Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS) sets continue to expand our understanding 
of the mutational landscape of single proteins, the results continue to 
challenge analyses. Protein Language Models (pLMs) use the latest deep learning 
(DL) algorithms to leverage growing databases of protein sequences. These 
methods learn to predict missing or masked amino acids from the context of 
entire sequence regions. Here, we used pLM representations (embeddings) to 
predict sequence conservation and SAV effects without multiple sequence 
alignments (MSAs). Embeddings alone predicted residue conservation almost as 
accurately from single sequences as ConSeq using MSAs (two-state Matthews 
Correlation Coefficient-MCC-for ProtT5 embeddings of 0.596 ± 0.006 vs. 
0.608 ± 0.006 for ConSeq). Inputting the conservation prediction along with 
BLOSUM62 substitution scores and pLM mask reconstruction probabilities into a 
simplistic logistic regression (LR) ensemble for Variant Effect Score Prediction 
without Alignments (VESPA) predicted SAV effect magnitude without any 
optimization on DMS data. Comparing predictions for a standard set of 39 DMS 
experiments to other methods (incl. ESM-1v, DeepSequence, and GEMME) revealed 
our approach as competitive with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods using MSA 
input. No method outperformed all others, neither consistently nor statistically 
significantly, independently of the performance measure applied (Spearman and 
Pearson correlation). Finally, we investigated binary effect predictions on DMS 
experiments for four human proteins. Overall, embedding-based methods have 
become competitive with methods relying on MSAs for SAV effect prediction at a 
fraction of the costs in computing/energy. Our method predicted SAV effects for 
the entire human proteome (~ 20 k proteins) within 40 min on one Nvidia Quadro 
RTX 8000. All methods and data sets are freely available for local and online 
execution through bioembeddings.com, https://github.com/Rostlab/VESPA , and

Evaluation of the effects of preconditioned human stem cells plus a scaffold and 
photobiomodulation administration on stereological parameters and gene 
expression levels in a critical size bone defect in rats.

Khosravipour A(1), Amini A(2), Farahani RM(1), Mostafavinia A(3), Asgari M(4), 
Rezaei F(5), Abrahamse H(6), Chien S(7), Bayat M(8)(9).

We assessed the impact of photobiomodulation (PBM) plus adipose-derived stem 
cells (ASCs) during the anabolic and catabolic stages of bone healing in a rat 
model of a critical size femoral defect (CSFD) that was filled with a 
decellularized bone matrix (DBM). Stereological analysis and gene expression 
levels of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), Runt-related transcription factor 
2 (RUNX2), and stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF1) were determined. There were 
six groups of rats. Group 1 was the untreated control or DBM. Study groups 2-6 
were treated as follows: ASC (ASC transplanted into DBM, then implanted in the 
CSFD); PBM (CSFD treated with PBM); irradiated ASC (iASC) (ASCs preconditioned 
with PBM, then transplanted into DBM, and implanted in the CSFD); ASC + PBM 
(ASCs transplanted into DBM, then implanted in the CSFD, followed by PBM 
administration); and iASC + PBM (the same as iASC, except CSFDs were exposed to 
PBM). At the anabolic step, all treatment groups had significantly increased 
trabecular bone volume (TBV) (24.22%) and osteoblasts (83.2%) compared to the 
control group (all, p = .000). However, TBV in group iASC + PBM groups were 
superior to the other groups (97.48% for osteoblast and 58.8% for trabecular 
bone volume) (all, p = .000). The numbers of osteocytes in ASC (78.2%) and 
iASC + PBM (30%) groups were remarkably higher compared to group control (both, 
p = .000). There were significantly higher SDF (1.5-fold), RUNX2 (1.3-fold), and 
BMP4 (1.9-fold) mRNA levels in the iASC + PBM group compared to the control and 
some of the treatment groups. At the catabolic step of bone healing, TBV 
increased significantly in PBM (30.77%), ASC + PBM (32.27%), and iASC + PBM 
(35.93%) groups compared to the control group (all, p = .000). There were 
significantly more osteoblasts and osteocytes in ASC (71.7%, 62.02%) (p = .002, 
p = .000); PBM (82.54%, 156%), iASC (179%, 23%), and ASC + PBM (108%, 110%) 
(all, p = .000), and iASC + PBM (79%, 100.6%) (p = .001, p = .000) groups 
compared to control group. ASC preconditioned with PBM in vitro plus PBM in vivo 
significantly increased stereological parameters and SDF1, RUNX2, and BMP4 mRNA 
expressions during bone healing in a CSFD model in rats.

Dual transgene amelioration of Lama2-null muscular dystrophy.

McKee KK(1), Yurchenco PD(2).

Null mutations of the Lama2-gene cause a severe congenital muscular dystrophy 
and associated neuropathy. In the absence of laminin-α2 (Lmα2) there is a 
compensatory replacement by Lmα4, a subunit that lacks the polymerization and 
α-dystroglycan (αDG)-binding properties of Lmα2. The dystrophic phenotype in the 
dy3K/dy3K Lama2-/- mouse were evaluated with transgenes driving expression of 
two synthetic laminin-binding linker proteins. Transgenic muscle-specific 
expression of αLNNd, a chimeric protein that enables α4-laminin polymerization, 
and miniagrin (mag), a protein that increases laminin binding to the receptor 
αDG, separately improved median mouse survival two-fold. The double transgenes 
(DT) improved mean survival three-fold with increases in overall body weight, 
muscle size, and grip strength, but, given absence of neuronal expression, did 
not prevent hindlimb paresis. Muscle improvements included increased myofiber 
size and number and reduced fibrosis. Myofiber hypertrophy with increased mTOR 
and Akt phosphorylation were characteristics of mag-dy3K/dy3K and DT-dy3K/dy3K 
muscle. Elevations of matrix-bound α4-, β1 and γ1 laminin subunits were detected 
in muscle extracts and immunostained sections in response to DT expression. 
Collectively, these findings reveal a complimentary polymerization and 
αDG-binding benefit to Lama2-/- mouse muscle largely mediated through modified 
laminin-411.

INTRODUCTION: Laryngeal manifestations of stroke have been sparsely described in 
the literature, specifically vocal fold paralysis (VFP). This study aimed to 
identify the prevalence, characteristics, and in-hospital outcomes of patients 
presenting with VFP after acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and intracerebral 
hemorrhage (ICH).
METHODS: A query of the 2000-2019 Nationwide Inpatient Sample was performed for 
patients admitted with AIS (ICD9 433, 43401, 43411, 43491, ICD-10 I63) and ICH 
(ICD9 431, 432.9, ICD-10 I61, I62.9). Demographics, comorbidities, and outcomes 
were identified. Univariate analysis with t-tests or chi-square performed as 
appropriate. A 1:1 nearest neighbor propensity score matched cohort was 
generated. Variables with standardized mean differences >0.1 used in 
multivariable regression to generate adjusted odds ratios (AOR)/β-coefficients 
for VFP on outcomes. Significance set at an alpha level of <0.001. All analysis 
performed in R version 4.1.3.
RESULTS: A total of 10,415,286 patients with AIS were included; 11,328 (0.1%) 
had VFP. Of 2,000,868 patients with ICH 2,132 (0.1%) had in-hospital VFP. 
Multivariable analysis revealed that patients with VFP after AIS were less 
likely to be discharged home (AOR 0.32; 95%CI: 0.18-0.57; p<0.001) and elevated 
total hospital charges (β coefficient=59,684.6; 
95%CI=18,365.12-101,004.07;p=0.005). Patients with VFP after ICH were less 
likely to experience in-hospital mortality (AOR 0.53; 95%CI: 0.34-0.79; p=0.002) 
with longer hospital stays (1.99 days; 95%CI: 1.78-2.21; p<0.001) and elevated 
total hospital charges (β coefficient=53,905.35; 
95%CI=16,352.84-91,457.85;p=0.005) CONCLUSION: Vocal fold paralysis in patients 
with ischemic stroke and ICH; although an infrequent complication, is associated 
with functional impairment, longer hospital stay, and higher charges.

Structural study of Legionella pneumophila effector DotY (Lpg0294), a component 
of the Dot/Icm type IV secretion system.

Chung IYW(1), Cygler M(1).

The bacterium Legionella pneumophila is a causative agent of Legionnaires' 
disease. It utilizes the Dot/Icm type IV secretion system (T4SS) to deliver over 
300 effector proteins into the host cell, leading to modification of cellular 
processes and creating a safe environment for bacterial proliferation. Dot/Icm 
is a multi-subunit molecular machine. The effectors are recognized by the inner 
membrane-embedded coupling complex (T4CC), which then delivers them to the 
translocation apparatus. This T4CC subcomplex is made up of DotL, DotM, DotN, 
IcmS, IcmW, LvgA, DotY and DotZ, and its structure was recently determined by 
cryo-EM. DotY is a highly mobile component of this subcomplex and its structure 
was only partially defined. DotY is a unique component of the T4SS that is only 
found in the Legionella genus. Here, the crystal structure of DotY on its own is 
presented and its fold and the connectivity of its secondary-structure elements 
are established. The protein is divided into three segments. The first and last 
segments form a four-helix bundle domain, while the middle segment forms an α/β 
domain that has a unique fold. The flexibility of the interdomain linkers allows 
the reorientation of the two domains between that observed in the crystal 
structure and that assumed within the T4CC subcomplex.

In Silico and In Vitro Approach to Assess Direct Allosteric AMPK Activators from 
Nature.

Kirchweger B(1)(2), Wasilewicz A(1)(2), Fischhuber K(1), Tahir A(1), Chen Y(1), 
Heiss EH(1), Langer T(1), Kirchmair J(1), Rollinger JM(1).

The 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an important 
metabolic regulator. Its allosteric drug and metabolite binding (ADaM) site was 
identified as an attractive target for direct AMPK activation and holds promise 
as a novel mechanism for the treatment of metabolic diseases. With the exception 
of lusianthridin and salicylic acid, no natural product (NP) is reported so far 
to directly target the ADaM site. For the streamlined assessment of direct AMPK 
activators from the pool of NPs, an integrated workflow using in silico and in 
vitro methods was applied. Virtual screening combining a 3D shape-based approach 
and docking identified 21 NPs and NP-like molecules that could potentially 
activate AMPK. The compounds were purchased and tested in an in vitro AMPK α 1 β 
1 γ 1 kinase assay. Two NP-like virtual hits were identified, which, at 30 µM 
concentration, caused a 1.65-fold (± 0.24) and a 1.58-fold (± 0.17) activation 
of AMPK, respectively. Intriguingly, using two different evaluation methods, we 
could not confirm the bioactivity of the supposed AMPK activator lusianthridin, 
which rebuts earlier reports.

Identifying B-cell epitopes using AlphaFold2 predicted structures and pretrained 
language model.

Zeng Y(1), Wei Z(1), Yuan Q(1), Chen S(1), Yu W(1), Lu Y(1), Gao J(2), Yang 
Y(1)(3).

MOTIVATION: Identifying the B-cell epitopes is an essential step for guiding 
rational vaccine development and immunotherapies. Since experimental approaches 
are expensive and time-consuming, many computational methods have been designed 
to assist B-cell epitope prediction. However, existing sequence-based methods 
have limited performance since they only use contextual features of the 
sequential neighbors while neglecting structural information.
RESULTS: Based on the recent breakthrough of AlphaFold2 in protein structure 
prediction, we propose GraphBepi, a novel graph-based model for accurate B-cell 
epitope prediction. For one protein, the predicted structure from AlphaFold2 is 
used to construct the protein graph, where the nodes/residues are encoded by 
ESM-2 learning representations. The graph is input into the edge-enhanced deep 
graph neural network (EGNN) to capture the spatial information in the predicted 
3D structures. In parallel, a bidirectional long short-term memory neural 
networks (BiLSTM) are employed to capture long-range dependencies in the 
sequence. The learned low-dimensional representations by EGNN and BiLSTM are 
then combined into a multilayer perceptron for predicting B-cell epitopes. 
Through comprehensive tests on the curated epitope dataset, GraphBepi was shown 
to outperform the state-of-the-art methods by more than 5.5% and 44.0% in terms 
of AUC and AUPR, respectively. A web server is freely available at 
http://bio-web1.nscc-gz.cn/app/graphbepi.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The datasets, pre-computed features, source 
codes, and the trained model are available at

Executive Function-Related Improvements on a Commercial CBT-Based Weight 
Management Intervention: Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.

Michaelides A(1), Mitchell ES(1), Behr H(1)(2), Ho AS(1), Hanada G(3), Lee J(4), 
McPartland S(5).

Executive functioning is a key component involved in many of the processes 
necessary for effective weight management behavior change (e.g., setting goals). 
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and third-wave CBT (e.g., mindfulness) are 
considered first-line treatments for obesity, but it is unknown to what extent 
they can improve or sustain executive functioning in a generalized weight 
management intervention. This pilot randomized controlled trial examined if a 
CBT-based generalized weight management intervention would affect executive 
functioning and executive function-related brain activity in individuals with 
obesity or overweight. Participants were randomized to an intervention condition 
(N = 24) that received the Noom Weight program or to a control group (N = 26) 
receiving weekly educational newsletters. EEG measurements were taken during 
Flanker, Stroop, and N-back tasks at baseline and months 1 through 4. After 4 
months, the intervention condition evidenced greater accuracy over time on the 
Flanker and Stroop tasks and, to a lesser extent, neural markers of executive 
function compared to the control group. The intervention condition also lost 
more weight than controls (-7.1 pounds vs. +1.0 pounds). Given mixed evidence on 
whether weight management interventions, particularly CBT-based weight 
management interventions, are associated with changes in markers of executive 
function, this pilot study contributes preliminary evidence that a 
multicomponent CBT-based weight management intervention (i.e., that which 
provides both support for weight management and is based on CBT) can help 
individuals sustain executive function over 4 months compared to controls.

Optogenetic closed-loop feedback control of the unfolded protein response 
optimizes protein production.

Benisch M(1), Benzinger D(2), Kumar S(1), Hu H(1), Khammash M(3).

In biotechnological protein production processes, the onset of protein unfolding 
at high gene expression levels leads to diminishing production yields and 
reduced efficiency. Here we show that in silico closed-loop optogenetic feedback 
control of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in S. cerevisiae clamps gene 
expression rates at intermediate near-optimal values, leading to significantly 
improved product titers. Specifically, in a fully-automated custom-built 
1L-photobioreactor, we used a cybergenetic control system to steer the level of 
UPR in yeast to a desired set-point by optogenetically modulating the expression 
of α-amylase, a hard-to-fold protein, based on real-time feedback measurements 
of the UPR, resulting in 60% higher product titers. This proof-of-concept study 
paves the way for advanced optimal biotechnology production strategies that 
diverge from and complement current strategies employing constitutive 
overexpression or genetically hardwired circuits.

Characterization of heterologously expressed Fibril, a shape and motility 
determining cytoskeletal protein of the helical bacterium Spiroplasma.

Harne S(1), Gayathri P(1).

Fibril is a constitutive filament-forming cytoskeletal protein of unidentified 
fold, exclusive to members of genus Spiroplasma. It is hypothesized to undergo 
conformational changes necessary to bring about Spiroplasma motility through 
changes in cell helicity. However, the mechanism driving conformational changes 
in Fibril remains unknown. We expressed Fibril from S. citri in E. coli for its 
purification and characterization. Sodium dodecyl sulfate solubilized Fibril 
filaments and facilitated purification by affinity chromatography. An 
alternative protocol for obtaining enriched insoluble Fibril filaments was 
standardized using density gradient centrifugation. Electron microscopy of 
Fibril purified by these protocols revealed filament bundles. Probable domain 
boundaries of Fibril protein were identified based on mass spectrometric 
analysis of proteolytic fragments. Presence of α-helical and β-sheet signatures 
in FT-IR measurements suggests that Fibril filaments consist of an assembly of 
folded globular domains, and not a β-strand-based aggregation like amyloid 
fibrils.

Cytokine gene variants of TNF-α and IL-10 in the propensity of type 2 diabetes 
in south Indian population.

Chronic inflammation plays an important role in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), 
a common endocrinological pro-inflammatory disorder associated with insulin 
resistance. The objective of the present study is to see individual and combined 
effect of TNF-α (rs361525, rs1800629) and IL-10 (rs1800872, rs1800896) genes on 
T2DM susceptibility The genotyping was carried out in 200 T2DM patients and 200 
healthy controls by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length 
polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) using suitable primers. The results shown that TNF-α (GA 
of rs361525 & rs1800629) and IL-10 (AA of rs1800872 & GA of rs1800896) genes are 
significantly linked with T2DM development. The presence of AA-GA genotype 
combination for both TNF-α and IL-10 genes were elevating the risk of T2DM. 
Moreover, individuals bearing haplotypes AAAA, AACA and AAAG experience the 
increased risk of T2DM. Furthermore, gene-gene interaction analysis shown that 
TNF-α (GA of rs361525 & rs1800896) gene redundantly confer 3.4-fold elevated 
risk for T2DM. In gene-environment interaction, GA of TNF-α -1800896, W/H ratio 
and TG/HDL ratio were redundantly interacted each other and increase the risk of 
T2DM by 67-times. In conclusion, our results reveal that there is a significant 
association between foresaid TNF-α, IL-10 gene promoter polymorphisms and T2DM 
development. To the best of our knowledge this study is the first of its kind in 
the literature reporting the epistatic association of TNF-α (rs1800629G/A) gene 
with TG/HDL ratio and W/H ratio over IL-10 gene polymorphisms for T2DM 
susceptibility among south Indians.

Unveiling the Catalytic Mechanism of GTP Hydrolysis in Microtubules.

Beckett D, Voth GA.

Microtubules (MTs) are large cytoskeletal polymers, composed of αβ-tubulin 
heterodimers, capable of stochastically converting from polymerizing to 
depolymerizing states and vice-versa. Depolymerization is coupled with 
hydrolysis of GTP within β-tubulin. Hydrolysis is favored in the MT lattice 
compared to free heterodimer with an experimentally observed rate increase of 
500 to 700 fold, corresponding to an energetic barrier lowering of 3.8 to 4.0 
kcal/mol. Mutagenesis studies have implicated α-tubulin residues, α:E254 and 
α:D251, as catalytic residues completing the β-tubulin active site of the lower 
heterodimer in the MT lattice. The mechanism for GTP hydrolysis in the free 
heterodimer, however, is not understood. Additionally, there has been debate 
concerning whether the GTP-state lattice is expanded or compacted relative to 
the GDP-state and whether a "compacted" GDP-state lattice is required for 
hydrolysis. In this work, extensive QM/MM simulations with transition-tempered 
metadynamics free energy sampling of compacted and expanded inter-dimer 
complexes, as well as free heterodimer, have been carried out to provide clear 
insight into the GTP hydrolysis mechanism. α:E254 was found to be the catalytic 
residue in a compacted lattice, while in the expanded lattice disruption of a 
key salt bridge interaction renders α:E254 less effective. The simulations 
reveal a barrier decrease of 3.8 ± 0.5 kcal/mol for the compacted lattice 
compared to free heterodimer, in good agreement with experimental kinetic 
measurements. Additionally, the expanded lattice barrier was found to be 6.3 ± 
0.5 kcal/mol higher than compacted, demonstrating that GTP hydrolysis is 
variable with lattice state and slower at the MT tip.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Microtubules (MTs) are large and dynamic components of 
the eukaryotic cytoskeleton with the ability to stochastically convert from a 
polymerizing to a depolymerizing state and vice-versa. Depolymerization is 
coupled to the hydrolysis of guanosine-5'-triphosphate (GTP), which is orders of 
magnitude faster in the MT lattice than in free tubulin heterodimers. Our 
results computationally ascertain the catalytic residue contacts in the MT 
lattice that accelerate GTP hydrolysis compared to the free heterodimer as well 
as confirm that a compacted MT lattice is necessary for hydrolysis while a more 
expanded lattice is unable to form the necessary contacts and thereby hydrolyze 
GTP.

Curcumin Has Beneficial Effects on Lysosomal Alpha-Galactosidase: Potential 
Implications for the Cure of Fabry Disease.

Monticelli M(1)(2)(3), Hay Mele B(1), Allocca M(2)(3), Liguori L(2)(3), Lukas 
J(4)(5), Monti MC(6), Morretta E(6), Cubellis MV(1)(2), Andreotti G(2).

Fabry disease is a lysosomal storage disease caused by mutations in the GLA gene 
that encodes alpha-galactosidase (AGAL). The disease causes abnormal 
globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) storage in the lysosomes. Variants responsible for 
the genotypic spectrum of Fabry disease include mutations that abolish enzymatic 
activity and those that cause protein instability. The latter can be 
successfully treated with small molecules that either bind and stabilize AGAL or 
indirectly improve its cellular activity. This paper describes the first attempt 
to reposition curcumin, a nutraceutical, to treat Fabry disease. We tested the 
efficacy of curcumin in a cell model and found an improvement in AGAL activity 
for 80% of the tested mutant genotypes (four out of five tested). The 
fold-increase was dependent on the mutant and ranged from 1.4 to 2.2. We 
produced evidence that supports a co-chaperone role for curcumin when 
administered with AGAL pharmacological chaperones (1-deoxygalactonojirimycin and 
galactose). The combined treatment with curcumin and either pharmacological 
chaperone was beneficial for four out of five tested mutants and showed 
fold-increases ranging from 1.1 to 2.3 for DGJ and from 1.1 to 2.8 for 
galactose. Finally, we tested a long-term treatment on one mutant (L300F) and 
detected an improvement in Gb3 clearance and lysosomal markers (LAMP-1 and GAA). 
Altogether, our findings confirmed the necessity of personalized therapies for 
Fabry patients and paved the way to further studies and trials of treatments for 
Fabry disease.

Short-term exposure to fumonisins and deoxynivalenol, on broiler growth 
performance and cecal Salmonella load during experimental Salmonella Enteritidis 
infection.

Liu JD(1), Shanmugasundaram R(2), Doupovec B(3), Schatzmayr D(3), Murugesan 
GR(4), Applegate TJ(5).

Fumonisins (FUM) and deoxynivalenol (DON) are two common mycotoxins in poultry 
feed. Salmonella enterica ser. Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis) is a primary 
foodborne bacterium in broilers. This trial was conducted to evaluate the 
effects of naturally occurring FUM and DON and their combination at subclinical 
doses on broiler performance during a S. Enteritidis challenge. The experiment 
consisted of five treatments: NCC, no-challenge no-mycotoxin treatment; CC, 
Salmonella challenge + no-mycotoxin treatment; DON, DON 0.6 mg/kg + Salmonella 
challenge; FUM, FUM 14 mg/kg + Salmonella challenge; DON + FUM + T-2 + 
neosolaniol, DON 0.6 mg/kg + FUM 14 mg/kg + T-2 toxin 0.6 mg/kg + 0.8 mg/kg 
neosolaniol + Salmonella challenge. On d 4, birds were challenged with either 0 
or 1 × 109 CFU/mL S. Enteritidis orally. There were no significant effects on 
growth performance among treatments at 0, 3, 7, and 14 d of post-inoculation 
(dpi). On 14 dpi, the combined DON + FUM + T-2 + neosolaniol significantly 
increased the Salmonella load by 1.5 logs compared to the control groups (P < 
0.05). FUM significantly increased the cecal tonsil IL-10 gene expression by 
1.2-fold at 7 dpi (P < 0.05) and downregulated TNF-α by 1.8-fold on 14 dpi 
compared to the control, nonchallenge groups (P < 0.05). On 7 dpi, the combined 
DON + FUM + T-2 + neosolaniol reduced occludin by 4.4-fold (P < 0.05) when 
compared to the control groups. Similarly, combined DON + FUM+ T-2 + neosolaniol 
decreased zona-occluden transcription by 2.3 and 7.6-fold on 3 and 14 dpi, 
respectively (P < 0.05). Furthermore, combined DON + FUM + T-2 + neosolaniol 
decreased Claudin-1 by 2.2-fold and Claudin-4 by 5.1-fold on 14 dpi when 
compared to the control groups (P < 0.05). In conclusion, short-term exposure to 
a subclinical dose of combined DON + FUM + T-2 + neosolaniol had an impact on 
broiler intestinal tight junction proteins and cecal Salmonella abundance under 
experimental Salmonella challenge.

Association between preoperative frontal electroencephalogram alpha asymmetry 
and postoperative quality of recovery: an observational study.

Bae J(1), Lee JS(2), Oh J(3), Han DW(1), Jung H(1), Kim SM(2), Song Y(4).

BACKGROUND: Left-sided frontal alpha asymmetry on electroencephalograms, which 
indicates decreased relative left-hemispheric activity, has been associated with 
depression, anxiety, and stress responsivity. We aimed to evaluate the 
association between perioperative measures of frontal alpha asymmetry and 
quality of recovery (QoR) after surgery.
METHODS: We enrolled 110 female patients undergoing thyroidectomy and recorded 
perioperative electroencephalograms. The power of the prefrontal alpha band 
(8-13 Hz) was measured in the Fp1 and Fp2 leads. Left-sided frontal alpha 
asymmetry was defined as a higher alpha band power in Fp1 than in Fp2 and vice 
versa. QoR was assessed using the QoR-15 score on the day before surgery and 
postoperative days 1 and 2. The primary study endpoint was a difference in 
postoperative global QoR-15 score between preoperative left-sided and 
right-sided alpha asymmetry groups. The predictability of frontal alpha 
asymmetry for poor QoR-15 score was also evaluated.
RESULTS: The global QoR-15 score showed a significant group-by-time interaction, 
and post-hoc analysis revealed significantly lower scores on postoperative days 
1 (P=0.006) and 2 (P<0.001) in the left-sided frontal alpha asymmetry group. In 
the multivariate logistic regression analysis, preoperative left-sided frontal 
alpha asymmetry was associated with a 3.3-fold increased risk of the lowest 
tertile for the postoperative day 1 QoR-15 score (95% CI: 1.31-8.24; P=0.011).
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative left-sided frontal alpha asymmetry was independently 
associated with a lower postoperative QoR-15 score in female patients undergoing 
thyroidectomy, highlighting the potential role of preoperative frontal 
electroencephalography in predicting patient-centred outcomes after surgery.

A novel multi-target strategy for Alzheimer's disease treatment via sublingual 
route: Donepezil/memantine/curcumin-loaded nanofibers.

Bocekci VG(5), Duruksu G(3), Sahin Cam C(6), Yazir Y(3), Gunduz O(7), Cam ME(8).

Drug delivery systems that not only show efficacy through multiple therapeutic 
pathways but also facilitate patient drug use and exhibit a high bioavailability 
profile represent a promising strategy in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). Here, donepezil (DO)/memantine (MM)/curcumin (CUR)-loaded electrospun 
nanofibers (NFs) were produced for the treatment of AD. DSC, XRD, and FT-IR 
studies demonstrated the complete incorporation of the drug into PVA/PVP NFs. 
The disintegration profile was improved by loading the drugs in PVA/PVP with 
fast wetting (less than 1 s), the start of disintegration (21 s), and dispersion 
in 110 s. The desired properties for sublingual application were achieved with 
the dissolution of NFs in 240 s. The cell viability in DO/MM/CUR-loaded NFs was 
similar to the control group after 48 h in the cell culture. DO/MM/CUR-loaded 
NFs enhanced the expressions of BDNF (13.5-fold), TUBB3 (8.9-fold), Neurog2 
(5.6-fold), NeuroD1 (5.8-fold), Nestin (166-fold), and GFAP (115-fold). 
DO/MM/CUR-loaded NFs and powder of these drugs contained in these fibers were 
daily administered sublingually to intracerebroventricular-streptozotocin 
(icv-STZ) treated rats. DO/MM/CUR-loaded NFs treatment improved the short-term 
memory damage and enhanced memory, learning ability, and spatial exploration 
talent. Results indicated that the levels of Aβ, Tau protein, APP, GSK-3β, AChE, 
and TNF-α were significantly decreased, and BDNF was increased by 
DO/MM/CUR-loaded NFs treatment compared to the AD group. In the 
histopathological analysis of the hippocampus and cortex, neuritic plaques and 
neurofibrillary nodes were not observed in the rats treated with 
DO/MM/CUR-loaded NFs. Taken together, the sublingual route delivery of 
DO/MM/CUR-loaded NFs supports potential clinical applications for AD.

Cigarette smoke exposed airway epithelial cell-derived EVs promote 
pro-inflammatory macrophage activation in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.

Khodayari N(1), Oshins R(2), Mehrad B(2), Lascano JE(2), Qiang X(3), West JR(2), 
Holliday LS(4), Lee J(2), Wiesemann G(5), Eydgahi S(2), Brantly M(2).

BACKGROUND: Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic disorder most 
commonly secondary to a single mutation in the SERPINA1 gene (PI*Z) that causes 
misfolding and accumulation of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) in hepatocytes and 
mononuclear phagocytes which reduces plasma AAT and creates a toxic gain of 
function. This toxic gain of function promotes a pro-inflammatory phenotype in 
macrophages that contributes to lung inflammation and early-onset COPD, 
especially in individuals who smoke cigarettes. The aim of this study is to 
determine the role of cigarette exposed AATD macrophages and bronchial 
epithelial cells in AATD-mediated lung inflammation.
METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from AATD and healthy individuals 
were differentiated into alveolar-like macrophages and exposed to air or 
cigarette smoke while in culture. Macrophage endoplasmic reticulum stress was 
quantified and secreted cytokines were measured using qPCR and cytokine ELISAs. 
To determine whether there is "cross talk" between epithelial cells and 
macrophages, macrophages were exposed to extracellular vesicles released by 
airway epithelial cells exposed to cigarette smoke and their inflammatory 
response was determined.
RESULTS: AATD macrophages spontaneously produce several-fold more 
pro-inflammatory cytokines as compared to normal macrophages. AATD macrophages 
have an enhanced inflammatory response when exposed to cigarette smoke-induced 
extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from airway epithelial cells. Cigarette 
smoke-induced EVs induce expression of GM-CSF and IL-8 in AATD macrophages but 
have no effect on normal macrophages. Release of AAT polymers, potent neutrophil 
chemo attractants, were also increased from AATD macrophages after exposure to 
cigarette smoke-induced EVs.
CONCLUSIONS: The expression of mutated AAT confers an inflammatory phenotype in 
AATD macrophages which disposes them to an exaggerated inflammatory response to 
cigarette smoke-induced EVs, and thus could contribute to progressive lung 
inflammation and damage in AATD individuals.

Maternal elevated inflammation impairs placental fatty acids β-oxidation in 
women with gestational diabetes mellitus.

Visiedo F(1), Vázquez-Fonseca L(1), Ábalos-Martínez J(1), Broullón-Molanes 
JR(1)(2)(3), Quintero-Prado R(4), Mateos RM(5), Bugatto F(1)(2)(3).

INTRODUCTION: An adverse proinflammatory milieu contributes to abnormal cellular 
energy metabolism response. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is closely 
related to an altered maternal inflammatory status. However, its role on lipid 
metabolism regulation in human placenta has not yet been assessed. The aim of 
this study was to examine the impact of maternal circulating inflammatory 
mediators ([TNF]-α, [IL]-6, and Leptin) on placental fatty acid metabolism in 
GDM pregnancies.
METHODS: Fasting maternal blood and placental tissues were collected at term 
deliveries from 37 pregnant women (17 control and 20 GDM). Molecular approach 
techniques as radiolabeled lipid tracers, ELISAs, immunohistochemistry and 
multianalyte immunoassay quantitative analysis, were used to quantify serum 
inflammatory factors' levels, to measure lipid metabolic parameters in placental 
villous samples (mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation [FAO] rate and lipid content 
[Triglycerides]), and to analyze their possible relationships. The effect of 
potential candidate cytokines on fatty acid metabolism in ex vivo placental 
explants culture following C-section a term was also examined.
RESULTS: Maternal serum IL-6, TNF-α and leptin levels were significantly 
increased in GDM patients compared with control pregnant women (9,9±4,5 vs. 
3,00±1,7; 4,5±2,8 vs. 2,1±1,3; and 10026,7±5628,8 vs. 5360,2±2499,9 pg/ml, 
respectively). Placental FAO capacity was significantly diminished (~30%; 
p<0.01), whereas triglyceride levels were three-fold higher (p<0.01) in 
full-term GDM placentas. Uniquely the maternal IL-6 levels showed an inverse and 
positive correlation with the ability to oxidize fatty acids and triglyceride 
amount in placenta, respectively (r= -0,602, p=0.005; r= 0,707, p=0.001). 
Additionally, an inverse correlation between placental FAO and triglycerides was 
also found (r=-0.683; p=0.001). Interestingly, we ex vivo demonstrated by using 
placental explant cultures that a prolonged exposure with IL-6 (10 ng/mL) 
resulted in a decline in the fatty acid oxidation rate (~25%; p=0.001), along to 
acute increase (2-fold times) in triglycerides accumulation (p=0.001), and in 
lipid neutral and lipid droplets deposits.
CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced maternal proinflammatory cytokines levels (essentially 
IL-6) is closely associated with an altered placental fatty acid metabolism in 
pregnancies with GDM, which may interfere with adequate delivery of maternal fat 
across the placenta to the fetus.

Alpha Cell Thioredoxin-interacting Protein Deletion Improves Diabetes-associated 
Hyperglycemia and Hyperglucagonemia.

Lu B(1), Chen J(1), Xu G(1), Grayson TB(1), Jing G(1), Jo S(1), Shalev A(1).

Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) has emerged as a key factor in 
pancreatic beta cell biology, and its upregulation by glucose and diabetes 
contributes to the impairment in functional beta cell mass and glucose 
homeostasis. In addition, beta cell deletion of TXNIP protects against diabetes 
in different mouse models. However, while TXNIP is ubiquitously expressed, its 
role in pancreatic alpha cells has remained elusive. We generated an alpha cell 
TXNIP knockout (aTKO) mouse and assessed the effects on glucose homeostasis. 
While no significant changes were observed on regular chow, after a 30-week 
high-fat diet, aTKO animals showed improvement in glucose tolerance and lower 
blood glucose levels compared to their control littermates. Moreover, in the 
context of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes, aTKO mice showed significantly 
lower blood glucose levels compared to controls. While serum insulin levels were 
reduced in both control and aTKO mice, STZ-induced diabetes significantly 
increased glucagon levels in control mice, but this effect was blunted in aTKO 
mice. Moreover, glucagon secretion from aTKO islets was >2-fold lower than from 
control islets, while insulin secretion was unchanged in aTKO islets. At the 
same time, no change in alpha cell or beta cell numbers or mass was observed, 
and glucagon and insulin expression and content were comparable in isolated 
islets from aTKO and control mice. Thus together the current studies suggest 
that downregulation of alpha cell TXNIP is associated with reduced glucagon 
secretion and that this may contribute to the glucose-lowering effects observed 
in diabetic aTKO mice.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common movement disorder, with resting 
tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia and postural instability being major symptoms1. 
Neuropathologically, it is characterized by the presence of abundant filamentous 
inclusions of α-synuclein in the form of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites in some 
brain cells, including dopaminergic nerve cells of the substantia nigra2. PD is 
increasingly recognised as a multisystem disorder, with cognitive decline being 
one of its most common non-motor symptoms. Many patients with PD develop 
dementia more than 10 years after diagnosis3. PD dementia (PDD) is clinically 
and neuropathologically similar to dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), which is 
diagnosed when cognitive impairment precedes parkinsonian motor signs or begins 
within one year from their onset4. In PDD, cognitive impairment develops in the 
setting of well-established PD. Besides PD and DLB, multiple system atrophy 
(MSA) is the third major synucleinopathy5. It is characterized by the presence 
of abundant filamentous α-synuclein inclusions in brain cells, especially 
oligodendrocytes (Papp-Lantos bodies). We previously reported the electron 
cryo-microscopy structures of two types of α-synuclein filament extracted from 
the brains of individuals with MSA6. Each filament type is made of two different 
protofilaments. Here we report that the cryo-electron microscopy structures of 
α-synuclein filaments from the brains of individuals with PD, PDD and DLB are 
made of a single protofilament (Lewy fold) that is markedly different from the 
protofilaments of MSA. These findings establish the existence of distinct 
molecular conformers of assembled α-synuclein in neurodegenerative disease.

Neuroprotective Effects of Erinacine A on an Experimental Model of Traumatic 
Optic Neuropathy.

Hsu CL(1)(2), Wen YT(2), Hsu TC(3), Chen CC(4), Lee LY(4), Chen WP(4), Tsai 
RK(1)(2)(5).

Erinacine A (EA), a natural neuroprotectant, is isolated from a Chinese herbal 
medicine, Hericium erinaceus. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
neuroprotective effects of EA in a rat model of traumatic optic neuropathy. The 
optic nerves (ONs) of adult male Wistar rats were crushed using a standardized 
method and divided into three experimental groups: phosphate-buffered saline 
(PBS control)-treated group, standard EA dose-treated group (2.64 mg/kg in 0.5 
mL of PBS), and double EA dose-treated group (5.28 mg/kg in 0.5 mL of PBS). 
After ON crush, each group was fed orally every day for 14 days before being 
euthanized. The visual function, retinal ganglion cell (RGC) density, and RGC 
apoptosis were determined using flash visual-evoked potentials (fVEP) analysis, 
retrograde Fluoro-Gold labelling, and TdT-dUTP nick end-labelling (TUNEL) assay, 
respectively. Macrophage infiltration of ON was detected by immunostaining 
(immunohistochemistry) for ED1. The protein levels of 
phosphor-receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase1 (pRIP1), caspase 
8 (Cas8), cleaved caspase 3 (cCas3), tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, tumour 
necrosis factor receptor1 (TNFR1), interleukin (IL)-1β, inducible nitric oxide 
synthase (iNOS), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), haem 
oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) were evaluated by Western 
blotting. When comparing the standard EA dose-treated group and the double EA 
dose-treated group with the PBS-treated group, fVEP analysis showed that the 
amplitudes of P1−N2 in the standard EA dose group and the double EA dose-treated 
group were 1.8 and 2.4-fold, respectively, higher than that in the PBS-treated 
group (p < 0.05). The density of RGC in the standard EA dose-treated group and 
the double EA dose-treated group were 2.3 and 3.7-fold, respectively, higher 
than that in the PBS-treated group (p < 0.05). The TUNEL assay showed that the 
standard EA dose-treated group and the double EA dose-treated group had 
significantly reduced numbers of apoptotic RGC by 10.0 and 15.6-fold, 
respectively, compared with the PBS-treated group (p < 0.05). The numbers of 
macrophages on ON were reduced by 1.8 and 2.2-fold in the standard EA 
dose-treated group and the double EA dose-treated group, respectively (p < 
0.01). On the retinal samples, the levels of pRIP, Cas8, cCas3, TNF-α, TNFR1, 
IL-1β, and iNOS were decreased, whereas those of Nrf2, HO-1, and SOD1 were 
increased in both EA-treated groups compared to those in the PBS-treated group 
(p < 0.05). EA treatment has neuroprotective effects on an experimental model of 
traumatic optic neuropathy by suppressing apoptosis, neuroinflammation, and 
oxidative stress to protect the RGCs from death as well as preserving the visual 
function.

Cellular and Humoral Immunity against Different SARS-CoV-2 Variants Is 
Detectable but Reduced in Vaccinated Kidney Transplant Patients.

Thümmler L(1)(2), Gäckler A(3), Bormann M(1), Ciesek S(4)(5)(6), Widera M(4), 
Rohn H(1), Fisenkci N(2), Otte M(1), Alt M(1), Dittmer U(7), Horn PA(2), Witzke 
O(1), Krawczyk A(1)(7), Lindemann M(2).

In kidney transplant (KTX) patients, immune responses after booster vaccination 
against SARS-CoV-2 are inadequately examined. We analyzed these patients a 
median of four months after a third/fourth vaccination and compared them to 
healthy controls. Cellular responses were analyzed by interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) 
and interleukin-2 (IL-2) ELISpot assays. Neutralizing antibody titers were 
assessed against SARS-CoV-2 D614G (wild type) and the variants alpha, delta, and 
omicron by a cell culture-based neutralization assay. Humoral immunity was also 
determined by a competitive fluorescence assay, using 11 different variants of 
SARS-CoV-2. Antibody ratios were measured by ELISA. KTX patients showed 
significantly lower SARS-CoV-2-specific IFN-γ responses after booster 
vaccination than healthy controls. However, SARS-CoV-2-specific IL-2 responses 
were comparable to the T cell responses of healthy controls. Cell culture-based 
neutralizing antibody titers were 1.3-fold higher in healthy controls for D614G, 
alpha, and delta, and 7.8-fold higher for omicron (p < 0.01). Healthy controls 
had approximately 2-fold higher concentrations of potential neutralizing 
antibodies against all 11 variants than KTX patients. However, more than 60% of 
the KTX patients displayed antibodies to variants of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, KTX 
patients should be partly protected, due to neutralizing antibodies to variants 
of SARS-CoV-2 or by cross-reactive T cells, especially those producing IL-2.

A Single Amino Acid Replacement Boosts the Analgesic Activity of α-Conotoxin 
AuIB through the Inhibition of the GABA(B)R-Coupled N-Type Calcium Channel.

Y(1), Liao M(2), Dai Q(1).

α-conotoxin AuIB is the only one of the 4/6 type α-conotoxins (α-CTxs) that 
inhibits the γ-aminobutyric acid receptor B (GABABR)-coupled N-type calcium 
channel (CaV2.2). To improve its inhibitory activity, a series of variants were 
synthesized and evaluated according to the structure-activity relationships of 
4/7 type α-CTxs targeting GABABR-coupled CaV2.2. Surprisingly, only the 
substitution of Pro7 with Arg results in a 2-3-fold increase in the inhibition 
of GABABR-coupled CaV2.2 (IC50 is 0.74 nM); substitutions of position 9-12 with 
basic or hydrophobic amino acid and the addition of hydrophobic amino acid Leu 
or Ile at the second loop to mimic 4/7 type α-CTxs all failed to improve the 
inhibitory activity of AuIB against GABABR-coupled CaV2.2. Interestingly, the 
most potent form of AuIB[P7R] has disulfide bridges of "1-4, 2-3" (ribbon), 
which differs from the "1-3, 2-4" (globular) in the isoforms of wildtype AuIB. 
In addition, AuIB[P7R](globular) displays potent analgesic activity in the 
acetic acid writhing model and the partial sciatic nerve injury (PNL) model. Our 
study demonstrated that 4/6 type α-CTxs, with the disulfide bridge connectivity 
"1-4, 2-3," are also potent inhibitors for GABABR-coupled CaV2.2, exhibiting 
potent analgesic activity.

Combination of puerarin and tanshinone IIA alleviates ischaemic stroke injury in 
rats via activating the Nrf2/ARE signalling pathway.

Miao Q(1), Wang R(1), Sun X(1), Du S(1), Liu L(1).

CONTEXT: Puerarin (Pue) and tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA) are often used in 
combination in the treatment of cerebrovascular diseases.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the neuroprotective effect and synergic mechanism of 
Pue-Tan IIA on the treatment of ischaemic stroke (IS).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: IS was induced in rats by middle cerebral artery 
occlusion (MCAO). Rats were intraperitoneally injected with Pue (36 mg/kg), Tan 
IIA (7.2 mg/kg), or Pue-Tan IIA (36 and 7.2 mg/kg) for five times [30 min before 
ischaemia, immediately after reperfusion (0 h), 24, 48, and 72 h after 
reperfusion]. After administration, neurological function assessment and 
histological changes in the brain were performed. S-100β and NSE levels were 
measured to determine the severity of brain injury. Oxidative stress parameters 
and inflammatory mediators were measured. The proteins involved in Nrf2/ARE 
signalling pathway were determined by qRT-PCR and western blot.
RESULTS: After administration, the neurological function scores, infarct volume, 
S-100β, and NSE levels were significantly reduced in MCAO rats, especially with 
Pue-Tan IIA treatment (p < 0.05). All treatments increased T-AOC, CAT, SOD, and 
GSH activities and reduced GSSG activity and MDA, TNF-α, IL-6, ICAM-1, and COX-2 
levels in MCAO rats. Pue-Tan IIA significantly increased Nrf2 expression in the 
nucleus (1.81-fold) and decreased its expression in the cytoplasm (0.60-fold). 
Pue-Tan IIA significantly increased the expressions of HO-1 (1.87-fold) and NQO1 
(1.76-fold) and decreased Keap1 expression (0.39-fold).
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The combination of Pue and Tan IIA could alleviate 
ischaemic brain injury by activating Nrf2/ARE signalling pathway, providing an 
experimental basis for clinical applications.

Combination of IL-17A/F and TNF-α uniquely alters the bronchial epithelial cell 
proteome to enhance proteins that augment neutrophil migration.

Altieri A(1)(2), Piyadasa H(1)(2)(3), Hemshekhar M(1), Osawa N(1), Recksiedler 
B(1), Spicer V(1), Hiemstra PS(4), Halayko AJ(5)(6), Mookherjee N(7)(8)(9).

BACKGROUND: The heterodimer interleukin (IL)-17A/F is elevated in the lungs in 
chronic respiratory disease such as severe asthma, along with the 
pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Although IL-17A/F and 
TNF-α are known to functionally cooperate to exacerbate airway inflammation, 
proteins altered by their interaction in the lungs are not fully elucidated.
RESULTS: We used Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamer-based proteomic array to 
identify proteins that are uniquely and/or synergistically enhanced by 
concurrent stimulation with IL-17A/F and TNF-α in human bronchial epithelial 
cells (HBEC). The abundance of 38 proteins was significantly enhanced by the 
combination of IL-17A/F and TNF-α, compared to either cytokine alone. Four out 
of seven proteins that were increased > 2-fold were those that promote 
neutrophil migration; host defence peptides (HDP; Lipocalin-2 (LCN-2) and 
Elafin) and chemokines (IL-8, GROα). We independently confirmed the synergistic 
increase of these four proteins by western blots and ELISA. We also functionally 
confirmed that factors secreted by HBEC stimulated with the combination of 
IL-17A/F and TNF-α uniquely enhances neutrophil migration. We further showed 
that PI3K and PKC pathways selectively control IL-17A/F + TNF-α-mediated 
synergistic production of HDPs LCN-2 and Elafin, but not chemokines IL-8 and 
GROα. Using a murine model of airway inflammation, we demonstrated enhancement 
of IL-17A/F, TNF-α, LCN-2 and neutrophil chemokine KC in the lungs, thus 
corroborating our findings in-vivo.
CONCLUSION: This study identifies proteins and signaling mediated by concurrent 
IL-17A/F and TNF-α exposure in the lungs, relevant to respiratory diseases 
characterized by chronic inflammation, especially neutrophilic airway 
inflammation such as severe asthma.

Eyestalk neuropeptide identification in the female red deep-sea crab, Chaceon 
quinquedens.

Green S(1), Bachvaroff T(1), Sook Chung J(2).

Eyestalk-derived neuropeptides, primarily the crustacean hyperglycemic hormone 
(CHH) neuropeptide family, regulate vitellogenesis in decapod crustaceans. The 
red deep-sea crab, Chaceon quinquedens, a cold-water species inhabiting depths 
between 200 and 1800 m, has supported a small fishery, mainly harvesting adult 
males in the eastern US for over 40 years. This study aimed to understand the 
role of eyestalk-neuropeptides in vitellogenesis in C. quinquedens with an 
extended intermolt stage. Chromatography shows two CHH and one MIH peak in the 
sinus gland, with a CHH2 peak area four times larger than CHH1. The cDNA 
sequence of MIH and CHH of C. quinquedens is isolated from the eyestalk ganglia, 
and the qPCR assay shows MIH is significantly higher only at ovarian stages 3 
than 4 and 5. However, MIH transcript and its neuropeptides do differ between 
stages 1 and 3. While CHH transcripts remain constant, its neuropeptide levels 
are higher at stages 3 than 1. Additionally, transcriptomic analysis of the de 
novo eyestalk ganglia assembly at ovarian stages 1 and 3 found 28 eyestalk 
neuropeptides. A GIH/VIH or GSH/VSH belonging to the CHH family is absent in the 
transcriptome. Transcripts per million (TPM) values of ten neuropeptides 
increase by 1.3 to 2.0-fold at stage 3 compared to stage 1: twofold for Bursicon 
α, followed by CHH, AKH/corazonin-like, Pyrokinin, CCAP, Glycoprotein B, PDH1, 
and IDLSRF-like peptide, and 1.3-fold of allatostatin A and short NP-F. 
WXXXRamide, the only downregulated neuropeptide, decreases TPM by ∼ 2-fold at 
stage 3, compared to stage 1. Interestingly, neuroparsin with the highest TPM 
values remains the same in stages 1 and 3. The mandibular organ-inhibiting 
hormone is not found in de novo assembly. We report that CHH, MIH, and eight 
other neuropeptides may play a role in vitellogenesis in this species.

Protecting human amnion and chorion matrices (HACM) during processing: 
Performance enhancement in a Diabetic Mouse Model and Human Co-culture System.

Sanders MC(1), Balaji S(2), Martin WB(3), Siegmund N(1), Poland L(1), Sanders 
Hanna M(1), Wei D(1), Kaliada H(3), Littlejohn S(3), Ganey T(3).

Recent evidence suggests that protecting human amnion and chorion matrices 
(HACM)1 during processing enhances the performance of HACM for wound repair and 
tissue regeneration. We utilized a diabetic (db/db) delayed wound healing mouse 
model. Treatment of db/db full thickness excisional wounds with HACM, processed 
with a polyampholyte preservative accentuated the proliferative phase of wound 
healing that decreased the time necessary to heal wounds. Polyampholyte 
protection improved the preservation of growth factors and cytokines during room 
temperature storage following E-beam sterilization and improved its function in 
wound healing applications. Our findings indicate protected HACM tissue 
upregulated MIP2, NF-kB, TNF-alpha, KI-67, and Arg1 (0.6- to 1.5-fold) but those 
changes were not statistically significant. Immunofluorescent assessment 
identifying cell activity illustrated an induction of the proliferative phase of 
wound healing and a switch from an inflammatory macrophage phenotype (M1) to a 
pro-regenerative macrophage phenotype (M2a). Genomic profiling of 282 genes was 
performed using Nanostring from co-cultures of human macrophages and 
fibroblasts. The polyampholyte + HACM treated group, compared to the HACM or 
polyampholyte alone groups, had a statistically significant up regulation 
(32-368 fold) of 12 genes primarily involved in macrophage plasticity including 
CLC7, CD209, CD36, HSD11B1, ICAM1, IL1RN, IL3RA, ITGAX, LSP1, and PLXDC2 (adj. p 
val <0.05). The polyampholyte alone group demonstrated statistically significant 
down regulation of four genes ADRA2, COL7A1, CSF3, and PTGS2 (adj p < 0.05). The 
HACM alone group upregulated four genes ATG14, CXCL11, DNMT3A and THBD, but the 
results were not statistically significant. Biomechanical measurements indicated 
that wounds treated with polyampholyte protected HACM had more tensile integrity 
compared to wounds treated with HACM alone. These findings indicate that better 
protection of HACM during processing stabilizes the HACM matrix which may lead 
to improved wound healing outcomes. This article is protected by copyright. All

In-silico and in-vitro hybrid approach to identify glucagon-like peptide-1 
receptor agonists from anti-diabetic natural products.

Chatterjee D(1), Vhora N(2), Goswami A(1), Hiray A(1), Jain A(2)(3), Kate AS(1).

Natural products have contributed immensely towards the treatment of various 
diseases including diabetes. Here, a database of small molecules from nature 
possessing antidiabetic properties was analysed and shortlisted according to 
their structural diversity. Later, those structures were screened by in-silico 
docking studies to understand their affinity towards glucagon-like peptide-1 
(GLP-1) receptor. The selected molecules were isolated and investigated further 
by integrated in-vitro and in-silico approaches. Alpha-mangostin was found to be 
suitable due to its excellent docking score and isolation yield. A pancreatic 
beta cell line was used to test the activity of alpha-mangostin and observed a 
3-fold increase in insulin secretion compared to 15 mM glucose control. Further, 
in-silico molecular dynamics simulations studies have validated its target by 
showing conformational changes at the functionally active part of the GLP-1 
receptor. This screening strategy can be applied to identify pertinent natural 
products rapidly for various therapeutic targets.

A Single Nasal Dose Vaccination with a Brucella abortus Mutant Potently Protects 
against Pulmonary Infection.

Wang H(1), Clapp B(1), Hoffman C(1), Yang X(1), Pascual DW(1).

The Brucella abortus double-mutant (ΔznuA ΔnorD Brucella abortus-lacZ [znBAZ]) 
was assessed for its protective efficacy after vaccination with a single nasal 
dose. Superior protection was achieved in znBAZ-vaccinated mice against 
pulmonary, wild-type B. abortus 2308 challenge when compared with conventional 
livestock Brucella abortus vaccines, the smooth S19 (smooth B. abortus strain 19 
vaccine) and rough RB51 (rough mutant vaccine strain of B. abortus) strains. 
Nasal znBAZ vaccination reduced splenic and lung colonization by wild-type 
brucellae by >3-4 logs. In contrast, S19 reduced lung colonization by only 
32-fold, and RB51 failed to reduce colonization. One profound attribute of znBAZ 
vaccination was the >3-fold increase in pulmonary CD8+ T cells when compared 
with other vaccinated groups. S19 vaccination increased only CD4+ T cells. All 
vaccines induced IFN-γ and TNF-α production by CD4+ T cells, but only znBAZ 
vaccination enhanced the recruitment of polyfunctional CD8+ T cells, by 
>100-fold. IL-17 by both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was also induced by subsequent 
znBAZ vaccination. These results demonstrate that, in addition to achieving 
protective immunity by CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, specifically resident memory 
T cells, also confer protection against brucellosis. The protection obtained by 
znBAZ vaccination was attributed to IFN-γ-producing CD8+ T cells, because 
depletion of CD8+ T cells throughout vaccination and challenge phases abrogated 
protection. The stimulation of only CD4+ T cells by RB51- and S19-vaccinated 
mice proved insufficient in protecting against pulmonary B. abortus 2308 
challenge. Thus, nasal znBAZ vaccination offers an alternative means to elicit 
protection against brucellosis.

Protein salvage and repurposing in evolution: phospholipase D toxins are 
stabilized by a remodeled scrap of a membrane association domain.

Cordes MHJ(1), Sundman AK(1), Fox HC(1), Binford GJ(2).

The GDPD-like SMaseD/PLD domain family, which includes phospholipase D (PLD) 
toxins in recluse spiders and actinobacteria, evolved anciently in bacteria from 
the glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterases (GDPD). The PLD enzymes retained 
the core (β/α)8 barrel fold of GDPD, while gaining a signature C-terminal 
expansion motif and losing a small insertion domain. Using sequence alignments 
and phylogenetic analysis, we infer that the C-terminal motif derives from a 
segment of an ancient bacterial PLAT domain. Formally, part of a protein 
containing a PLAT domain repeat underwent fusion to the C terminus of a GDPD 
barrel, leading to attachment of a segment of a PLAT domain, followed by a 
second complete PLAT domain. The complete domain was retained only in some basal 
homologs, but the PLAT segment was conserved and repurposed as the expansion 
motif. The PLAT segment corresponds to strands β7-β8 of a β-sandwich, while the 
expansion motif as represented in spider PLD toxins has been remodeled as an 
α-helix, a β-strand, and an ordered loop. The GDPD-PLAT fusion led to two 
acquisitions in founding the GDPD-like SMaseD/PLD family: 1) a PLAT domain that 
presumably supported early lipase activity by mediating membrane association, 
and 2) an expansion motif that putatively stabilized the catalytic domain, 
possibly compensating for, or permitting, loss of the insertion domain. Of wider 
significance, messy domain shuffling events can leave behind scraps of domains 
that can be salvaged, remodeled and repurposed. This article is protected by

Chlorogenic acid attenuates pro-inflammatory response in the blood of 
streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.

Lee Y(#)(1), Bae CS(#)(1), Ahn T(2).

BACKGROUND: Chlorogenic acid (CGA) has been shown to reduce pro-inflammation by 
scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species. In this 
study, the anti-inflammatory effect of CGA was expanded to streptozotocin 
(STZ)-induced diabetic rats. The inter-relationships among oxidative stress, 
pro-inflammation, and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A enzymes were also investigated in 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of STZ-diabetic rats.
RESULTS: The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-6 and tumor 
necrosis factor-alpha, increased by approximately 3.4- and 2.9-fold, 
respectively, and the albumin concentration decreased in the serum of 
STZ-induced diabetic rats compared to normal rats. The C-reactive protein (CRP) 
values also increased by about 3.8-fold higher, indicating that STZ induced an 
inflammation in the blood of STZ-diabetic rats. The expression levels and 
catalytic activities of CYP1A enzymes were elevated by approximately 2.2-2.5- 
and 4.3-6.7-fold, respectively, in the PBMC of STZ-treated rats. A decrease in 
the amount of PBMC-bound albumin was also observed. In contrast, the levels of 
cytokines and CRP in serum and the activities of CYP1A enzymes in PBMC were 
significantly reduced in CGA-treated diabetic rats in a CGA 
concentration-dependent manner. In addition, STZ-mediated elevation of ROS in 
serum and PBMC was decreased by the CGA administration. However, the CGA 
treatment did not change the enhanced blood glucose level and expression of 
CYP1A enzymes by STZ. STZ-mediated decrease in the levels of serum and 
PBMC-bound albumin was not also restored by the CGA administration.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that CGA could be used to treat type 1 
diabetes-induced inflammation.

Mediation of Sinusoidal Network Oscillations in the Locus Coeruleus of Newborn 
Rat Slices by Pharmacologically Distinct AMPA and KA Receptors.

Rawal B(1), Ballanyi K(1).

Brain control by locus coeruleus (LC) neurons involves afferent glutamate (Glu) 
inputs. In newborns, LC Glu receptors and responses may be sparse due to 
immaturity of the brain circuits providing such input. However, we reported, 
using newborn rat brain slices, that Glu and its ionotropic receptor (iGluR) 
agonist NMDA transform spontaneous local field potential (LFP) rhythm. Here, we 
studied whether α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic-acid (AMPA) and 
kainate (KA) iGluR subtypes also transform the LFP pattern. AMPA (0.25-0.5 µM) 
and KA (0.5-2.5 µM) merged ~0.2 s-lasting bell-shaped LFP events occurring at ~1 
Hz into ~40% shorter and ~4-fold faster spindle-shaped and more regular 
sinusoidal oscillations. The AMPA/KA effects were associated with a 3.1/4.3-fold 
accelerated phase-locked single neuron spiking due to 4.0/4.2 mV depolarization 
while spike jitter decreased to 64/42% of the control, respectively. Raising 
extracellular K+ from 3 to 9 mM increased the LFP rate 1.4-fold or elicited 
slower multipeak events. A blockade of Cl--mediated inhibition with gabazine (5 
μM) plus strychnine (10 μM) affected neither the control rhythm nor AMPA/KA 
oscillations. GYKI-53655 (25 μM) blocked AMPA (but not KA) oscillations whereas 
UBP-302 (25 μM) blocked KA (but not AMPA) oscillations. Our findings revealed 
that AMPA and KA evoke a similar novel neural network discharge pattern 
transformation type by acting on pharmacologically distinct AMPAR and KA 
receptors. This shows that already the neonatal LC can generate oscillatory 
network behaviors that may be important, for example, for responses to opioids.

Robust antiviral responses in severe hepatitis flare persist after early 
retreatment cessation and lead toward hepatitis B surface antigen loss: A 
proof-of-concept study.

Chang ML(1), Chien RN(1), Liaw YF(1).

AIM: Hepatitis B flare has been interpreted as result of immune response against 
upsurging hepatitis B virus (HBV) and its antigen(s) that may lead to HBV 
decline/clearance spontaneously. It has been speculated that antiviral therapy 
could halt the effective immune response with viral persistent as a consequence. 
A proof-of-concept study was conducted to investigate this issue.
METHODS: Serial biochemical, quantitative hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), 
interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and tumor-necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) assays were performed 
in four patients with severe hepatitis flare who had achieved precipitous HBsAg 
decline within 4 weeks of antiviral therapy.
RESULTS: TNF-α and IFN-γ were found to be elevated in parallel to upsurging HBV 
DNA and HBsAg levels in all patients. Higher levels of TNF-α and IFN-γ and 
levels relative to qHBsAg were observed during and after early termination of 
therapy within 4 weeks in two patients and were followed by further HBsAg 
decline to <5 IU/ml and even achieved HBsAg loss in one patient. The patient who 
had stopped therapy on day 44 showed minimal HBsAg decline afterward and the 
patient who continued therapy showed a 10-fold rebound of qHBsAg from its nadir. 
The subsequent IFN-γ and TNF-α activity of these two patients was minimal.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that patients with severe hepatitis flare who 
achieved precipitous HBsAg decline may have robust immune response to clear the 
virus, and early termination of antiviral therapy may allow the protective 
immune response to continue and accelerate HBV decline toward HBsAg loss.

Resonance assignments of the microtubule-binding domain of the 
microtubule-associated protein 7 (MAP7).

Adler A(1), Kjaer LF(1)(2), Beugelink JW(3), Baldus M(4), van Ingen H(5).

The microtubule-associated protein 7 (MAP7) is a protein involved in cargo 
transport along microtubules (MTs) by interacting with kinesin-1 through the 
C-terminal kinesin-binding domain. Moreover, the protein is reported to 
stabilize MT, thereby playing a key role in axonal branch development. An 
important element for this latter function is the 112 amino-acid long N-terminal 
microtubule-binding domain (MTBD) of MAP7. Here we report NMR backbone and 
side-chain assignments that suggest a primarily alpha-helical secondary fold of 
this MTBD in solution. The MTBD contains a central long α-helical segment that 
includes a short four-residue 'hinge' sequence with decreased helicity and 
increased flexibility. Our data represent a first step towards analysing the 
complex interaction of MAP7 with MTs at an atomic level via NMR spectroscopy.

A proteomics approach to decipher a sticky CHO situation.

Kumar S(1), Kumar A(2), Huhn S(2), DeVine L(3), Cole R(3), Du Z(2), Betenbaugh 
M(1).

Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells serve as protein therapeutics workhorses, so 
it is useful to understand what intrinsic properties make certain host cell 
lines and clones preferable for scale up and production of target proteins. In 
this study, two CHO host cell lines (H1, H2), and their respective clones were 
evaluated using comparative TMT-proteomics. The clones obtained from host H1 
showed increased productivity (6.8 times higher) in comparison to clones from 
host H2. Based on fold-change analyses, we observed differential regulation in 
pathways including cell adhesion, aggregation, and cellular metabolism among 
others. In particular, the cellular adhesion pathway was downregulated in H1, in 
which podoplanin, an antiadhesion molecule, was upregulated the most in host H1 
and associated clones. Phenotypically, these cells were less likely to aggregate 
and adhere to surfaces. In addition, enzymes involved in cellular metabolism 
such as isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and mitochondrial-d-lactate dehydrogenase 
( d-LDHm) were also found to be differentially regulated. IDH plays a key role 
in TCA cycle and isocitrate-alpha-ketoglutarate cycle while d-LDHm aids in the 
elimination of toxic metabolite methylglyoxal, involved in protein degradation. 
These findings will enhance our efforts towards understanding why certain CHO 
cell lines exhibit enhanced performance and perhaps provide future cell 
engineering targets.

Directed Evolution of Soluble α-1,2-Fucosyltransferase Using Kanamycin 
Resistance Protein as a Phenotypic Reporter for Efficient Production of 
2'-Fucosyllactose.

Shin J(1)(2), Kim S(1), Park W(1), Jin KC(3), Kim SK(3), Kweon DH(1).

2'-Fucosyllactose (2'-FL), the most abundant fucosylated oligosaccharide in 
human milk, has multiple beneficial effects on human health. However, its 
biosynthesis by metabolically engineered Escherichia coli is often hampered 
owing to the insolubility and instability of α-1,2-fucosyltransferase (the 
rate-limiting enzyme). In this study, we aimed to enhance 2'-FL production by 
increasing the expression of soluble α-1,2-fucosyltransferase from Helicobacter 
pylori (FucT2). Because structural information regarding FucT2 has not been 
unveiled, we decided to improve the expression of soluble FucT2 in E. coli via 
directed evolution using a protein solubility biosensor that links protein 
solubility to antimicrobial resistance. For such a system to be viable, the 
activity of kanamycin resistance protein (KanR) should be dependent on FucT2 
solubility. KanR was fused to the C-terminus of mutant libraries of FucT2, which 
were generated using a combination of error-prone PCR and DNA shuffling. 
Notably, one round of the directed evolution process, which consisted of mutant 
library generation and selection based on kanamycin resistance, resulted in a 
significant increase in the expression level of soluble FucT2. As a result, a 
batch fermentation with the ΔL M15 pBCGW strain, expressing the FucT2 mutant 
(F#1-5) isolated from the first round of the directed evolution process, 
resulted in the production of 0.31 g/l 2'-FL with a yield of 0.22 g 2'-FL/g 
lactose, showing 1.72- and 1.51-fold increase in the titer and yield, 
respectively, compared to those of the control strain. The simple and powerful 
method developed in this study could be applied to enhance the solubility of 
other unstable enzymes.

Parkinson's disease (PD) and Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) are progressive and 
unremitting neurological diseases that are neuropathologically characterized by 
α-synuclein inclusions. Increasing evidence supports the aggregation of 
α-synuclein in specific brain areas early in the disease course, followed by the 
spreading of α-synuclein pathology to multiple brain regions. However, little is 
known about how the structure of α-synuclein fibrils influence its ability to 
seed endogenous α-synuclein in recipient cells. Here, we aggregated α-synuclein 
by seeding with homogenates of PD- and MSA-confirmed brain tissue, determined 
the resulting α-synuclein fibril structures by cryo-electron microscopy, and 
characterized their seeding potential in mouse primary oligodendroglial 
cultures. The combined analysis shows that the two patient material-amplified 
α-synuclein fibrils share a similar protofilament fold but differ in their 
inter-protofilament interface and their ability to recruit endogenous 
α-synuclein. Our study indicates that the quaternary structure of α-synuclein 
fibrils modulates the seeding of α-synuclein pathology inside recipient cells. 
It thus provides an important advance in the quest to understand the connection 
between the structure of α-synuclein fibrils, cellular seeding/spreading, and 
ultimately the clinical manifestations of different synucleinopathies.

Yang Y(1)(2), Han Z(1), Tian T(1), Liao Q(1), Geng J(1), Xiao Y(1).

OBJECTIVE: To study the chemical constituents from the aerial parts of Scoparia 
dulcis.
METHODS: Various chromatographic techniques were used to separate the 
constituents and their structures were elucidated using spectroscopic methods 
and by comparing their data to those reported in the literatures. The 
α-glucosidase inhibitory activity assay was used to identify potential 
α-glucosidase inhibitors.
RESULTS: Nine compounds were isolated from the aerial parts of S. dulcis. Their 
structures were identified as Scoparic zolone (1), 
(2S)-2,7-dihydroxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one (2), 
(2R)-7-hydroxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one-2-O-β-d-glucopyranoside (3), 
(2R)-7-methoxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one-2-O-β-d-glucopyranoside (4), 
(2S)-7-hydroxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one-2-O-β-d-glucopyranoside (5), 
6-methoxy-benzoxazolin-2(3H)-one (6), 4-acetonyl-3,5-dimethoxy-p-quinol (7), 
zizyvoside I (8), and 3,4-dihydroxy benzeneacetic acid (9). Compound 2 showed 
the potent α-glucosidase inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 
(132.8 ± 11.5) μmol/L, which is 28-fold higher than the positive control 
acarbose.
CONCLUSION: Compound 1 is a new natural product. Compounds 2 and 9 have not been 
reported in Scoparia before. Compounds 3, 5, 7, 8 are isolated from 
Scrophulariaceae for the first time.

Wound alpha defensin levels are significantly higher in patients with fracture 
related infection: A pilot, prospective cohort study.

Kumar P(1), Mittal A(2), Bansal P(1), Aggarwal S(1), Rajnish RK(3), Dadra A(1), 
Sharma S(4).

BACKGROUND: In absence of frank purulence, wound cultures represent 
'gold-standard' for diagnosis of fracture related infection (FRI). However, 
these are time-intensive, and may be falsely negative, necessitating the need 
for accurate and rapid biomarker-based diagnosis. We conducted this study to 
determine the accuracy of 3 wound-based biomarkers for the diagnosis of FRI.
METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study on adult patients who underwent an 
operative procedure for an upper or lower limb fracture. Wound fluid levels of 
alpha-defensin (AD), neutrophil elastase (NE) and IL-6 were evaluated on 
post-operative day 2, and patients were followed up for one month. Patients were 
categorized as cases (FRI) or controls (no FRI), on the basis of the consensus 
definition of FRI. Univariate analysis, along with receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed.
RESULTS: 48 patients were included. AD levels showed a 2.6-fold elevation in 
cases (n = 26, Median = 23.74 µg/ml) as compared to controls (n = 22, 
Median = 8.78 µg/ml). The area under the curve for this variable was 0.71 (95% 
Confidence Intervals = 0.56 - 0.86). The levels of NE and IL-6 were not 
significantly different between cases and controls.
CONCLUSION: Wound AD levels are significantly elevated in patients with FRI. 
However, these results need to be validated in a larger cohort of patients 
before it can be used as a biomarker of FRI.

Potential role of EBV and Toll-like receptor 9 ligand in patients with systemic 
lupus erythematosus.

SLE is a multisystem autoimmune disease characterized by multiple immunological 
abnormalities including production of autoantibodies. While the etiology of SLE 
is largely unknown, it is generally accepted that both genetic and environmental 
factors contribute to disease risk and immune dysregulation. Production of IFN-α 
is important for protecting the host against infections; however, over 
stimulation of innate immune pathways can induce autoimmune disease. 
Environmental factors, particularly Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), have been proposed 
to play an important role in SLE disease. Improper engagement of Toll-like 
receptor (TLR) pathways by endogenous or exogenous ligands may lead to the 
initiation of autoimmune responses and tissue injury. EBV is shown to be a 
potent stimulant of IFN-α by TLR signaling cascades. Given the highlighted role 
of IFN-α in SLE pathogenesis and potential role of EBV infection in this 
disease, the present study is aimed at exploring the in vitro effects of EBV 
infection and CPG (either alone or in combination) on IFN-α. We also examined 
the expression level of CD20 and BDCA-4 and CD123 in PBMCs in 32 SLE patients 
and 32 healthy controls. Our results showed PBMCs treated with CPG-induced 
higher levels of IFN-α and TLR-9 gene expression fold change compared to cells 
treated with either EBV or EBV-CPG. Moreover, PBMCs treated with CPG produced 
significantly higher IFN-α concentration in supernatant compared to cells 
treated with EBV but not EBV-CPG. Our results further highlight the potential 
role of EBV infection and TLRs in SLE patients although more studies are 
warranted to ascertain the global imprint that EBV infection can have on immune 
signature in patients with SLE.

Biological Control Efficacy and Action Mechanism of Klebsiella pneumoniae 
JCK-2201 Producing Meso-2,3-Butanediol Against Tomato Bacterial Wilt.

Kim B(1), Park AR(1), Song CW(2), Song H(2), Kim JC(1).

Bacterial wilt caused by Ralstonia solanacearum is a fatal disease that affects 
the production of tomatoes and many other crops worldwide. As an effective 
strategy to manage bacterial wilt, biological control agents using plant 
growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are being developed. In this study, we 
screened 2,3-butanediol (BDO)-producing PGPR to control tomato bacterial wilt 
and investigated the action mechanism of the disease control agent. Of the 943 
strains isolated from soil, Klebsiella pneumoniae strain JCK-2201 produced the 
highest concentration of 2,3-BDO. The culture broth of K. pneumoniae JCK-2201 
did not show any direct activity on R. solanacearum in vitro, but a 100-fold 
dilution effectively controlled tomato bacterial wilt with a control value of 
77% in vivo. Fermentation utilizing K. pneumoniae JCK-2201 was optimized to 
produce 48 g/L of meso-2,3-BDO, which is 50% of the sucrose conversion 
efficiency. In addition, the control efficacy and mechanism of meso-2,3-BDO 
produced by JCK-2201 in tomato bacterial wilt were determined by comparative 
analysis with Bacillus licheniformis DSM13 producing meso-2,3-BDO and B. 
licheniformis DSM13 ΔalsS that did not produce 2,3-BDO, as the step of 
converting pyruvate to α-acetolactate was omitted. Tomato seedlings treated with 
the K. pneumoniae JCK-2201 (500-fold dilution) and B. licheniformis DSM13 
(100-fold dilution) culture broth produced meso-2,3-BDO that significantly 
reduced R. solanacearum-induced disease severity with control values of 55% and 
63%, respectively. The formulated meso-2,3-BDO 9% soluble concentrate (SL; 
1,000-fold dilution) showed 87% control against tomato bacterial wilt in the 
field condition. Klebsiella pneumoniae JCK-2201 and B. licheniformis DSM13 
treatment induced the expression of plant defense marker genes, such as LePR1, 
LePR2, LePR5, LePR3, and PI-II, in the salicylic acid and jasmonic acid 
signaling pathways at 4 days after inoculation. These results show that 
2,3-BDO-producing bacteria and 2,3-BDO are potential biological control agents 
that act through induction of resistance for controlling tomato bacterial wilt.

Widespread alterations upon exposure to the estrogenic endocrine disruptor 
ethinyl estradiol in the liver proteome of the marine male fish Cyprinodon 
variegatus.

Schönemann AM(1), Beiras R(2), Diz AP(3).

Quantitative proteomic changes in the liver of adult males of Sheepshead minnow 
(Cyprinodon variegatus) upon exposure to ethinyl estradiol (EE2) were assessed 
to provide an advanced understanding of the metabolic pathways affected by 
estrogenic endocrine disruption in marine fish, and to identify potential novel 
molecular biomarkers for the environmental exposure to estrogens. From a total 
of 3188 identified protein groups (hereafter proteins), 463 showed a 
statistically significant difference in their abundance between EE2 treatment 
and solvent control samples. The most affected biological processes upon EE2 
exposure were related to ribosomal biogenesis, protein synthesis and transport 
of nascent proteins to endoplasmic reticulum, and nuclear mRNA catabolism. 
Within the group of upregulated proteins, a subset of 14 proteins, involved in 
egg production (Vitellogenin, Zona Pellucida), peptidase activity (Cathepsine E, 
peptidase S1, Serine/threonine-protein kinase PRP4 homolog, Isoaspartyl 
peptidase and Whey acidic protein), and nucleic acid binding (Poly [ADP-ribose] 
polymerase 14) were significantly upregulated with fold-change values higher 
than 3. In contrast, Collagen alpha-2, involved in the process of response to 
steroid hormones, among others, was significantly downregulated (fold 
change = 0.2). This pattern of alterations in the liver proteome of adult males 
of C. variegatus can be used to identify promising novel biomarkers for the 
characterization of exposure of marine fish to estrogens. The Whey acidic 
protein-like showed the highest upregulation in EE2-exposed individuals (21-fold 
over controls), suggesting the utility of abundance levels of this protein in 
male liver as a novel biomarker of xenoestrogen exposure.

Experimental Elucidation of Templated Crystallization and Secondary Processing 
of Peptides.

Verma V(1), Bade I(1), Karde V(1), Heng JYY(1)(2).

The crystallization of peptides offers a sustainable and inexpensive alternative 
to the purification process. In this study, diglycine was crystallised in porous 
silica, showing the porous templates' positive yet discriminating effect. The 
diglycine induction time was reduced by five-fold and three-fold upon 
crystallising in the presence of silica with pore sizes of 6 nm and 10 nm, 
respectively. The diglycine induction time had a direct relationship with the 
silica pore size. The stable form (α-form) of diglycine was crystallised in the 
presence of porous silica, with the diglycine crystals obtained associated with 
the silica particles. Further, we studied the mechanical properties of diglycine 
tablets for their tabletability, compactability, and compressibility. The 
mechanical properties of the diglycine tablets were similar to those of pure 
MCC, even with the presence of diglycine crystals in the tablets. The diffusion 
studies of the tablets using the dialysis membrane presented an extended release 
of diglycine through the dialysis membrane, confirming that the peptide crystal 
can be used for oral formulation. Hence, the crystallization of peptides 
preserved their mechanical and pharmacological properties. More data on 
different peptides can help us produce oral formulation peptides faster than 
usual.

URTICA DIOICA EXTRACT DOWNREGULATES THE GENE EXPRESSION OF 5Α-RII IN HACAT 
CELLS: POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS AGAINST ANDROGENIC SKIN DISEASES.

Pekmezci E(1), Türkoğlu M(2).

Urtica dioica (Ud) is a perennial plant of temperate climate regions and has 
been reported therapeutic activity against benign prostate hyperplasia, mainly 
due to its 5-alpha-reductase (5α-R) inhibition feature, which has been singly 
shown only in prostatic tissues until now. Also considering its use in 
traditional medicine against some dermatological problems and hair loss, we 
performed an in-vitro study to reveal its 5α-R inhibition activity in skin cells 
whether this plant may have a therapeutic potential against androgenic skin 
diseases. After the preparation of Ud leaf extract and determination of 
non-cytotoxic concentration, cultured HaCaT cells were treated with the plant 
extract. RNA isolations were carried out from both non-treated and treated cell 
groups. cDNA synthesis was performed using gene specific primers of 
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as reference gene and 5α-R type 
II (5α-RII) as study material. Gene expressions were determined by real time 
reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. Results 
were represented as 'Target/GAPDH Fold Change'. Results of gene expression 
analysis showed that plant extract caused statistically significant 
downregulation of 5α-RII gene expression (p=0.0021) in treated cells, compared 
to untreated control cells, and ended up with 0.5873±0.0586 fold change. This 
study is the first one showing the suppression of 5α-RII gene expression on skin 
cells with unmixed or solitary Ud extract. With the currently reported 
anti-androgenic activity in HaCaT cells, it can be suggested that Ud has a solid 
scientific base and may have a promising future in cosmetic dermatology, and new 
product development against androgenic skin diseases.

Enhancing the secretion of a feruloyl esterase in Bacillus subtilis by signal 
peptide screening and rational design.

Liu P(1), Guo J(1), Miao L(2), Liu H(1).

Feruloyl esterase is a subclass of α/β hydrolase, which could release ferulic 
acid from biomass residues for use as an efficient additive in food or 
pharmaceutical industries. In the present study, a feruloyl esterase with broad 
substrate specificity was characterised and secreted by Bacillus subtilis WB600. 
After codon usage optimisation and signal peptide library screening, the 
secretion amount of feruloyl esterase was enhanced by up to 10.2-fold in 
comparison with the base strain. The site-specific amino acid substitutions that 
facilitate protein folding further improved the secretion by about 1.5-fold. The 
purified rationally designed enzyme exhibited maximal activity against methyl 
ferulate at pH 6.5 and 65 °C. In the solid-state fermentation, the genetically 
engineered B. subtilis released about 37% of the total alkali-extractable 
ferulic acid in maize bran. This study provides a promising candidate for 
ferulic acid production and demonstrates that the secretion of a heterologous 
enzyme from B. subtilis can be cumulatively improved by changes in protein 
sequence features.

Screening and identification of genes involved in β-alanine biosynthesis in 
Bacillus subtilis.

Yang S(1), Li J(1), Meng R(1), Yu T(2), Wang Z(1), Xiong P(3), Gao Z(4).

β-alanine is the only naturally occurring β-amino acid, which is widely used in 
medicine, food, and feed fields, and generally produced through synthetic 
biological methods based on engineered strains of Escherichia coli or 
Corynebacterium glutamicum. However, the β-alanine biosynthesis in Bacillus 
subtilis, a traditional industrial model microorganism of food safety grade, has 
not been thoroughly explored. In this study, the native 
l-aspartate-α-decarboxylase was overexpressed in B. subtilis 168 to obtain an 
increase of 842% in β-alanine production. A total of 16 single-gene knockout 
strains were constructed to block the competitive consumption pathways to 
identify a total of 6 genes (i.e., ptsG, fbp, ydaP, yhfS, mmgA, and pckA) 
involved in β-alanine synthesis, while the multigene knockout of these 6 genes 
obtained an increased β-alanine production by 40.1%. Ten single-gene suppression 
strains with the competitive metabolic pathways inhibited revealed that the 
inhibited expressions of genes glmS, accB, and accA enhanced the β-alanine 
production. The introduction of heterologous phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase 
increased the β-alanine production by 81.7%, which was 17-fold higher than that 
of the original strain. This was the first study using multiple molecular 
strategies to investigate the biosynthetic pathway of β-alanine in B. subtilis 
and to identify the genetic factors limiting the excessive synthesis of 
β-alanine by microorganisms.

Proteomic and metabonomic analysis uncovering Enterovirus A71 reprogramming host 
cell metabolic pathway.

Shi H(1), Liu S(2), Tan Z(1), Yin L(1), Zeng L(1), Liu T(1), Zhang S(1), Zhang 
L(1).

Enterovirus A71 (EV71) infection can cause hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) 
and severe neurological complications in children. However, the biological 
processes regulated by EV71 remain poorly understood. Herein, proteomics and 
metabonomics studies were conducted to uncover the mechanism of EV71 infection 
in rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells and identify potential drug targets. Differential 
expressed proteins from enriched membrane were analyzed by isobaric tags for 
relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based proteomics technology. 
Twenty-six differential proteins with 1.5-fold (p < 0.05) change were detected, 
including 14 upregulated proteins and 12 downregulated proteins. The upregulated 
proteins are mainly involved in metabolic process, especially in the glycolysis 
pathway. Alpha-enolase (ENO1) protein was found to increase with temporal 
dependence following EV71 infection. The targeted metabolomics analysis revealed 
that glucose absorption and glycolysis metabolites were increased after EV71 
infection. The glycolysis pathway was inhibited by knocking down ENO1 or the use 
of a glycolysis inhibitor (dichloroacetic acid [DCA]); and we found that EV71 
infection was inhibited by depleting ENO1 or using DCA. Our study indicates that 
EV71 may reprogram glucose metabolism by activating glycolysis, and EV71 
infection can be inhibited by interrupting the glycolysis pathway. ENO1 may be a 
potential target against EV71, and DCA could act as an inhibitor of EV71.

Engineering the Active Site Lid Dynamics to Improve the Catalytic Efficiency of 
Yeast Cytosine Deaminase.

Deng H(1)(2)(3), Qin M(1)(2), Liu Z(4), Yang Y(1)(2), Wang Y(1)(2), Yao L(1)(2).

Conformational dynamics is important for enzyme catalysis. However, engineering 
dynamics to achieve a higher catalytic efficiency is still challenging. In this 
work, we develop a new strategy to improve the activity of yeast cytosine 
deaminase (yCD) by engineering its conformational dynamics. Specifically, we 
increase the dynamics of the yCD C-terminal helix, an active site lid that 
controls the product release. The C-terminal is extended by a dynamical single 
α-helix (SAH), which improves the product release rate by up to ~8-fold, and the 
overall catalytic rate kcat by up to ~2-fold. It is also shown that the kcat 
increase is due to the favorable activation entropy change. The NMR H/D exchange 
data indicate that the conformational dynamics of the transition state analog 
complex increases as the helix is extended, elucidating the origin of the 
enhanced catalytic entropy. This study highlights a novel dynamics engineering 
strategy that can accelerate the overall catalysis through the entropy-driven 
mechanism.

The Effect of the Inclusion of Different Concentrates in Feed Rations on the 
Contents of Tocopherols, β-Carotene and Retinol in the Livers and Longissimus 
dorsi Muscles of Farm-Raised Fallow Deer (Dama dama L.).

Czurgiel S(1), Antoszkiewicz Z(1), Mazur-Kuśnirek M(1), Bogdaszewski M(2).

This study analyzed the chemical composition and contents of β-carotene, 
tocopherols and retinol in the longissimus dorsi (LD) muscles and livers of 
fallow deer (Dama dama L.) fed diets based on hay containing different 
concentrates (hay and oats—HO; hay, oats and protein concentrate—HOP; hay and 
pellets—HP). The provitamin and lipophilic vitamin contents in the samples of 
feed and animal tissues were determined by high-performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC). The contents of retinol were nearly two-fold higher (p < 
0.002) in the livers and many-fold higher in the LD muscles of fallow deer fed 
the HOP and HP diets. β-carotene was not identified in the livers or LD muscles 
of fallow deer. The concentrations of α-tocopherol and total tocopherols were 
higher in the livers and LD muscles of the animals that received the HO and HP 
diets, but the noted differences were not significant. The inclusion of various 
concentrates in the feed rations had no influence on the proximate chemical 
compositions of the livers or LD muscles of fallow deer.

Amelioration of ethanol-induced gastric ulcer in rats by quercetin: implication 
of Nrf2/HO1 and HMGB1/TLR4/NF-κB pathways.

Shams SGE(1), Eissa RG(2).

Gastric ulcer is a serious medical condition that can be developed due to an 
imbalance in the protective and destructive factors of the gastric system. 
Available therapies do not provide definite cure, thus, there is an urge to seek 
for alternative treatments. Quercetin is a natural flavonoid that possesses 
antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In the current study, the 
antiulcerogenic effect of quercetin in ethanol-induced gastric ulcer (EI-GU) rat 
model was compared to Antodine® (a reference drug), to elucidate the potential 
underlying mechanisms. Quercetin (50 mg/kg) and Antodine® (20 mg/kg) were given 
orally for one week post ulcer induction by ethanol. EI-GU was associated with 
downregulation of SOD, CAT, Nrf2 and HO1, and accompanied by upregulation of 
inflammatory markers (i.e., HMGB1, NF-κB and TNFα) and an increase in Bax/Bcl2 
ratio. Administration of quercetin resulted in a significant reduction in 
gastric volume in the stomach of ulcerative rats by 86% and a significant 
decrease in gastric lesion count by 3.5- folds, as compared with the ulcerative 
rats. Moreover, rats treated with quercetin showed upregulation of Nrf2 by 
3.3-fold change and in HO1 by 3.5-fold change when compared to ulcerated rats, 
and decreased HMGB1, TLR4, NF-κB p65 and TNF-α by 50%, 53%, 52.9% and 54.9%, 
respectively. Treatment of rats with quercetin reduced Bax and Bax/Bcl2 ratio 
and increased Bcl2 relative to ulcerated rats. Thus, it can be concluded that 
the ulcerogenic curative properties of quercetin were mediated by antioxidant, 
anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic activities.

Xanthan gum enhances peripheral blood CIK cells cytotoxicity in serum-free 
medium.

Huang H(1), Gong Z(1), Zhu X(1), Tan WS(1), Cai H(1).

As a water-soluble macromolecule polysaccharide, xanthan gum (XG) has several 
biological activities, such as antitumor, antiviral, and immunomodulatory 
function. However, the effect of XG on the proliferation and cytotoxicity of 
cytokines induced killer (CIK) cells is rarely studied. In this study, the 
effect of XG on CIK cells derived from peripheral blood was investigated by 
analyzing the expansion fold of total cells, phenotype, cytotoxicity, 
degranulation, and apoptosis in serum-free medium. The results showed that the 
expansion fold of total cells with 100 μg/ml XG which molecule weight is 
2.95 × 106  Da reached 4534.0 folds, significantly higher than that without XG 
(1299.0 folds, p < 0.05). The percentage of main effector cells-CD3+ CD56+ cells 
increased to 25.5% and the cytotoxic activity of CIK cells increased to 45.3%. 
The cell proportions of expression granzyme B and perforin that related to 
cytotoxicity in CIK cells reached 53.6% and 48.3%, respectively, significantly 
higher than 27.5% and 37.5% in the group without XG (p < 0.05). Collectively, XG 
could stimulate the ex vivo expansion of CIK cells and enhance the cytotoxicity 
of expanded CIK cells. The above results provide technical support for 
optimizing the expansion process of CIK cells ex vivo.

New Insights into the Evolution and Gene Structure of the Mitochondrial Carrier 
Family Unveiled by Analyzing the Frequent and Conserved Intron Positions.

Monné M(1)(2), Cianciulli A(1), Panaro MA(1), Calvello R(1), De Grassi A(1), 
Palmieri L(1)(3), Mitolo V(1), Palmieri F(1)(3).

Mitochondrial carriers (MCs) belong to a eukaryotic protein family of 
transporters that in higher organisms is called the solute carrier family 25 
(SLC25). All MCs have characteristic triplicated sequence repeats forming a 
3-fold symmetrical structure of a six-transmembrane α-helix bundle with a 
centrally located substrate-binding site. Biochemical characterization has shown 
that MCs altogether transport a wide variety of substrates but can be divided 
into subfamilies, each transporting a few specific substrates. We have 
investigated the intron positions in the human MC genes and their orthologs of 
highly diversified organisms. The results demonstrate that several intron 
positions are present in numerous MC sequences at the same specific points, of 
which some are 3-fold symmetry related. Many of these frequent intron positions 
are also conserved in subfamilies or in groups of subfamilies transporting 
similar substrates. The analyses of the frequent and conserved intron positions 
in MCs suggest phylogenetic relationships not only between close but also 
distant homologs as well as a possible involvement of the intron positions in 
the evolution of the substrate specificity diversification of the MC family 
members.

Novel Ganoderma triterpenoid saponins from the biotransformation-guided 
purification of a commercial Ganoderma extract.

Ding HY(1), Wang TY(2), Wu JY(3), Zhang YR(4), Chang TS(5).

Ganoderma sp. contains high amounts of diverse triterpenoids; however, few 
triterpenoid saponins could be isolated from the medicinal fungus. To produce 
novel Ganoderma triterpenoid saponins, biotransformation-guided purification 
(BGP) process was applied to a commercial Ganoderma extract. The commercial 
Ganoderma extract was partially separated into three fractions by preparative 
high-performance liquid chromatography, and the separated fractions were then 
directly biotransformed by a Bacillus glycosyltransferase (BsUGT489). One of the 
biotransformed products could be further purified and identified as a novel 
saponin: ganoderic acid C2 (GAC2)-3-O-β-glucoside by nucleic magnetic resonance 
(NMR) and mass spectral analyses. Based on the structure of the saponin, the 
predicted precursor should be the GAC2, which was confirmed to be biotransformed 
into four saponins, GAC2-3-O-β-glucoside, GAC2-3,15-O-β-diglucoside and two 
unknown GAC2 monoglucosides, revealed by NMR and mass spectral analyses. 
GAC2-3-O-β-glucoside and GAC2-3,15-O-β-diglucoside possessed 17-fold and 
200-fold higher aqueous solubility than that of GAC2, respectively. In addition, 
GAC2-3-O-β-glucoside retained the most anti-α-glucosidase activity of GAC2 and 
was comparable with that of the anti-diabetes drug (acarbose). The present study 
showed that the BGP process is an efficient strategy to survey novel and 
bioactive molecules from crude extracts of natural products.

Development of ternary nanoformulation comprising bee pollen-thymol oil extracts 
and chitosan nanoparticles for anti-inflammatory and anticancer applications.

Alshehri KM(1), Abdella EM(2).

Due to the beneficial nutritional and medicinal characteristics of bee honey and 
thymol oil as antioxidants, anti-inflammatory agents, and antibacterial agents, 
they have been used since ancient times. The current study aimed to construct a 
ternary nanoformulation (BPE-TOE-CSNPs NF) through the immobilization of the 
ethanolic extract of bee pollen (BPE) with thymol oil extract (TOE) into the 
matrix of chitosan nanoparticles (CSNPs). The antiproliferative activity of new 
NF (BPE-TOE-CSNPs) against HepG2 and MCF-7 cells was investigated. The 
BPE-TOE-CSNPs showed significant inhibitory activity for the production of the 
inflammatory cytokines in HepG2 and MCF-7, with p < 0.001 for both TNF-α and 
IL6. Moreover, the encapsulation of the BPE and TOE in CSNPs increased the 
efficacy of the treatment and the induction of valuable arrests for the S phase 
of the cell cycle. In addition, the new NF has a great capacity to trigger 
apoptotic mechanisms through caspase-3 expression upregulation in cancer cells 
by two-fold among HepG2 cell lines and nine-fold among MCF-7 which appeared to 
be more susceptible to the nanoformulation. Moreover, the nanoformulated 
compound has upregulated the expression of caspase-9 and P53 apoptotic 
mechanisms. This NF may shed light on its pharmacological actions by blocking 
specific proliferative proteins, inducing apoptosis, and interfering with the 
DNA replication process.

tissue.

The defining feature of Parkinson disease (PD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD) is 
the accumulation of alpha-synuclein (Asyn) fibrils in Lewy bodies and Lewy 
neurites. We developed and validated a novel method to amplify Asyn fibrils 
extracted from LBD postmortem tissue samples and used solid state nuclear 
magnetic resonance (SSNMR) studies to determine atomic resolution structure. 
Amplified LBD Asyn fibrils comprise two protofilaments with pseudo-2 1 helical 
screw symmetry, very low twist and an interface formed by antiparallel beta 
strands of residues 85-93. The fold is highly similar to the fold determined by 
a recent cryo-electron microscopy study for a minority population of twisted 
single protofilament fibrils extracted from LBD tissue. These results expand the 
structural landscape of LBD Asyn fibrils and inform further studies of disease 
mechanisms, imaging agents and therapeutics targeting Asyn.

Strong Neutralizing Antibody Responses to SARS-CoV-2 Variants Following a Single 
Vaccine Dose in Subjects With Previous SARS-CoV-2 Infection.

P(7), Julkunen I(5)(7), Palmu AA(8), Melin M(1).

BACKGROUND: Previous severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) infection primes the immune system; thus individuals who have 
recovered from infection have enhanced immune responses to subsequent 
vaccination (hybrid immunity). However, it remains unclear how well hybrid 
immunity induced by severe or mild infection can cross-neutralize emerging 
variants. We aimed to compare the strength and breadth of antibody responses in 
vaccinated recovered and uninfected subjects.
METHODS: We measured spike-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)G and neutralizing 
antibodies (NAbs) from vaccinated subjects including 320 with hybrid immunity 
and 20 without previous infection. From 29 subjects with a previous severe or 
mild infection, we also measured NAb responses against Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta 
(B.1.351), Delta (B.1.617.2), and Omicron (B.1.1.529/BA.1) variants following 
vaccination.
RESULTS: A single vaccine dose induced 2-fold higher anti-spike IgG 
concentrations and up to 4-fold higher neutralizing potency of antibodies in 
subjects with a previous infection compared with vaccinated subjects without a 
previous infection. Hybrid immunity was more enhanced after a severe than a mild 
infection, with sequentially decreasing NAb titers against Alpha, Beta, Delta, 
and Omicron variants. We found similar IgG concentrations in subjects with a 
previous infection after 1 or 2 vaccine doses.
CONCLUSIONS: Hybrid immunity induced strong IgG responses, particularly after 
severe infection. However, the NAb titers were low against heterologous 
variants, especially against Omicron.

Improved sensitivity of the anti-microcystin-LR ELISA using phage-displayed 
alpha-type anti-idiotypic nanobody.

Anti-idiotypic antibodies (Ab2) are valuable tools that can be used for a better 
understanding of molecular mimicry and the immunological network. In this work, 
we showed a new application of a phage-displayed alpha-type Ab2 (Ab2α) to 
improve the sensitivity of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 
detecting cyanobacterial toxin microcystin-LR (MC-LR). A monoclonal antibody 
(mAb) against MC-LR was used as an antigen to isolate binders in a camelid 
nanobody library. After three rounds of panning, three unique clones with strong 
binding against anti-MC-LR mAbs were isolated. These clones could specifically 
bind to anti-MC-LR mAbs without influencing mAbs binding with MC-LR, meaning 
these clones were Ab2αs. Based on the signal amplification effect of phage coat 
proteins and the non-competitive nature of Ab2α, a novel competitive ELISA 
method for MC-LR was established with a phage-displayed Ab2α. It showed that the 
phage-displayed Ab2α greatly enhanced the ELISA signal and sensitivity of the 
method was improved 3.5-fold to the conventional one. Combining with the 
optimization of pre-incubation time, the optimized ELISA decreased its limit of 
detection (LOD) from 4.5 ng/mL to 0.8 ng/mL (5.6-fold improvement). This new 
application of Ab2α may potentially be employed to improve the sensitivity of 
immunoassays for other environmental pollutants.

Live mucosal vaccination stimulates potent protection via varied CD4(+) and 
CD8(+) T cell subsets against wild-type Brucella melitensis 16M challenge.

Goodwin ZI(1), Yang X(1), Hoffman C(1), Pascual DW(1).

Re-emerging zoonotic pathogen Brucella spp. continues to impact developing 
countries and persists in expanding populations of wildlife species in the US, 
constantly threatening infection of our domestic herds. The development of 
improved animal and human vaccines remains a priority. In this study, immunity 
to a novel live attenuated B. melitensis strain, termed znBM-mC, was 
characterized. An oral prime, intranasal (IN) boost strategy conferred exquisite 
protection against pulmonary challenge, with wild-type (wt) B. melitensis 
providing nearly complete protection in the lungs and spleens from brucellae 
colonization. Vaccination with znBM-mC showed an IFN-γ+ CD8+ T-cell bias in the 
lungs as opposed to Rev 1-vaccinated mice showing IFN-γ+ CD4+ T-cell 
inclination. Lung CD4+ and CD8+ effector memory T cells (TEMs) increased over 
200-fold; and lung CD4+ and CD8+ resident memory T cells (TRMs) increased more 
than 250- and 150-fold, respectively. These T cells served as the primary 
producers of IFN-γ in the lungs, which was essential for vaccine clearance and 
the predominant cytokine generated pre-and post-challenge with wt B. melitensis 
16M; znBM-mC growth could not be arrested in IFN-γ-/- mice. Increases in lung 
TNF-α and IL-17 were also induced, with IL-17 being mostly derived from CD4+ T 
cells. Vaccination of CD4-/-, CD8-/-, and B6 mice with znBM-mC conferred full 
protection in the lungs and spleens post-pulmonary challenge with virulent B. 
melitensis; vaccination of IL-17-/- mice resulted in the protection of the 
lungs, but not the spleen. These data demonstrate the efficacy of mucosal 
vaccine administration for the generation of protective memory T cells against 
wt B. melitensis.

Oral administration of sea cucumber (Stichopus japonicus) protein exerts wound 
healing effects via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.

Sun JH(1), Song S(1), Yang JF(1).

This study aimed to investigate the effect of the oral administration of sea 
cucumber protein (SCP) on wound healing. SCP was isolated and purified from the 
body wall of Stichopus japonicus. A mouse skin incision model was operated on to 
evaluate the wound repair effect of SCP. The histological changes in the skin at 
the wound sites of BALB/c mice were observed by staining with haematoxylin and 
eosin (H&E) and Masson's trichrome. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) was used to analyze the expression of inflammatory cytokines in BALB/c 
mice. The boost cell migration ability was detected by a scratch assay after 
HaCaT cells were cultured with digested SCP (dSCP). Western blotting and RT-PCR 
assays were performed to determine the mechanism of SCP promoting wound healing. 
As a result, the wound healing rate in the SCP high dose group was 1.3-fold, 
compared to that in the blank group on day 14. Also, increased epidermal 
thickness and 1.79-fold collagen deposition contrasted with the blank group. 
Additionally, SCP could up-regulate the levels of pro-inflammatory factors 
(IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) from day 3 to 7 firstly and decreased from day 7 to 14. 
IL-8 expression continuously decreased while the level of anti-inflammatory 
factor (IL-10) increased during the healing stage. Furthermore, the cell closure 
area reached 67% after being treated with 50 μg mL-1 of dSCP for 48 h. Cell 
proliferation was associated with the dSCP-activated PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. 
Taken together, SCP can be orally used as an effective agent for wound repair.

Rapid Scan Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Is a Suitable Tool to 
Study Intermolecular Interactions of Intrinsically Disordered Protein.

Dröden J(1), Drescher M(1).

Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are involved in most crucial cellular 
processes. However, they lack a well-defined fold hampering the investigation of 
their structural ensemble and interactions. Suitable biophysical methods able to 
manage their inherent flexibility and broad conformational ensemble are scarce. 
Here, we used rapid scan (RS) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy 
to study the intermolecular interactions of the IDP α-synuclein (aS). aS 
aggregation and fibril deposition is the hallmark of Parkinson's disease, and 
specific point mutations, among them A30P and A53T, were linked to the early 
onset of the disease. To understand the pathological processes, research 
intensively investigates aS aggregation kinetics, which was reported to be 
accelerated in the presence of ethanol. Conventional techniques fail to capture 
these fast processes due to their limited time resolution and, thus, lose 
kinetic information. We have demonstrated that RS EPR spectroscopy is suitable 
for studying aS aggregation by resolving underlying kinetics and highlighting 
differences in fibrillization behavior. RS EPR spectroscopy outperforms 
traditional EPR methods in terms of sensitivity by a factor of 5 in our case 
while significantly reducing data acquisition time. Thus, we were able to sample 
short time intervals capturing single events taking place during the aggregation 
process. Further studies will therefore be able to shed light on biological 
processes proceeding on fast time scales.

Comprehensive screening strategy coupled with structure-guided engineering of 
l-threonine aldolase from Pseudomonas putida for enhanced catalytic efficiency 
towards l-threo-4-methylsulfonylphenylserine.

Li L(1), Zhang R(1), Xu Y(1), Zhang W(2).

l-Threonine aldolases (TAs) can catalyze aldol condensation reactions to form 
β-hydroxy-α-amino acids, but afford unsatisfactory conversion and poor 
stereoselectivity at the Cβ position. In this study, a directed evolution 
coupling high-throughput screening method was developed to screen more efficient 
l-TA mutants based on their aldol condensation activity. A mutant library with 
over 4000 l-TA mutants from Pseudomonas putida were obtained by random 
mutagenesis. About 10% of mutants retained activity toward 
4-methylsulfonylbenzaldehyde, with five site mutations (A9L, Y13K, H133N, E147D, 
and Y312E) showing higher activity. Iterative combinatorial mutant 
A9V/Y13K/Y312R catalyzed l-threo-4-methylsulfonylphenylserine with a 72% 
conversion and 86% diastereoselectivity, representing 2.3-fold and 5.1-fold 
improvements relative to the wild-type. Molecular dynamics simulations 
illustrated that additional hydrogen bonds, water bridge force, hydrophobic 
interactions, and π-cation interactions were present in the A9V/Y13K/Y312R 
mutant compared with the wild-type to reshape the substrate-binding pocket, 
resulting in a higher conversion and Cβ stereoselectivity. This study provides a 
useful strategy for engineering TAs to resolve the low Cβ stereoselectivity 
problem and contributes to the industrial application of TAs.

Enzyme-Mimicking Materials from Designed Self-Assembly of Lysine-Rich Peptides 
and G-Quadruplex DNA/Hemin DNAzyme: Charge Effect of the Key Residues on the 
Catalytic Functions.

Sun H(1), Wu H(1), Teng Q(1), Liu Y(1), Wang H(2), Wang ZG(1).

In enzymatic active sites, the essential functional groups are spatially 
arranged as a result of the enzyme three-dimensional folding, which leads to 
remarkable catalytic properties. We are inspired to self-assemble the polylysine 
peptides with guanine-rich DNA and hemin as cofactor to fabricate the 
peroxidase-mimicking catalytic nanomaterials. The DNA can fold into G-quadruplex 
to provide a supramolecular scaffold and a nucleobase for supporting and 
coordinating hemin, and the polylysine provides amine as distal groups to 
promote the H2O2 adsorption to the iron of hemin. The polylysine and DNA 
components synergistically accelerated the hemin-catalyzed reactions, and the 
complex containing ε-polylysine exhibited higher activity than α-polylysine. 
This activity difference is attributed to the higher pKa value and more 
susceptible protonation of amine of ε-polylysine than α-polylysine. The 
ε-polylysine/DNA/hemin had similar coordination states of hemin and 
conformations of the components to α-polylysine/DNA/hemin but accelerated the 
formation of the intermediate compound I faster than α-polylysine. Theoretical 
simulation reveals that the unprotonated NH2 behaved like a base catalyst, 
similar to His-42 residue in the natural heme pocket, while the protonated NH3+ 
acted as an acid, which indicated that the base catalyst on the distal side of 
the hemin pocket is more active than the acid. This work provides an avenue to 
control the distribution of the catalytic residues in an enzyme-like active site 
and to understand the roles of the key residues of native enzymes.

The transcription factor FoxP3 can fold into two dimerization states with 
divergent implications for regulatory T cell function and immune homeostasis.

Comment in
    Immunity. 2022 Aug 9;55(8):1329-1331.

FoxP3 is an essential transcription factor (TF) for immunologic homeostasis, but 
how it utilizes the common forkhead DNA-binding domain (DBD) to perform its 
unique function remains poorly understood. We here demonstrated that unlike 
other known forkhead TFs, FoxP3 formed a head-to-head dimer using a unique 
linker (Runx1-binding region [RBR]) preceding the forkhead domain. Head-to-head 
dimerization conferred distinct DNA-binding specificity and created a docking 
site for the cofactor Runx1. RBR was also important for proper folding of the 
forkhead domain, as truncation of RBR induced domain-swap dimerization of 
forkhead, which was previously considered the physiological form of FoxP3. 
Rather, swap-dimerization impaired FoxP3 function, as demonstrated with the 
disease-causing mutation R337Q, whereas a swap-suppressive mutation largely 
rescued R337Q-mediated functional impairment. Altogether, our findings suggest 
that FoxP3 can fold into two distinct dimerization states: head-to-head 
dimerization representing functional specialization of an ancient DBD and swap 
dimerization associated with impaired functions.

Beta(2) -agonist increases skeletal muscle interleukin 6 production and release 
in response to resistance exercise in men.

Hostrup M(1), Knudsen JG(2), Kristensen CM(2), Jessen S(1), Pilegaard H(2), 
Bangsbo J(1).

OBJECTIVE: Several tissues produce and release interleukin-6 (IL-6) in response 
to beta2 -adrenergic stimulation with selective agonists (beta2 -agonists). 
Moreover, exercise stimulates muscle IL-6 production, but whether beta2 
-agonists regulate skeletal muscle production and release of IL-6 in humans in 
association with exercise remains to be clarified. Thus, we investigated leg 
IL-6 release in response to beta2 -agonist salbutamol in lean young men at rest 
and in recovery from resistance exercise.
DESIGN: The study employed a randomized controlled crossover design, where 
12 men ingested either salbutamol (16 mg) or placebo for 4 days, followed by the 
last dose (24 mg) administered 1½ h before exercise. Arterial and femoral venous 
plasma IL-6 as well as femoral artery blood flow was measured before and ½-5 h 
in recovery from quadriceps muscle resistance exercise. Furthermore, vastus 
lateralis muscle biopsies were collected ½ and 5 h after exercise for 
determination of mRNA levels of IL-6 and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α.
RESULTS: Average leg IL-6 release was 1.7-fold higher (p = 0.01) for salbutamol 
than placebo, being 138 ± 76 and 79 ± 66 pg min-1 (mean ± SD) for salbutamol and 
placebo, respectively, but IL-6 release was not significantly different between 
treatments within specific sampling points at rest and after exercise. Muscle 
IL-6 mRNA was 1.5- and 1.7-fold higher (p = 0.001) for salbutamol than placebo ½ 
and 5 h after exercise, respectively, whereas no significant treatment 
differences were observed for TNF-α mRNA.
CONCLUSIONS: Beta2 -adrenergic stimulation with high doses of the selective 
beta2 -agonist salbutamol, preceeded by 4 consecutive daily doses, induces 
transcription of IL-6 in skeletal muscle in response to resistance exercise, and 
increases muscle IL-6 release in lean individuals.

Determination of the Cytotoxicity and Antibiofilm Potential Effect of Equisetum 
arvense Silver Nanoparticles.

Akar Z(1), Akay S(2), Ejder N(3), Özad Düzgün A(4).

This study aimed to synthesize and characterize silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) by 
green synthesis from Equisetum arvense (Ea) extracts and to investigate their 
cytotoxicity, antibiofilm activity, and α-glucosidase enzyme inhibition. Diverse 
characterization techniques were applied to verify the production of 
nanoparticles. SEM examination confirmed that the size of nanoparticles is in 
the range of 40-60 nm. Also, interactions between silver and natural compounds 
of plant extract were confirmed through FT-IR and EDX analyses. It was 
determined that Equisetum arvense silver nanoparticles had antibiofilm activity 
against three different clinical strains with high biofilm-forming ability. 
AgNPs reduced the biofilm-forming capacity of clinical A. baumannii isolate with 
strong biofilm-forming capacity by approximately twofold, while the capacity of 
clinical K.pneumonaie and E.coli isolates decreased by 1.5 and 1.2 fold, 
respectively. The α-glucosidase enzyme inhibition potential of the AgNPs, which 
is determined as 93.50%, was higher than the plant extract with, and the α- 
30.37%. MTT was performed to assess whether incubation of nanoparticles with 
A549 and ARPE-19 cell lines affected their viability, and a dramatic reduction 
in cell growth inhibition of both A549 and ARPE-19 cells was observed. It has 
been shown that A549 cells treated with 200 and 150 µg/mL nanoparticles had less 
cell proliferation compared to control cells at 24-h and 48-h incubation time. 
According to these results, Ea-derived AgNPs appear to have potential anticancer 
activity against A549 cancer cells. Investigating the effects of green synthesis 
nanoparticles on microbial biofilm and various tumors may be important for 
developing new therapies. The outcomes of this study have showed that 
Ea-AgNPsmay have a high potential both in the treatment of pathogenic strains 
that form biofilms, as well as in anticancer therapy use.

Phenoxy pendant isatins as potent α-glucosidase inhibitors: reciprocal 
carbonyl⋯carbonyl interactions, antiparallel π⋯π stacking driven solid state 
self-assembly and biological evaluation.

Mehreen S(1), Zia M(2), Khan A(3), Hussain J(4), Ullah S(3), Anwar MU(3), 
Al-Harrasi A(3), Naseer MM(1).

Carbonyl-carbonyl (CO⋯CO) interactions are recently explored noncovalent 
interactions of significant interest owing to their role in the stability of 
biomacromolecules. Currently, substantial efforts are being made to understand 
the nature of these interactions. In this study, twelve phenoxy pendant isatins 
1-12 have been evaluated for their α-glucosidase inhibitory potential in 
addition to the analysis of X-ray single crystals of 4 and 9. Both compounds 4 
and 9 showed intriguing and unique self-assembled structures. The CO⋯CO and 
antiparallel displaced π⋯π stacking interactions are mainly involved in the 
formation of 1D-stair like supramolecular chains of 4 whereas antiparallel π⋯π 
stacking interactions drive the formation of 1D-columnar stacks of 9. These 
compounds not only highlight the potential of the isatin moiety in forming 
strong CO⋯CO and antiparallel π⋯π stacking interactions but also are interesting 
models to provide considerable insight into the nature of these interactions. 
The in vitro biological studies revealed that all twelve phenoxy pendant isatins 
1-12 are highly potent inhibitors of α-glucosidase enzyme with IC50 values 
ranging from 5.32 ± 0.17 to 150.13 ± 0.62 μM, showing many fold more potent 
activity than the standard drug, acarbose (IC50 = 873.34 ± 1.67). Easy access 
and high α-glucosidase inhibition potential of these phenoxy pendant isatins 
1-12 provide an attractive platform for finding more effective medication for 
controlling postprandial hyperglycemia.

C/EBPα promotes triacylglycerol synthesis via regulating PPARG promoter activity 
in goat mammary epithelial cells.

Tian H(1), Luo J(1), Guo P(1), Li C(1), Zhang X(2).

CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα) is the key transcription factor 
involved in lipid metabolism, however, the role of C/EBPα in milk fat synthesis 
of dairy goats remains unknown. The objective of the present research was to 
clarify the function of C/EBPα in goat mammary epithelial cells (GMECs) and its 
impact on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) promoter 
activity. In this study, C/EBPα overexpression increased its mRNA and protein 
levels by 42-fold and 6-fold, respectively. In contrast, transfecting siRNA 
targeting C/EBPα decreased its mRNA level to 20% and protein abundance to 80% of 
the basal level. The contents of lipid droplets, triacylglycerol (TAG), and 
cholesterol were increased (P < 0.05) in C/EBPα-overexpressing GMECs, and 
knockdown of C/EBPα led to the opposite results. Overexpression of C/EBPα 
significantly increased the expression levels of genes involved in TAG synthesis 
(AGPAT6, DGAT2, P < 0.01), lipid droplet formation (PLIN2, P < 0.01), and fatty 
acid synthesis (FADS2, P < 0.05; ELOVL6, P < 0.01). Knockdown of C/EBPα 
decreased (P < 0.05) the expression levels of AGPAT6, DGAT1, DGAT2, PLIN2, 
FADS2, and ELOVL6. C/EBPα upregulated the expression level of PPARG (P < 0.05), 
and four C/EBPα binding regions were identified in the PPARG promoter at -1,112 
to -1,102 bp, -734 to -724 bp, -248 to -238 bp, and -119 to -109 bp. Knockdown 
of C/EBPα reduced (P < 0.05) the PPARG promoter activity when the C/EBPα binding 
regions were mutated at -1,112 to -1,102 bp, -734 to -724 bp, and -248 to -238 
bp locations of the promoter. However, the promoter activity did not change when 
the mutation was located at -119 bp. In conclusion, our results suggest that 
C/EBPα can promote TAG synthesis in GMECs through its effects on mRNA abundance 
of genes related to lipid metabolism and regulation of the PPARG promoter 
activity via C/EBPα binding regions.

Plain Language Summary: Goat milk is beneficial for human health because of its 
nutritional value, especially milk fat, which is plentiful in goat milk. The 
molecular mechanism of milk fat synthesis is of great importance for developing 
processing technology and using genetic approaches to improve goat milk quality. 
The purpose of this study was to identify the role of CCAAT/enhancer binding 
protein α (C/EBPα) in goat mammary gland epithelial cells (GMECs) to provide 
support for understanding the mechanism of milk fat synthesis. Overexpression of 
C/EBPα increased the contents of lipid droplets, triacylglycerol, and 
cholesterol in GMECs. The expression levels of genes related to lipid metabolism 
were influenced after C/EBPα overexpression or inhibition. The promoter 
transcriptional activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, 
which is the key transcription factor in milk fat synthesis, was regulated by 
C/EBPα through its binding regions. Our results indicate that C/EBPα affects 
lipid metabolism in GMECs by regulating PPARG transcription. This study provides 
support for milk fat synthesis regulation and improvement of milk quality in 
goats.

Radiometric Assay of ABHD2 Activity.

Fazio D(1), Criscuolo E(2)(3), Maccarrone M(2)(4).

The α,β-hydrolase fold-containing protein 2 (ABHD2) is a serine hydrolase, 
responsible for the cleavage of endogenous 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). ABHD2 
is activated by progesterone, thus, it is considered a nonnuclear receptor of 
this steroid hormone that terminates its biological effects. The products of 
ABHD2-catalyzed cleavage by the natural substrate 2-AG are glycerol and 
arachidonic acid; here, instead of 2-AG, the radioactive substrate 
2-oleoyl-[3H]glycerol has been used as already done in various acylglycerol 
lipase activity assays. The amount of [3H]glycerol released allows to measure 
ABHD2 enzymatic activity.

Machine Learning Guided Discovery of Non-Hemolytic Membrane Disruptive 
Anticancer Peptides.

Zakharova E(1), Orsi M(1), Capecchi A(1), Reymond JL(1).

Most antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and anticancer peptides (ACPs) fold into 
membrane disruptive cationic amphiphilic α-helices, many of which are however 
also unpredictably hemolytic and toxic. Here we exploited the ability of 
recurrent neural networks (RNN) to distinguish active from inactive and 
non-hemolytic from hemolytic AMPs and ACPs to discover new non-hemolytic ACPs. 
Our discovery pipeline involved: 1) sequence generation using either a 
generative RNN or a genetic algorithm, 2) RNN classification for activity and 
hemolysis, 3) selection for sequence novelty, helicity and amphiphilicity, and 
4) synthesis and testing. Experimental evaluation of thirty-three peptides 
resulted in eleven active ACPs, four of which were non-hemolytic, with 
properties resembling those of the natural ACP lasioglossin III. These 
experiments show the first example of direct machine learning guided discovery 
of non-hemolytic ACPs.

Peptide macrocyclisation via late-stage reductive amination.

Bell HJ(1)(2), Malins LR(1)(2).

A two-component reductive amination approach to the synthesis of peptide 
macrocycles is reported which leverages the inherent reactivity of proteinogenic 
amine nucleophiles. Unprotected peptides bearing α-amine and side chain amine 
motifs undergo two-fold reductive amination reactions with 
2,6-pyridinedialdehyde linkers in aqueous media to afford macrocyclic peptide 
products with backbone embedded pyridine motifs. Dialdehyde staples bearing 
valuable azide and alkyne handles also enable the post-cyclisation modification 
of peptides using copper-catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) chemistry.

Honey-Propolis-Engineered Collagen Peptides as Promising Wound-Healing Matrix in 
Mouse Model.

Ibrahim HM(1)(2), Thangavelu M(3)(4), Khalifa A(1)(5).

In this study, collagen hydrolysates (CHDs) were fabricated with honey-propolis 
wax (HPW), structurally modified as a sponge matrix, and experimentalized on 
wound healing in a mouse model. The scaffold was characterized by means of in 
vitro enzymatic degradation; in vitro HPW release; and in vivo wound-healing 
mouse model, wound-healing-specific RNA, transcripts, and protein markers. The 
functional activity of the HPW extracted from raw propolis was determined using 
total flavonoids, antioxidant scavenging assays, and anti-hemolytic principles. 
The results indicated that HPW had a high flavonoid content (20 μg/mL of wax) 
and antioxidant activities. The effective concentration (EC50) of HPW was 
estimated (28 mg/mL) and was then used in the subsequent in vivo experiments. 
Additionally, the dopped mixture of CHDs and HPW substantially enhanced the 
wound-healing process and regulated wound biochemical markers such as 
hexoseamine and melondialdehyde. CHDs- HPW upregulated the expression of growth 
factors including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (2.3-fold), 
fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) (1.7-fold), and 
transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) (3.1-fold), indicating their potential 
capacity to perform wound re-epithelialization and the loading of ground tissue. 
Pro-inflammatory markers IL-1 β (51 pg/mL) and TNF-α (220 pg/mL) were 
significantly reduced in the CHD-HPW-treated wound. These interesting results 
were further confirmed using mRNA and protein growth factors from the wound, 
which enhanced the load of collagen-I in the wound site. In conclusion, CHDs-HPW 
exhibited a significant reduction in inflammation and inflammatory markers and 
helped to obtain a faster wound-healing process in a mouse model. The newly 
engineered biosponge could be developed as a promising therapeutic approach for 
the regeneration and repair of damaged human skin in the future.

Monitoring Resistance and Biochemical Studies of Three Egyptian Field Strains of 
Spodoptera littoralis (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) to Six Insecticides.

Moustafa MAM(1), Moteleb RIA(2), Ghoneim YF(2), Hafez SS(2), Ali RE(2), Eweis 
EEA(1), Hassan NN(1).

BACKGROUND: Spodoptera littoralis (Boisd.) is a prominent agricultural insect 
pest that has developed resistance to a variety of insecticide classes. In this 
study, the resistance of three field strains of S. littoralis, collected over 
three consecutive seasons (2018 to 2020) from three Egyptian Governorates 
(El-Fayoum, Behera and Kafr El-Shiekh), to six insecticides was monitored.
METHODS: Laboratory bioassays were carried out using the leaf-dipping method to 
examine the susceptibility of the laboratory and field strains to the tested 
insecticides. Activities of detoxification enzymes were determined in an attempt 
to identify resistance mechanisms.
RESULTS: The results showed that LC50 values of the field strains ranged from 
0.0089 to 132.24 mg/L, and the corresponding resistance ratio (RR) ranged from 
0.17 to 4.13-fold compared with the susceptible strain. Notably, low resistance 
developed to spinosad in all field strains, and very low resistance developed to 
alpha-cypermethrin and chlorpyrifos. On the other hand, no resistance developed 
to methomyl, hexaflumeron or Bacillus thuringiensis. The determination of 
detoxification enzymes, including carboxylesterases (α- and β-esterase), mixed 
function oxidase (MFO) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST), or the target site 
of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), revealed that the three field strains had 
significantly different activity levels compared with the susceptible strain.
CONCLUSION: Our findings, along with other tactics, are expected to help with 
the resistance management of S. littoralis in Egypt.

Intra- and Interexaminer Measurement Variability Analysis of an Orthodontic 
Gauge Device to Determine Incisor Occlusal Surface Angles in the Horse.

Kau S(1), Motter KS(1), Moser VJ(1), Kunz JR(2), Pellachin M(3), Hartl B(1).

Incisor malocclusions are common in horses. As yet, an evidence-based 
understanding of incisor occlusal surface angle dynamics and normocclusal range 
is missing. Orthodontic measuring devices could help unravel this information 
objectively but imply measurement validation. We evaluated intra- and 
interexaminer variability of repeated sagittal and transversal incisor occlusal 
surface angle measures using a commercial orthodontic gauge device (MaPHorse1). 
Five examiners (two experienced, three inexperienced) measured six cadaver heads 
on 2 consecutive days in a blinded block-randomization design, resulting in 16 
measures per examiner*head. Sagittal and transversal angle measures revealed low 
intraexaminer variability at scale-level independent mean SDs of α 0.58° and α 
0.69°, respectively. Sagittal angle measures associate with low interexaminer 
variability, showing small mean angle differences (max. α 0.51° ± 0.35°), small 
scatter, and more consistent data reproducibility. Despite comparable mean 
interexaminer differences, the spread of transversal angle measures was 
relevantly higher using the proposed landmarks (average 2.2-fold higher 
interquartile range). The measurement performance of experienced and 
inexperienced examiners did not systematically differ. The time required for 
individual measurements was already comparable after 24/96 repetitions. This 
instrument may help deciphering sagittal angle normocclusal range and 
orthognathic dynamics and, with a proposed procedural amendment, transversal 
angle as well.

Expansion of iNKT Cells Promotes Liver Repair Following Hepatic Ischemia 
Reperfusion Injury.

Goto T(1)(2)(3), Ito Y(1)(2), Nishizawa N(4), Kuroda YU(1), Nakamoto S(1)(4), 
Hosono K(1)(2), Naitoh T(3), Hiki N(5), Amano H(6)(2).

BACKGROUND/AIM: Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are involved in the 
initiation and resolution of inflammatory responses. We previously reported that 
activated iNKT cells facilitate liver repair after hepatic ischemia reperfusion 
(I/R) injury by accelerating macrophage polarization during the early phase of 
hepatic I/R injury. Upon activation with α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer), iNKT 
cell numbers transiently decrease before increasing within 72 h of stimulation. 
In the present study, we examined the role of expanded hepatic iNKT cells in the 
late phase of hepatic I/R injury.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: iNKT cells were activated by intraperitoneal injection of 
α-GalCer in male C57/BL6 mice at the induction of hepatic ischemia followed by 
reperfusion.
RESULTS: Numbers of activated hepatic iNKT cells immediately diminished after 
hepatic I/R and reached minimal levels at 24 h and 48 h post-reperfusion. 
Numbers of hepatic iNKT cells then increased at 72 h and 96 h post-reperfusion 
to levels approximately 2-fold higher than in mice that underwent a sham 
operation. Liver repair as demonstrated by decreased necrotic area and increased 
expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was enhanced in 
α-GalCer-treated mice at 96 h post-reperfusion. Interleukin (IL)-13 production 
by proliferating iNKT cells was observed at 96 h post-reperfusion, which was 
associated with enhanced liver repair and increased numbers of reparative 
macrophages.
CONCLUSION: Repopulation of hepatic iNKT cells promotes liver repair by 
stimulating macrophage phenotype switching in the late phase of hepatic I/R 
injury.

Inhibition of Canonical Wnt Signaling Promotes Ex Vivo Maintenance and 
Proliferation of Hematopoietic Stem Cells in Zebrafish.

Kimura K(1), Yamamori S(1), Hazawa M(2)(3)(4), Kobayashi-Sun J(4)(5), Kondo 
M(1), Wong RW(2)(3)(4), Kobayashi I(4).

The maintenance and proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are tightly 
regulated by their niches in the bone marrow. The analysis of niche cells or 
stromal cell lines that can support HSCs has facilitated the finding of novel 
supporting factors for HSCs. Despite large efforts in the murine bone marrow; 
however, HSC expansion is still difficult ex vivo, highlighting the need for new 
approaches to elucidate the molecular elements that regulate HSCs. The zebrafish 
provides a unique model to study hematopoietic niches as HSCs are maintained in 
the kidney, allowing for a parallel view of hematopoietic niches over evolution. 
Here, using a stromal cell line from the zebrafish kidney, zebrafish kidney 
stromal (ZKS), we uncover that an inhibitor of canonical Wnt signaling, 
IWR-1-endo, is a potent regulator of HSCs. Coculture assays revealed that ZKS 
cells were in part supportive of maintenance, but not expansion, of 
gata2a:GFP+runx1:mCherry+ (gata2a+runx1+) HSCs. Transcriptome analysis revealed 
that, compared with candidate niche cells in the kidney, ZKS cells weakly 
expressed HSC maintenance factor genes, thpo and cxcl12, but highly expressed 
canonical Wnt ligand genes, wnt1, 7bb, and 9a. Thpo supplementation in ZKS 
culture slightly increased, but inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling by 
IWR-1-endo treatment largely increased the number of gata2a+runx1+ cells 
(>2-fold). Moreover, we found that gata2a+runx1+ cells can be maintained by 
supplementing both IWR-1-endo and Thpo without stromal cells. Collectively, our 
data provide evidence that IWR-1-endo can be used as a novel supporting factor 
for HSCs.

Crystal structure determination of the halogenase CtcP from Streptomyces 
aureofaciens.

Yin L(1).

Chlortetracycline (CTC), a derivative of tetracycline (TC), is a broadly used 
antibiotic that inhibits the synthesis of bacterial proteins by competing with 
the A-site tRNA on ribosomes. A recent study showed that during the biosynthesis 
of CTC in Streptomyces aureofaciens, the halogenase CtcP catalyzes the final 
chlorination reaction and transforms TC into CTC. However, the structure of this 
fundamental enzyme is still lacking. Here, selenomethionine-derivatized CtcP 
from S. aureofaciens was overexpressed and purified and its structure was 
determined at 2.7 Å resolution. The structure of CtcP reveals the conserved 
monooxygenase domain shared by all flavin-dependent halogenases and a unique 
C-terminal domain. Although FAD was not observed in the structure, the 
monooxygenase domain has a conserved FAD-binding pocket and active center. The 
C-terminal domain displays an α-helical bundle fold, which could contribute to 
substrate specificity. This work provides a molecular basis for enzyme 
engineering to improve the industrial production of CTC.

Mutations in AcrR and RNA Polymerase Confer High-Level Resistance to 
Psoralen-UVA Irradiation.

Worley TK(1), Weber EA(1), Acott JD(1), Shimpi RS(1), Cole JM(1), Courcelle 
CT(1), Courcelle J(1).

DNA interstrand cross-links, such as those formed by psoralen-UVA irradiation, 
are highly toxic lesions in both humans and bacteria, with a single lesion being 
lethal in Escherichia coli. Despite the lack of effective repair, human cancers 
and bacteria can develop resistance to cross-linking treatments, although the 
mechanisms of resistance remain poorly defined. Here, we subjected E. coli to 
repeated psoralen-UVA exposure to isolate three independently derived strains 
that were >10,000-fold more resistant to this treatment than the parental 
strain. Analysis of these strains identified gain-of-function mutations in the 
transcriptional regulator AcrR and the alpha subunit of RNA polymerase that 
together could account for the resistance of these strains. Resistance conferred 
by the AcrR mutation is mediated at least in part through the regulation of the 
AcrAB-TolC efflux pump. Resistance via mutations in the alpha subunit of RNA 
polymerase occurs through a still-uncharacterized mechanism that has an additive 
effect with mutations in AcrR. Both acrR and rpoA mutations reduced cross-link 
formation in vivo. We discuss potential mechanisms in relation to the ability to 
repair and survive interstrand DNA cross-links. IMPORTANCE Psoralen DNA 
interstrand cross-links are highly toxic lesions with antimicrobial and 
anticancer properties. Despite the lack of effective mechanisms for repair, 
cells can become resistant to cross-linking agents through mechanisms that 
remain poorly defined. We derived resistant mutants and identified that two 
gain-of-function mutations in AcrR and the alpha subunit of RNA polymerase 
confer high levels of resistance to E. coli treated with psoralen-UVA. 
Resistance conferred by AcrR mutations occurs through regulation of the 
AcrAB-TolC efflux pump, has an additive effect with RNA polymerase mutations, 
acts by reducing the formation of cross-links in vivo, and reveals a novel 
mechanism by which these environmentally and clinically important agents are 
processed by the cell.

Subnanomolar Cathepsin S Inhibitors with High Selectivity: Optimizing Covalent 
Reversible α-Fluorovinylsulfones and α-Sulfonates as Potential Immunomodulators 
in Cancer.

Fuchs N(1), Meta M(1), Lantzberg B(2), Bros M(3), Ling Kuan S(2), Weil T(2), 
Schirmeister T(1).

The cysteine protease cathepsin S (CatS) is overexpressed in many tumors. It is 
known to be involved in tumor progression as well as antigen processing in 
antigen-presenting cells (APC). Recent evidence suggests that silencing CatS 
improves the anti-tumor immune response in several cancers. Therefore, CatS is 
an interesting target to modulate the immune response in these diseases. Here, 
we present a series of covalent-reversible CatS inhibitors based on the 
α-fluorovinylsulfone and -sulfonate warheads. We optimized two lead structures 
by molecular docking approaches, resulting in 22 final compounds which were 
evaluated in fluorometric enzyme assays for CatS inhibition and for selectivity 
towards the off-targets CatB and CatL. The most potent inhibitor in the series 
has subnanomolar affinity (Ki =0.08 nM) and more than 100,000-fold selectivity 
towards cathepsins B and L. These new reversible and non-cytotoxic inhibitors 
could serve as interesting leads to develop new immunomodulators in cancer 
therapy.

Liquid crystalline nanoparticles enable a multifunctional approach for topical 
psoriasis therapy by co-delivering triptolide and siRNAs.

Silvestrini AVP(1), Garcia Praça F(1), Leite MN(2), de Abreu Fantini MC(3), 
Frade MAC(2), Badra Bentley MVL(4).

Liquid crystalline nanoparticles (LCNs) are an attractive drugs topical delivery 
system due to the great internal ordering, wide interfacial area and structural 
similarities with the skin. In this work, LCNs were designed to encapsulate 
triptolide (TP) and to complex on its surface small interfering RNAs (siRNA) 
targeting TNF-α and IL-6, aiming at topical co-delivery and regulating 
multi-targets in psoriasis. These multifunctional LCNs showed appropriate 
physicochemical properties for topical application, such as a mean size of 
150 nm, low polydispersion, TP encapsulation greater than 90% and efficient 
complexation with siRNA. The internal reverse hexagonal mesostructure of LCNs 
was confirmed by SAXS while their morphology was assessed by cryo-TEM. In vitro 
permeation studies revealed an increase of more than 20-fold in the distribution 
of TP through the porcine epidermis/dermis was achieved after the application of 
LCN-TP or LCN TP in hydrogel. In cell culture, LCNs showed good compatibility 
and rapid internalization, which was attributed to macropinocytosis and 
caveolin-mediated endocytosis. Anti-inflammatory potential of multifunctional 
LCNs was assessed by reducing of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and TGF-β1 levels in 
LPS-stimulated macrophages. These results support the hypothesis that the 
co-delivery of TP and siRNAs by LCNs may be a new strategy for psoriasis topical 
therapy.

Development of a machine learning-based predictive model for prediction of 
success or failure of medical management for benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Pham K(1), Ray AW(2), Fernstrum AJ(2), Alfahmy A(2), Ray S(1), Hijaz AK(2)(3), 
Ju M(1), Sheyn D(2)(3).

OBJECTIVE: To develop a novel predictive model for identifying patients who will 
and will not respond to the medical management of benign prostatic hyperplasia 
(BPH).
METHODS: Using data from the Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) 
study, several models were constructed using an initial data set of 2172 
patients with BPH who were treated with doxazosin (Group 1), finasteride (Group 
2), and combination therapy (Group 3). K-fold stratified cross-validation was 
performed on each group, Within each group, feature selection and dimensionality 
reduction using nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) were performed based on 
the training data, before several machine learning algorithms were tested; the 
most accurate models, boosted support vector machines (SVMs), being selected for 
further refinement. The area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) was 
calculated and used to determine the optimal operating points. Patients were 
classified as treatment failures or responders, based on whether they fell below 
or above the AUC threshold for each group and for the whole data set.
RESULTS: For the entire cohort, the AUC for the boosted SVM model was 0.698. For 
patients in Group 1, the AUC was 0.729, for Group 2, the AUC was 0.719, and for 
Group 3, the AUC was 0.698.
CONCLUSION: Using MTOPS data, we were able to develop a prediction model with an 
acceptable rate of discrimination of medical management success for BPH.

An emerging class of nucleic acid-sensing regulators in bacteria: WYL 
domain-containing proteins.

Keller LM(1), Weber-Ban E(2).

Transcriptional regulation plays a central role in adaptation to changing 
environments for all living organisms. Recently, proteins belonging to a novel 
widespread class of bacterial transcription factors have been characterized in 
mycobacteria and Proteobacteria. Those multidomain proteins carry a WYL domain 
that is almost exclusive to the domain of bacteria. WYL domain-containing 
proteins act as regulators in different cellular contexts, including the DNA 
damage response and bacterial immunity. WYL domains have an Sm-like fold with 
five antiparallel β-strands arranged into a β-sandwich preceded by an α-helix. A 
common feature of WYL domains is their ability to bind nucleic acids that 
regulate their activity. In this review, we discuss recent progress made 
toward the understanding of WYL domain-containing proteins as transcriptional 
regulators, their structural features, and molecular mechanisms, as well as 
their functional roles in bacterial physiology.

The Protective Effect of Zebularine, an Inhibitor of DNA Methyltransferase, on 
Renal Tubulointerstitial Inflammation and Fibrosis.

Koh ES(1), Kim S(2), Son M(1), Park JY(2), Pyo J(2)(3), Kim WY(2), Kim M(1), 
Chung S(1), Park CW(1), Kim HS(2)(3), Shin SJ(1)(4).

Renal fibrosis, the final pathway of chronic kidney disease, is caused by 
genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Although DNA methylation has drawn attention 
as a developing mechanism of renal fibrosis, its contribution to renal fibrosis 
has not been clarified. To address this issue, the effect of zebularine, a DNA 
methyltransferase inhibitor, on renal inflammation and fibrosis in the murine 
unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) model was analyzed. Zebularine 
significantly attenuated renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis and inflammation. 
Zebularine decreased trichrome, α-smooth muscle actin, collagen IV, and 
transforming growth factor-β1 staining by 56.2%. 21.3%, 30.3%, and 29.9%, 
respectively, at 3 days, and by 54.6%, 41.9%, 45.9%, and 61.7%, respectively, at 
7 days after UUO. Zebularine downregulated mRNA expression levels of matrix 
metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, fibronectin, and Snail1 by 48.6%. 71.4%, 
31.8%, and 42.4%, respectively, at 7 days after UUO. Zebularine also suppressed 
the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and the expression of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin 
(IL)-1β, and IL-6, by 69.8%, 74.9%, and 69.6%, respectively, in obstructed 
kidneys. Furthermore, inhibiting DNA methyltransferase buttressed the nuclear 
expression of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like factor 2, which 
upregulated downstream effectors such as catalase (1.838-fold increase at 7 
days, p < 0.01), superoxide dismutase 1 (1.494-fold increase at 7 days, p < 
0.05), and NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreduate-1 (1.376-fold increase at 7 days, p < 
0.05) in obstructed kidneys. Collectively, these findings suggest that 
inhibiting DNA methylation restores the disrupted balance between 
pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory pathways to alleviate renal inflammation 
and fibrosis. Therefore, these results highlight the possibility of DNA 
methyltransferases as therapeutic targets for treating renal inflammation and 
fibrosis.

A novel interleukin-2-based fusion molecule, HCW9302, differentially promotes 
regulatory T cell expansion to treat atherosclerosis in mice.

Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by deposition of 
oxidative low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in the arterial intima which triggers 
the innate immune response through myeloid cells such as macrophages. Regulatory 
T cells (Tregs) play an important role in controlling the progression or 
regression of atherosclerosis by resolving macrophage-mediated inflammatory 
functions. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling is essential for homeostasis of Tregs. 
Since recombinant IL-2 has an unfavorable pharmacokinetic profile limiting its 
therapeutic use, we constructed a fusion protein, designated HCW9302, containing 
two IL-2 domains linked by an extracellular tissue factor domain. We found that 
HCW9302 exhibited a longer serum half-life with an approximately 1000-fold 
higher affinity for the IL-2Rα than IL-2. HCW9302 could be administered to mice 
at a dosing range that expanded and activated Tregs but not CD4+ effector T 
cells. In an ApoE-/- mouse model, HCW9302 treatment curtailed the progression of 
atherosclerosis through Treg activation and expansion, M2 macrophage 
polarization and myeloid-derived suppressor cell induction. HCW9302 treatment 
also lessened inflammatory responses in the aorta. Thus, HCW9302 is a potential 
therapeutic agent to expand and activate Tregs for treatment of inflammatory and 
autoimmune diseases.

The oxytocinase subfamily of M1 zinc aminopeptidases comprises emerging drug 
targets, including the ER-resident aminopeptidases 1 and 2 (ERAP1 and ERAP2) and 
insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP); however, reports on clinically relevant 
inhibitors are limited. Here we report a new synthetic approach of high 
diastereo- and regioselectivity for functionalization of the α-hydroxy-β-amino 
acid scaffold of bestatin. Stereochemistry and mechanism of inhibition were 
investigated by a high-resolution X-ray crystal structure of ERAP1 in complex 
with a micromolar inhibitor. By exploring the P1 side-chain functionalities, we 
achieve significant potency and selectivity, and we report a cell-active, 
low-nanomolar inhibitor of IRAP with >120-fold selectivity over homologous 
enzymes. X-ray crystallographic analysis of IRAP in complex with this inhibitor 
suggest that interactions with the GAMEN loop is an unappreciated key 
determinant for potency and selectivity. Overall, our results suggest that 
α-hydroxy-β-amino acid derivatives may constitute useful chemical tools and drug 
leads for this group of aminopeptidases.

Microenvironmental Analysis and Control for Local Cells under Confluent 
Conditions via a Capillary-Based Microfluidic Device.

Ota N(1), Tanaka N(1), Sato A(1), Shen Y(1), Yalikun Y(1)(2), Tanaka Y(1).

Sophisticated functions of biological tissues are supported by small biological 
units of cells that are localized within a region of 100 μm scale. The cells in 
these units secrete molecules to form their microenvironment to play a vital 
role in biological functions. Various microfluidic devices have been developed 
to analyze the microenvironment but were not designed for cells in a culture 
dish in a confluent condition, a typical setup for cell and tissue cultivation. 
This study presents a novel glass capillary-based microfluidic device for 
studying confluent cells in a culture dish. The multiple capillaries allow the 
device to confine the local flow in 100 μm or smaller scale to form two adjacent 
regions with different chemical properties; it can simultaneously perform local 
cell stimulation and collect secreted molecules from the stimulated cells. Cell 
removal was achieved upon trypsin stimulation from a limited area (3.8 × 10-3 ± 
1.0 × 10-3 mm2), which corresponded to 7.6 ± 2.0 cells, using the mouse skeletal 
myoblast cell line (C2C12 cells) in a confluent condition. Microenvironmental 
analysis was demonstrated by measuring the secreted tumor necrosis factor alpha 
(TNF-α) collected from the microenvironment of the stimulated and unstimulated 
mouse leukemic monocyte cell line (RAW264 cells) to track temporal changes in 
the TNF-α production. The TNF-α secreted from stimulated cells was approximately 
four-fold higher than that from unstimulated cells in 90 min. This device 
enables local cell stimulation and the collection of secreted molecules for 
cells under confluent conditions, which contributes to the analysis of the 
cellular microenvironment.

Hepatocyte-targeted delivery of imiquimod reduces hepatitis B virus surface 
antigen.

Cullis PR(3), Witzigmann D(3), Li SD(4).

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) can rapidly replicate in the hepatocytes after 
transmission, leading to chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and eventually 
hepatocellular carcinoma. Interferon-α (IFN-α) is included in the standard 
treatment for chronic hepatitis B (CHB). However, this therapy causes serious 
side effects. Delivering IFN-α selectively to the liver may enhance its efficacy 
and safety. Imiquimod (IMQ), a Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) 7 agonist, stimulates 
the release of IFN-α that exhibits potent antiviral activity. However, the poor 
solubility and tissue selectivity of IMQ limits its clinical use. Here, we 
demonstrated the use of lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) to deliver IMQ and 
increase the production of IFN-α in the liver. We encapsulated IMQ in two 
liver-targeted LNP formulations: phospholipid-free small unilamellar vesicles 
(PFSUVs) and DSPG-liposomes targeting the hepatocytes and the Kupffer cells, 
respectively. In vitro drug release/retention, in vivo pharmacokinetics, 
intrahepatic distribution, IFN-α production, and suppression of serum HBV 
surface antigen (HBsAg) were evaluated and compared for these two formulations. 
PFSUVs provided >95% encapsulation efficiency for IMQ at a drug-to-lipid ratio 
(D/L) of 1/20 (w/w) and displayed stable drug retention in the presence of 
serum. DSPG-IMQ showed 79% encapsulation of IMQ at 1/20 (D/L) and exhibited ∼30% 
burst release when incubated with serum. Within the liver, PFSUVs showed high 
selectivity for the hepatocytes while DSPG-liposomes targeted the Kupffer cells. 
Finally, in an experimental HBV mouse model, PFSUVs significantly reduced serum 
levels of HBsAg by 12-, 6.3- and 2.2-fold compared to the control, IFN-α, and 
DSPG-IMQ groups, respectively. The results suggest that the hepatocyte-targeted 
PFSUVs loaded with IMQ exhibit significant potential for enhancing therapy of 
CHB.

Multifunctionality and mechanism of processivity of family GH5 endoglucanase, 
RfGH5_4 from Ruminococcus flavefaciens on lignocellulosic polymers.

Gavande PV(1), Kumar K(1), Ahmed J(1), Goyal A(2).

Multifunctional endoglucanase, RfGH5_4 from Ruminococcus flavefaciens showed 
(β/α)8-TIM barrel structure by homology modeling. Glu168 and Glu292 residues 
acted as general acid and base during catalysis. Circular Dichroism results, 
40.83 % α-helices, 13.84 % β-strands and 45 % random turns-coils for RfGH5_4 
corroborated with predictions by PSIPRED and SOPMA. Molecular Dynamic simulation 
of RfGH5_4 for 100 ns showed RMSD, 0.71 nm while for RfGH5_4-Cellopentaose 
complex was 0.55 nm, confirming that the binding of cellulosic ligand stabilizes 
its structural fold. RfGH5_4 showed strong affinity towards cellulosic ligands 
having higher degree of polymerization such as cellohexaose (-11.70 kcal/mol) 
and cellodecaose (-12.64 kcal/mol). Interestingly, complex hemicellulosic 
ligands such as XLLG of xyloglucan also showed higher affinity (-13.2 kcal/mol) 
and accommodated at RfGH5_4 active-site. Its catalytic cleft was broad enough to 
accommodate and hydrolyse various cellulosic and hemicellulosic ligands like 
XLLG of xyloglucan setting the basis of multifunctionality of RfGH5_4. Loops L2, 
L3 and L4 having Trp58 formed barrier at active-site of RfGH5_4 were responsible 
for processivity. RfGH5_4 showed monodispersed state at 2.5 mg/mL and a 
rattle-toy shape by SAXS. Zeta potential, -16 mV of RfGH5_4 indicated its higher 
stability. Multifunctional RfGH5_4 endoglucanase could be beneficial for 
generation lignocellulosic bioethanol and in health, prebiotic and food sector.

In Silico Analysis on the Interaction of Haloacid Dehalogenase from Bacillus 
cereus IndB1 with 2-Chloroalkanoic Acid Substrates.

Ratnaningsih E(1), Saepulloh S(2).

Recently, haloacid dehalogenases have gained a lot of interest because of their 
potential applications in bioremediation and synthesis of chemical products. The 
haloacid dehalogenase gene from Bacillus cereus IndB1 (bcfd1) has been isolated, 
expressed, and Bcfd1 enzyme activity towards monochloroacetic acid has been 
successfully studied. However, the structure, enantioselectivity, substrate 
range, and essential residues of Bcfd1 have not been elucidated. This research 
performed computational studies to predict the Bcfd1 protein structure and 
analyse the interaction of Bcfd1 towards several haloacid substrates to 
comprehend their enantioselectivity and substrates' range. Structure prediction 
revealed that Bcfd1 protein consist of two domains. The main domain consists of 
seven β-sheets connected by six α-helices and four 310-helices forming a 
Rossmannoid fold. On the other hand, the cap domain consists of five β-sheets 
connected by five α-helices. The docking simulation showed that 2-chloroalkanoic 
acids bind to the active site of Bcfd1 with docking energy decreases as the 
length of their alkyl chain increases. The docking simulation also indicated 
that the docking energy differences of two enantiomers of 2-chloroalkanoic acids 
substrates were not significant. Further analysis revealed the role of Met1, 
Asp2, Cys33, and Lys204 residues in orienting the carboxylic group of 
2-chloroalkanoic acids in the active site of this enzyme through hydrogen bonds. 
This research proved that computational studies could be used to figure out the 
effect of substrates enantiomer and length of carbon skeleton to Bcfd1 affinity 
toward 2-chloroalkanoic acids.

α-synuclein misfolding and aggregation into fibrils is a common feature of 
α-synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson's disease, in which α-synuclein fibrils 
are a characteristic hallmark of neuronal inclusions called Lewy bodies. Studies 
on the composition of Lewy bodies extracted postmortem from brain tissue of 
Parkinson's patients revealed that lipids and membranous organelles are also a 
significant component. Interactions between α-synuclein and lipids have been 
previously identified as relevant for Parkinson's disease pathology, however 
molecular insights into their interactions have remained elusive. Here we 
present cryo-electron microscopy structures of six α-synuclein fibrils in 
complex with lipids, revealing specific lipid-fibril interactions. We observe 
that phospholipids promote an alternative protofilament fold, mediate an unusual 
arrangement of protofilaments, and fill the central cavities of the fibrils. 
Together with our previous studies, these structures also indicate a mechanism 
for fibril-induced lipid extraction, which is likely to be involved in the 
development of α-synucleinopathies. Specifically, one potential mechanism for 
the cellular toxicity is the disruption of intracellular vesicles mediated by 
fibrils and oligomers, and therefore the modulation of these interactions may 
provide a promising strategy for future therapeutic interventions.

Predicting milk protein fractions using infrared spectroscopy and a gradient 
boosting machine for breeding purposes in Holstein cattle.

Schiavon S(1), Tagliapietra F(1), Gallo L(1), Ajmone Marsan P(3), Cecchinato 
A(1).

In recent years, increasing attention has been focused on the genetic evaluation 
of protein fractions in cow milk with the aim of improving milk quality and 
technological characteristics. In this context, advances in high-throughput 
phenotyping by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy offer the 
opportunity for large-scale, efficient measurement of novel traits that can be 
exploited in breeding programs as indicator traits. We took milk samples from 
2,558 Holstein cows belonging to 38 herds in northern Italy, operating under 
different production systems. Fourier transform infrared spectra were collected 
on the same day as milk sampling and stored for subsequent analysis. Two sets of 
data (i.e., phenotypes and FTIR spectra) collected in 2 different years (2013 
and 2019-2020) were compiled. The following traits were assessed using HPLC: 
true protein, major casein fractions [αS1-casein (CN), αS2-CN, β-CN, κ-CN, and 
glycosylated-κ-CN], and major whey proteins (β-lactoglobulin and α-lactalbumin), 
all of which were measured both in grams per liter (g/L) and proportion of total 
nitrogen (% N). The FTIR predictions were calculated using the gradient boosting 
machine technique and tested by 3 different cross-validation (CRV) methods. We 
used the following CRV scenarios: (1) random 10-fold, which randomly split the 
whole into 10-folds of equal size (9-folds for training and 1-fold for 
validation); (2) herd/date-out CRV, which assigned 80% of herd/date as the 
training set with independence of 20% of herd/date assigned as the validation 
set; (3) forward/backward CRV, which split the data set in training and 
validation set according with the year of milk sampling (FTIR and gold standard 
data assessed in 2013 or 2019-2020) using the "old" and "new" databases for 
training and validation, and vice-versa with independence among them; (4) the 
CRV for genetic parameters (CRV-gen), where animals without pedigree as assigned 
as a fixed training population and animals with pedigree information was split 
in 5-folds, in which 1-fold was assigned to the fixed training population, and 
4-folds were assigned to the validation set (independent from the training set). 
The results (i.e., measures and predictions) of CRV-gen were used to infer the 
genetic parameters for gold standard laboratory measurements (i.e., proteins 
assessed with HPLC) and FTIR-based predictions considering the CRV-gen scenario 
from a bi-trait animal model using single-step genomic BLUP. We found that the 
prediction accuracies of the gradient boosting machine equations differed 
according to the way in which the proteins were expressed, achieving higher 
accuracy when expressed in g/L than when expressed as % N in all CRV scenarios. 
Concerning the reproducibility of the equations over the different years, the 
results showed no relevant differences in predictive ability between using "old" 
data as the training set and "new" data as the validation set and vice-versa. 
Comparing the additive genetic variance estimates for milk protein fractions 
between the FTIR predicted and HPLC measures, we found reductions of -19.7% for 
milk protein fractions expressed in g/L, and -21.19% expressed as % N. Although 
we found reductions in the heritability estimates, they were small, with values 
ranging from -1.9 to -7.25% for g/L, and -1.6 to -7.9% for % N. The posterior 
distributions of the additive genetic correlations (ra) between the FTIR 
predictions and the laboratory measurements were generally high (>0.8), even 
when the milk protein fractions were expressed as % N. Our results show the 
potential of using FTIR predictions in breeding programs as indicator traits for 
the selection of animals to enhance milk protein fraction contents. We expect 
acceptable responses to selection due to the high genetic correlations between 
HPLC measurements and FTIR predictions.

Amidoxime-derived rice husk as biocatalyst and scavenger for organophosphate 
neutralization and removal.

Ferreira JGL(1), Orth ES(2).

Organophosphates are a worldwide threat because of their presence in 
agrochemicals and chemical warfare. Situations of misuse, apprehensions of 
prohibited chemicals (e.g. pesticides), undesired stockpiles and chemical 
attacks require effective measures for neutralization and removal. Herein, a 
green approach is shown by functionalizing the agricultural waste rice husk with 
amidoximes leading to heterogeneous catalysts that were applied in the 
degradation/scavenging of toxic organophosphates. In aqueous medium, the 
waste-derived catalyst was efficient in the catalytic neutralization of a 
phosphotriester (increments up to 1 × 104-fold), while allying important 
features: selective, recyclable and lead to less toxic products. Curiously, the 
amidoximated rice husk behaved as a scavenger in the aprotic polar solvents MeCN 
and acetone by covalently bonding to the phosphoryl moiety. Upon addition of 
water, this bond is broken and the phosphoryl liberated (hydrolyzed) to the 
aqueous medium. Thus, the scavenging process is reversible and can be used to 
remove toxic organophosphates. 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was 
crucial for confirming the overall mechanisms involved. In summary, a 
sustainable material was synthetized from a waste source and employed as 
catalyst and scavenger for eliminating threatening organophosphates. This is 
promising for assuring chemical security such as in chemical emergencies.

Synthesis and structure-activity relationship of thiol-based histone deacetylase 
6 inhibitors.

G(1)(2), Li J(1)(2).

Selective histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) inhibitors are safe and well-tolerated 
with less off-target effect. However, most available HDAC6 inhibitors contain 
hydroxamate as a zinc-binding group (ZBG), and their unfavorable pharmacokinetic 
properties along with potential genotoxicity limited wide application in diverse 
diseases. Therefore, we designed and synthesized a series of selective HDAC6 
inhibitors utilizing thiol as the ZBG and discussed their structure-activity 
relationship based on molecular docking. In particular, compound 21, obtained by 
constantly step-by-step simplification and evolution based on Ricolinostat, a 
specific HDAC6 inhibitor in Phase II, unexpectedly showed high selectivity 
(29-fold) and moderate potency (73 nM). Utilizing pyrimidine as a linker in 
thiol-based HDAC6 inhibitors produces an utterly novel structure, which might 
display different pharmacokinetic properties and genotoxicity.

Impact of Tamoxifen on Vorinostat-Induced Human Immunodeficiency Virus 
Expression in Women on Antiretroviral Therapy: AIDS Clinical Trials Group A5366, 
The MOXIE Trial.

RJ(2), Gandhi RT(16).

BACKGROUND: Biological sex and the estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) modulate human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) activity. Few women have enrolled in clinical 
trials of latency reversal agents (LRAs); their effectiveness in women is 
unknown. We hypothesized that ESR1 antagonism would augment induction of HIV 
expression by the LRA vorinostat.
METHODS: AIDS Clinical Trials Group A5366 enrolled 31 virologically suppressed, 
postmenopausal women on antiretroviral therapy. Participants were randomized 2:1 
to receive tamoxifen (arm A, TAMOX/VOR) or observation (arm B, VOR) for 5 weeks 
followed by 2 doses of vorinostat. Primary end points were safety and the 
difference between arms in HIV RNA induction after vorinostat. Secondary 
analyses included histone 4 acetylation, HIV DNA, and plasma viremia by single 
copy assay (SCA).
RESULTS: No significant adverse events were attributed to study treatments. 
Tamoxifen did not enhance vorinostat-induced HIV transcription (between-arm 
ratio, 0.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], .2-2.4). Vorinostat-induced HIV 
transcription was higher in participants with increases in H4Ac (fold increase, 
2.78; 95% CI, 1.34-5.79) vs those 9 who did not (fold increase, 1.04; 95% CI, 
.25-4.29). HIV DNA and SCA plasma viremia did not substantially change.
CONCLUSIONS: Tamoxifen did not augment vorinostat-induced HIV RNA expression in 
postmenopausal women. The modest latency reversal activity of vorinostat, 
postmenopausal status, and low level of HIV RNA expression near the limits of 
quantification limited assessment of the impact of tamoxifen. This study is the 
first HIV cure trial done exclusively in women and establishes both the 
feasibility and necessity of investigating novel HIV cure strategies in women 
living with HIV.

Neuronopathic GBA1L444P Mutation Accelerates Glucosylsphingosine Levels and 
Formation of Hippocampal Alpha-Synuclein Inclusions.

NG(2), Smith SM(2), Marcus JN(2), Volpicelli-Daley LA(3).

The most common genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD) is heterozygous 
mutations GBA1, which encodes for the lysosomal enzyme, glucocerebrosidase. 
Reduced glucocerebrosidase activity associates with an accumulation of abnormal 
α-synuclein (α-syn) called Lewy pathology, which characterizes PD. PD patients 
heterozygous for the neuronotypic GBA1L444P mutation (GBA1+/L444P) have a 
5.6-fold increased risk of cognitive impairments. In this study, we used 
GBA1+/L444P mice of either sex to determine its effects on lipid metabolism, 
expression of synaptic proteins, behavior, and α-syn inclusion formation. At 3 
months of age, GBA1+/L444P mice demonstrated impaired contextual fear 
conditioning, and increased motor activity. Hippocampal levels of vGLUT1 were 
selectively reduced in GBA1+/L444P mice. We show, using mass spectrometry, that 
GBA1L444P expression increased levels of glucosylsphingosine, but not 
glucosylceramide, in the brains and serum of GBA1+/L444P mice. Templated 
induction of α-syn pathology in mice showed an increase in α-syn inclusion 
formation in the hippocampus of GBA1+/L444P mice compared with GBA1+/+ mice, but 
not in the cortex, or substantia nigra pars compacta. Pathologic α-syn reduced 
SNc dopamine neurons by 50% in both GBA1+/+ and GBA1+/L444P mice. Treatment with 
a GlcCer synthase inhibitor did not affect abundance of α-syn inclusions in the 
hippocampus or rescue dopamine neuron loss. Overall, these data suggest the 
importance of evaluating the contribution of elevated glucosylsphingosine to PD 
phenotypes. Further, our data suggest that expression of neuronotypic GBA1L444P 
may cause defects in the hippocampus, which may be a mechanism by which 
cognitive decline is more prevalent in individuals with GBA1-PD.SIGNIFICANCE 
STATEMENT Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are both 
pathologically characterized by abnormal α-synuclein (α-syn). Mutant GBA1 is a 
risk factor for both PD and DLB. Our data show the expression of neuronotypic 
GBA1L444P impairs behaviors related to hippocampal function, reduces expression 
of a hippocampal excitatory synaptic protein, and that the hippocampus is more 
susceptible to α-syn inclusion formation. Further, our data strengthen support 
for the importance of evaluating the contribution of glucosylsphingosine to PD 
phenotypes. These outcomes suggest potential mechanisms by which GBA1L444P 
contributes to the cognitive symptoms clinically observed in PD and DLB. Our 
findings also highlight the importance of glucosylsphingosine as a relevant 
biomarker for future therapeutics.

Peptide Self-Assemblies from Unusual α-Sheet Conformations Based on Alternation 
of d/l Amino Acids.

Peptide self-assembly is a hierarchical process during which secondary 
structures formed in the initial stages play a critical role in determining the 
subsequent assembling processes and final structural ordering. Unusual secondary 
structures hold promise as a source to develop novel supramolecular 
architectures with unique properties. In this work, we report the design of a 
new peptide self-assembly strategy based on unusual α-sheet secondary 
structures. In light of the strong propensity of leucine toward forming helical 
conformations and its high hydrophobicity, we design two short amphiphilic 
peptides Ac-LDLLDLK-NH2 and Ac-DLLDLLDK-NH2 with alternating l- and d-form amino 
acids. Microscopic imaging, neutron scattering, and spectroscopic measurements 
indicate that the two heterochiral peptides form highly ordered wide nanotubes 
and helical ribbons with monolayer thickness, in sharp contrast to twisted 
nanofibrils formed by the homochiral peptide Ac-LLLLK-NH2. Molecular dynamics 
simulations from monomers to trimers reveal that the two heteropeptides fold 
into α-sheets instead of β-sheets, which readily pack into tubular architectures 
in oligomer simulations. Simulated circular dichroism spectra based on α-sheet 
oligomers validate the proposed α-sheet secondary structures. These results form 
an important basis for the rational design of higher-order peptide assemblies 
with novel properties based on unusual α-sheet secondary structures.

Adrenoceptor sub-type involvement in Ca(2+) current stimulation by noradrenaline 
in human and rabbit atrial myocytes.

Saxena P(1), Myles RC(1), Smith GL(1), Workman AJ(2).

Atrial fibrillation (AF) from elevated adrenergic activity may involve increased 
atrial L-type Ca2+ current (ICaL) by noradrenaline (NA). However, the 
contribution of the adrenoceptor (AR) sub-types to such ICaL-increase is poorly 
understood, particularly in human. We therefore investigated effects of various 
broad-action and sub-type-specific α- and β-AR antagonists on NA-stimulated 
atrial ICaL. ICaL was recorded by whole-cell-patch clamp at 37 °C in myocytes 
isolated enzymatically from atrial tissues from consenting patients undergoing 
elective cardiac surgery and from rabbits. NA markedly increased human atrial 
ICaL, maximally by ~ 2.5-fold, with EC75 310 nM. Propranolol (β1 + β2-AR 
antagonist, 0.2 microM) substantially decreased NA (310 nM)-stimulated ICaL, in 
human and rabbit. Phentolamine (α1 + α2-AR antagonist, 1 microM) also decreased 
NA-stimulated ICaL. CGP20712A (β1-AR antagonist, 0.3 microM) and prazosin (α1-AR 
antagonist, 0.5 microM) each decreased NA-stimulated ICaL in both species. 
ICI118551 (β2-AR antagonist, 0.1 microM), in the presence of NA + CGP20712A, had 
no significant effect on ICaL in human atrial myocytes, but increased it in 
rabbit. Yohimbine (α2-AR antagonist, 10 microM), with NA + prazosin, had no 
significant effect on human or rabbit ICaL. Stimulation of atrial ICaL by NA is 
mediated, based on AR sub-type antagonist responses, mainly by activating β1- 
and α1-ARs in both human and rabbit, with a β2-inhibitory contribution evident 
in rabbit, and negligible α2 involvement in either species. This improved 
understanding of AR sub-type contributions to noradrenergic activation of atrial 
ICaL could help inform future potential optimisation of pharmacological 
AR-antagonism strategies for inhibiting adrenergic AF.

With the aid of the newly developed 'Sunway' heterogeneous-architecture 
supercomputer, which has world-leading HPC (high-performance computer) 
capability, a series of high-resolution coupled Earth system models (SW-HRESMs) 
with up to 5 km of atmosphere and 3 km of ocean have been developed. These 
models can meet the needs of multiscale interaction studies with different 
computational costs. Here we describe the progress of SW-HRESMs development, 
with an overview of the major advancements made by the international Earth 
science community in HR-ESMs. We also show the preliminary results of SW-HRESMs 
with regard to capturing major weather-climate extremes in the atmosphere and 
ocean, stressing the importance of permitted clouds and ocean submesoscale 
eddies in modeling tropical cyclones and eddy-mean flow interactions, and paving 
the way for further model development to resolve finer scales with even higher 
resolution and more realistic physics. Finally, in addition to increasing model 
resolution, the development procedure for a non-hydrostatic cloud and ocean 
submesoscale resolved ESM is discussed, laying out the major scientific 
directions of such a huge modeling advancement.

Urinary metabolomics to develop predictors for pediatric acute kidney injury.

Franiek A(1), Sharma A(2), Cockovski V(3), Wishart DS(4), Zappitelli M(5), 
Blydt-Hansen TD(6).

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is characterized by an abrupt decline in 
glomerular filtration rate (GFR). We sought to identify separate early urinary 
metabolomic signatures at AKI onset (with-AKI) and prior to onset of functional 
impairment (pre-AKI).
METHODS: Pre-AKI (n=15), AKI (n=22), and respective controls (n=30) from two 
prospective PICU cohort studies provided urine samples which were analyzed by 
GC-MS and DI-MS mass spectrometry (193 metabolites). The cohort (n=58) was 
8.7±6.4 years old and 66% male. AKI patients had longer PICU stays, higher PRISM 
scores, vasopressors requirement, and respiratory diagnosis and less commonly 
had trauma or post-operative diagnosis. Urine was collected within 2-3 days 
after admission and daily until day 5 or 14.
RESULTS: The metabolite classifiers for pre-AKI samples (1.5±1.1 days prior to 
AKI onset) had a cross-validated area under receiver operator curve (AUC)=0.93 
(95%CI 0.85-1.0); with-AKI samples had an AUC=0.94 (95%CI 0.87-1.0). A 
parsimonious pre-AKI classifier with 13 metabolites was similarly robust 
(AUC=0.96, 95%CI 0.89-1.0). Both classifiers were similar and showed modest 
correlation of high-ranking metabolites (tau=0.47, p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory study demonstrates the potential of a urine 
metabolite classifier to detect AKI-risk in pediatric populations earlier than 
the current standard of diagnosis with the need for external validation. A 
higher resolution version of the Graphical abstract is available as 
Supplementary information with inner reference to ESM for GA.

Oral lymphatic delivery of alpha-galactosylceramide and ovalbumin evokes 
anti-cancer immunization.

Pandey P(1), Kim SH(2), Subedi L(1), Mujahid K(2), Kim Y(2), Cho YC(2), Shim 
JH(3), Kim KT(3), Cho SS(3), Choi JU(4), Park JW(5).

We developed an orally delivered nanoemulsion that induces cancer immunization. 
It consists of tumor antigen-loaded nano-vesicles carrying the potent invariant 
natural killer T-cell (iNKT) activator α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer), to 
trigger cancer immunity by effectively activating both innate and adaptive 
immunity. It was validated that adding bile salts to the system boosted 
intestinal lymphatic transport as well as the oral bioavailability of ovalbumin 
(OVA) via the chylomicron pathway. To increase intestinal permeability further 
and amplify the antitumor responses, an ionic complex of cationic lipid 
1,2-dioleyl-3-trimethylammonium propane (DTP) with sodium deoxycholate (DA) 
(DDP) and α-GalCer were anchored onto the outer oil layer to form OVA-NE#3. As 
expected, OVA-NE#3 exhibited tremendously improved intestinal cell permeability 
as well as enhanced delivery to mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs). Subsequent 
activation of dendritic cells and iNKTs, in MLNs were also observed. Tumor 
growth in OVA-expressing mice with melanoma was more strongly suppressed (by 
71%) after oral administration of OVA-NE#3 than in untreated controls, 
confirming the strong immune response induced by the system. The serum levels of 
OVA-specific IgG1 and IgG2a were 3.52- and 6.14-fold higher than in controls. 
Treating OVA-NE#3 increased the numbers of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, 
including cytotoxic T-cell and M1-like macrophage. Antigen- and 
α-GalCer-associated enrichment of dendritic cells and iNKTs in tumor tissues 
also increased after OVA-NE#3 treatment. These observations indicate that our 
system induces both cellular and humoral immunity by targeting the oral 
lymphatic system. It may offer a promising oral anti-cancer vaccination strategy 
that involves the induction of systemic anti-cancer immunization.

In Vitro Gene Expression Responses of Bovine Rumen Epithelial Cells to Different 
pH Stresses.

Lian H(1)(2), Zhang C(1)(2), Liu Y(1)(2), Li W(1)(2), Fu T(1)(2), Gao T(1)(2), 
Zhang L(1)(2).

Ruminal acidosis often occurs in production, which greatly affects animal health 
and production efficiency. Subacute rumen acidosis (SARA) occurs when rumen pH 
drops rapidly to 5.5−5.8, and acute rumen acidosis (ARA) occurs when rumen pH 
drops below 5.0, but the molecular regulation mechanism of the rumen epithelium 
after the rapid decrease in pH is still unclear. Bovine rumen epithelial cells 
(BRECs) were cultured at pH = 7.4 (control), 5.5 (SARA), and 4.5 (ARA). 
Transcriptome and metabolomic methods were used to obtain the molecular-based 
response of BRECs to different pH treatments; pH = 4.5 can significantly induce 
apoptosis of BRECs. The RNA-seq experiments revealed 1381 differently expressed 
genes (DEGs) in the control vs. SARA groups (p < 0.05). Fibroblast growth factor 
(FGF) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) were upregulated 4.25 and 6.86 fold, 
respectively, and TLR4 was downregulated 0.58 fold. In addition, 283 DEGs were 
identified in the control vs. ARA comparison (p < 0.05), and 
prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PSTG2) was downregulated 0.54 fold. Our 
research reveals that the MAPK/TNF signaling pathway regulates the inflammatory 
response of BRECs. Metabolomics identified 35 biochemical compounds that were 
significantly affected (p < 0.05) in control vs. SARA and 51 in control vs. ARA. 
Bioinformatics analysis using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) 
pathway database revealed that drug metabolism-cytochrome P450 metabolic and 
alpha-linolenic acid metabolism changes occurred. These transcriptional and 
metabolic changes are related to the adaptation of BRECs to low-pH stresses. In 
conclusion, the combined data analyses presented a worthy strategy to 
characterize the cellular, transcriptomic, and metabonomic adaptation of BRECs 
to pH in vitro. We demonstrated transcriptional expression changes in BRECs 
under pH stress and activation of the molecular mechanisms controlling 
inflammation.

Carbon monoxide exposure activates ULK1 via AMPK phosphorylation in murine 
embryonic fibroblasts.

Stucki D(1), Westhoff P(2), Brilhaus D(2), Weber APM(3), Brenneisen P(1), Stahl 
W(1).

Carbon monoxide (CO) is endogenously produced upon degradation of heme by heme 
oxygenases (HOs) and is suggested to act as a gaseous signaling molecule. The 
expression of HO-1 is triggered by the Nrf2-Keap1 signaling pathway which 
responds to exogenous stress signals and dietary constituents such as flavonoids 
and glucosinolates or reactive metabolic intermediates like 4-hydroxynonenal. 
Endogenous CO affects energy metabolism, regulates the utilization of glucose 
and addresses CYP450 enzymes. Using the CO releasing molecule-401 (CORM-401), we 
studied the effect of endogenous CO on ATP synthesis, AMP-signaling and 
activation of the AMPK pathway in cell culture. Upon exposure of cells to 
CORM-401, the mitochondrial ATP production rate was significantly decreased 
(P=0.007) to about 50%, while glycolytic ATP synthesis was unchanged (P=0.489). 
Total ATP levels were less affected as determined by mass spectrometry. Instead, 
levels of ADP and AMP were elevated following CORM-401 exposure by about two- 
(P=0.022) and four-fold (P=0.012) compared to control, respectively. Increased 
concentrations of AMP activate AMPK which was demonstrated by a 10 to 15-fold 
increased phosphorylation of Thr172 of the α-subunit of AMPK (P=0.025). A 
downstream target of AMPK is the kinase ULK1 which triggers autophagic and 
mitophagic processes. Activation of ULK1 after CO exposure was proven by a 3 to 
5-fold elevated phosphorylation of ULK1 at Ser555 (P=0.004). The present data 
suggest that production of endogenous CO leads to increasing amounts of AMP 
which mediates AMPK-dependent downstream effects and likely triggers autophagic 
processes. Since dietary constituents and their metabolites induce the 
expression of the CO producing enzyme HO-1, CO signaling may also be involved in 
the cellular response to nutritional factors.

Pharmacoinformatic Investigation of Silymarin as a Potential Inhibitor against 
Nemopilema nomurai Jellyfish Metalloproteinase Toxin-like Protein.

Asirvatham RD(1), Hwang DH(1)(2), Prakash RLM(1), Kang C(1)(2), Kim E(1)(2).

Jellyfish stings pose a major threat to swimmers and fishermen worldwide. These 
creatures have explosive cells containing one large secretory organelle called a 
nematocyst in their tentacles, which contains venom used to immobilize prey. 
Nemopilema nomurai, a venomous jellyfish belonging to the phylum Cnidaria, 
produces venom (NnV) comprising various toxins known for their lethal effects on 
many organisms. Of these toxins, metalloproteinases (which belong to the toxic 
protease family) play a significant role in local symptoms such as dermatitis 
and anaphylaxis, as well as systemic reactions such as blood coagulation, 
disseminated intravascular coagulation, tissue injury, and hemorrhage. Hence, a 
potential metalloproteinase inhibitor (MPI) could be a promising candidate for 
reducing the effects of venom toxicity. For this study, we retrieved the 
Nemopilema nomurai venom metalloproteinase sequence (NnV-MPs) from transcriptome 
data and modeled its three-dimensional structure using AlphaFold2 in a Google 
Colab notebook. We employed a pharmacoinformatics approach to screen 39 
flavonoids and identify the most potent inhibitor against NnV-MP. Previous 
studies have demonstrated the efficacy of flavonoids against other animal 
venoms. Based on our analysis, Silymarin emerged as the top inhibitor through 
ADMET, docking, and molecular dynamics analyses. In silico simulations provide 
detailed information on the toxin and ligand binding affinity. Our results 
demonstrate that Silymarin's strong inhibitory effect on NnV-MP is driven by 
hydrophobic affinity and optimal hydrogen bonding. These findings suggest that 
Silymarin could serve as an effective inhibitor of NnV-MP, potentially reducing 
the toxicity associated with jellyfish envenomation.

Influence of Tobacco Variety and Curing on Free Radical Production in Cigarette 
Smoke.

Bitzer ZT(1), Mocniak LE(1), Trushin N(1), Smith M(1), Richie JP(1).

INTRODUCTION: Cigarette smoke contains highly reactive free radicals thought to 
play an important role in tobacco smoke-induced harm. Previously, large 
variations in free radical and toxicant output have been observed in commercial 
cigarettes. These variations are likely because of cigarette design features 
(paper, filter, and additives), tobacco variety (burley, bright, oriental, 
etc.), and tobacco curing methods (air, sun, flue, and fire). Previous reports 
show that tobacco varieties and curing methods influence the production of 
tobacco smoke constituents like the tobacco-specific carcinogen nicotine-derived 
nitrosamine ketone (NNK).
AIMS AND METHODS: We evaluated free radical, nicotine, and NNK production in 
cigarette smoke from cigarettes produced with 15 different types of tobacco. 
Gas-phase free radicals were captured by spin trapping with 
N-tert-butyl-α-phenylnitrone and particulate-phase radicals were captured on a 
Cambridge Filter pad (CFP). Both types of radicals were analyzed using electron 
paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Nicotine and NNK were extracted from the 
CFP and analyzed by gas chromatography flame ionization detection and liquid 
chromatography-mass spectrometry, respectively.
RESULTS: Gas-phase radicals varied nearly 8-fold among tobacco types with Saint 
James Perique tobacco producing the highest levels (42 ± 7 nmol/g) and Canadian 
Virginia tobacco-producing the lowest levels (5 ± 2 nmol/g). Nicotine and NNK 
levels in smoke varied 14-fold and 192-fold, respectively, by type. Gas-phase 
free radicals were highly correlated with NNK levels (r = 0.92, p < .0001) and 
appeared to be most impacted by tobacco curing method.
CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, these data suggest that tobacco types used in cigarette 
production may serve as a target for regulation to reduce harm from cigarette 
smoking.
IMPLICATIONS: Variations in cigarette free radical and NNK levels vary based on 
the tobacco variety and curing method. Reducing the ratio of high-producing free 
radical and NNK tobacco types offer a potential tool for regulators and 
producers looking to reduce toxicant output from cigarettes.

Structural insight into the activation of an Arabidopsis organellar C-to-U RNA 
editing enzyme by active site complementation.

Toma-Fukai S(1), Sawada Y(1), Maeda A(2), Shimizu H(1), Shikanai T(2), Takenaka 
M(2), Shimizu T(1).

RNA-binding pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins catalyze hundreds of 
cytidine to uridine RNA editing events in plant organelles; these editing events 
are essential for proper gene expression. More than half of the PPR-type RNA 
editing factors, however, lack the DYW cytidine deaminase domain. Genetic 
analyses have suggested that their cytidine deaminase activity arises by 
association with a family of DYW1-like proteins that contain an N-terminally 
truncated DYW domain, but their molecular mechanism has been unclear. Here, we 
report the crystal structure of the Arabidopsis thaliana DYW1 deaminase domain 
at 1.8 Å resolution. DYW1 has a cytidine deaminase fold lacking the PG box. The 
internal insertion within the deaminase fold shows an α-helical fold instead of 
the β-finger reported for the gating domain of the A. thaliana ORGANELLE 
TRANSCRIPT PROCESSING 86. The substrate-binding pocket is incompletely formed 
and appears to be complemented in the complex by the E2 domain and the PG box of 
the interacting PPR protein. In vivo RNA editing assays corroborate the 
activation model for DYW1 deaminase. Our study demonstrates the common 
activation mechanism of the DYW1-like proteins by molecular complementation of 
the DYW domain and reconstitution of the substrate-binding pocket.

Analogy or fallacy, unsafe chemical alternatives: Mechanistic insights into 
energy metabolism dysfunction induced by Bisphenol analogs in HepG2 cells.

Jia S(1), Marques Dos Santos M(1), Li C(1), Fang M(2), Sureshkumar M(1), Snyder 
SA(3).

Bisphenol analogs (BPs) are widely used as industrial alternatives for Bisphenol 
A (BPA). Their toxicity assessment in humans has mainly focused on estrogenic 
activity, while other toxicity effects and mechanisms resulting from BPs 
exposure remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of three BPs 
(Bisphenol AF (BPAF), Bisphenol G (BPG) and Bisphenol PH (BPPH)) on metabolic 
pathways of HepG2 cells. Results from comprehensive cellular bioenergetics 
analysis and nontarget metabolomics indicated that the most important process 
affected by BPs exposure was energy metabolism, as evidenced by reduced 
mitochondrial function and enhanced glycolysis. Compared to the control group, 
BPG and BPPH exhibited a consistent pattern of metabolic dysregulation, while 
BPAF differed from both, such as an increased ATP: ADP ratio (1.29-fold, 
p < 0.05) observed in BPAF and significantly decreased ATP: ADP ratio for BPG 
(0.28-fold, p < 0.001) and BPPH (0.45-fold, p < 0.001). Bioassay endpoint 
analysis revealed BPG/BPPH induced alterations in mitochondrial membrane 
potential and overproductions of reactive oxygen species. Taken together these 
data suggested that BPG/BPPH induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage 
in cells results in energy metabolism dysregulation. By contrast, BPAF had no 
effect on mitochondrial health, but induced a proliferation promoting effect on 
cells, which might contribute to the energy metabolism dysfunction. 
Interestingly, BPPH induced the greatest mitochondrial damage among the three 
BPs but did not exhibit Estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) activating effects. This 
study characterized the distinct metabolic mechanisms underlying energy 
metabolism dysregulation induced by different BPs in target human cells, 
providing new insight into the evaluation of the emerging BPA substitutes.

This study aimed to enhance the water solubility and antioxidant properties of 
mangiferin by transglucosylation using cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (CGTase) 
from Thermoanaerobacter sp. The highest mangiferin to mangiferin glucoside 
conversion yield achieved was 88.9% using 60 mU/mL CGTase, 25 mM mangiferin, and 
10% starch (w/v), with incubation at 60 °C for 10 h. The product of 
transglucosylation was purified and its chemical structure was determined to be 
glucosyl-α-(1→4)-mangiferin (MGF-g1) using matrix-assisted laser desorption 
ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance 
spectroscopy. The water solubility of MGF-g1 was 5,093 times higher than that of 
mangiferin. MGF-g1 exhibited 1.6-fold higher 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 
radical scavenging activity, 1.24-fold higher oxygen radical antioxidant 
capacity, and 1.19-fold higher ferric reducing ability power, compared to 
mangiferin. Moreover, the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitory activity (IC50) of 
mangiferin and MGF-g1 were 76.44 ± 11.7 μM and 59.74 ± 2.8 μM, respectively. Our 
results suggest that the novel MGF-g1 has potential applications as a functional 
material in the food and pharmaceutical industries.

Engineering the Staple Oil Crop Brassica napus Enriched with α-Linolenic Acid 
Using the Perilla FAD2-FAD3 Fusion Gene.

R(1)(2), Gao H(1)(2), Fan TT(1)(2), Chai YR(1)(2).

Modern people generally suffer from α-linolenic acid (ALA) deficiency, since 
most staple food oils are low in ALA content. Thus, the enhancement of ALA in 
staple oil crops is of importance. In this study, the FAD2 and FAD3 coding 
regions from the ALA-king species Perilla frutescens were fused using a newly 
designed double linker LP4-2A, driven by a seed-specific promoter PNAP, and 
engineered into a rapeseed elite cultivar ZS10 with canola quality background. 
The mean ALA content in the seed oil of PNAP:PfFAD2-PfFAD3 (N23) T5 lines was 
3.34-fold that of the control (32.08 vs 9.59%), with the best line being up to 
37.47%. There are no significant side effects of the engineered constructs on 
the background traits including oil content. In fatty acid biosynthesis 
pathways, the expression levels of structural genes as well as regulatory genes 
were significantly upregulated in N23 lines. On the other hand, the expression 
levels of genes encoding the positive regulators of flavonoid-proanthocyanidin 
biosynthesis but negative regulators of oil accumulation were significantly 
downregulated. Surprisingly, the ALA level in PfFAD2-PfFAD3 transgenic rapeseed 
lines driven by the constitutive promoter PD35S was not increased or even showed 
a slight decrease due to the lower level of foreign gene expression and 
downregulation of the endogenous orthologous genes BnFAD2 and BnFAD3.

Cyanidin-3-galactoside from Aronia melanocarpa ameliorates silica-induced 
pulmonary fibrosis by modulating the TGF-β/mTOR and NRF2/HO-1 pathways.

Cui Y(1), Zhao J(1), Chen J(1), Kong Y(1), Wang M(1), Ma Y(2), Meng X(1).

Cyanidin-3-galactoside (C3G), the most abundant anthocyanin in Aronia 
melanocarpa, has many beneficial health effects, such as antioxidation. C3G was 
extracted from A. melanocarpa and applied (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg body weight) 
to 50-μl silica particles (SP) solution-exposed mice to research its 
antifibrotic properties using histological analysis, hydroxyproline assay, 
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and western blot analysis. The 
results showed that C3G treatment significantly ameliorated pulmonary fibrosis 
and cell infiltration into the lungs of mice. It also relieved SP-induced 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), 400 mg/kg C3G treatment increasing 
epithelial-cadherin mRNA expression and decreasing α-smooth muscle actin mRNA 
expression to the level of that in the control group. Western blot analysis 
showed that exposure to SP increased the production of transforming growth 
factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) by 
4.71- and 4.15-fold, respectively, in the lungs of mice, which were 
significantly inhibited by C3G treatment. Moreover, 400 mg/kg C3G treatment 
up-regulated two important antioxidant mediators, nuclear factor 
erythroid-2-related factor 2 (NRF2; 4.91-fold) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1; 
4.81-fold). The mechanism study indicated that C3G might inhibit the TGF-β/mTOR 
signaling via the NRF2/HO-1 pathway and that SP-induced pulmonary EMT was 
ameliorated by inhibiting the TGF-β/mTOR signaling pathway. Our findings could 
provide new avenues for C3G as a functional food for preventing or mediating the 
progression of SP-induced pulmonary fibrosis.

Enhancing lactose recognition of a key enzyme in 2'-fucosyllactose synthesis: 
α-1,2-fucosyltransferase.

H(1)(4), Chen Z(1)(4), Wang Y(1)(4), Zhou H(1)(4).

BACKGROUND: 2'-Fucosyllactose, a representative oligosaccharide in human milk, 
is an emerging and promising food and pharmaceutical ingredient due to its 
powerful health benefits, such as participating in immune regulation, regulation 
of intestinal flora, etc. To enable economically viable production of 
2'-fucosyllactose, different biosynthesis strategies using precursors and 
pathway enzymes have been developed. The α-1,2-fucosyltransferases are an 
essential part involved in these strategies, but their strict substrate 
selectivity and unsatisfactory substrate tolerance are one of the key roadblocks 
limiting biosynthesis.
RESULTS: To tackle this issue, a semi-rational manipulation combining 
computer-aided designing and screening with biochemical experiments were 
adopted. The mutant had a 100-fold increase in catalytic efficiency compared to 
the wild-type. The highest 2'-fucosyllactose yield was up to 0.65 mol mol-1 
lactose with a productivity of 2.56 g mL-1  h-1 performed by enzymatic catalysis 
in vitro. Further analysis revealed that the interactions between the mutant and 
substrates were reduced. The crucial contributions of wild-type and mutant to 
substrate recognition ability were closely related to their distinct phylotypes 
in terms of amino acid preference.
CONCLUSION: It is envisioned that the engineered α-1,2-fucosyltransferase could 
be harnessed to relieve constraints imposed on the bioproduction of 
2'-fucosyllactose and lay a theoretical foundation for elucidating the substrate 
recognition mechanisms of fucosyltransferases. © 2022 Society of Chemical

Feng Y(1), Dong H(2), Zheng L(3).

CONTEXT: Endometriosis (EMs) is a gynecological disorder. Ligustrazine has been 
reported to exert an anti-inflammatory effect on EMs. However, the underlying 
mechanisms are not completely understood.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of ligustrazine on the progression of EMs 
and the underlying regulatory mechanisms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human endometrial stromal cells (HESCs) were isolated 
from patients with EMs or control subjects. HESCs were treated with 25, 50, 100, 
or 200 μM ligustrazine for 1, 3, 6, or 12 h. Western blot and enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assays were performed to determine the levels of proteins and 
inflammatory cytokines, respectively. The binding between STAT3 and insulin-like 
growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) was assessed by chromatin 
immunoprecipitation and dual-luciferase reporter assays. The relationship 
between IGF2BP1 and RELA was assessed by RNA immunoprecipitation and RNA 
pull-down assay.
RESULTS: Phosphorylated STAT3, IGF2BP1, RELA, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β were 
upregulated in EMs tissues compared with control tissues (by 1.79-, 2.55-, 
1.58-, 3.01-, 2.55-, and 3.34-fold, respectively). Ligustrazine inhibited the 
expression of p-STAT3, IGF2BP1, RELA, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β. Overexpression of 
STAT3 promoted RELA-mediated inflammatory responses, while ligustrazine (100 µM) 
notably reversed this phenomenon. Ligustrazine also alleviated RELA-induced 
inflammation via downregulating IGF2BP1. STAT3 bound to the promoter of IGF2BP1, 
and IGF2BP1 bound to the RELA mRNA.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Ligustrazine inhibited inflammation in EMs via 
regulating the STAT3/IGF2BP1/RELA axis. These findings propose a new agent 
against EMs and support the development of ligustrazine-based treatment 
strategies for EMs.

Harnessing polyhydroxylated pyrrolidines as a stabilizer of acid 
alpha-glucosidase (GAA) to enhance the efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy in 
Pompe disease.

YH(2), Hwu WL(5), Cheng WC(6).

To discover small molecules as acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) stabilizers for 
potential benefits of the exogenous enzyme treatment toward Pompe disease cells, 
we started from the initial screening of the unique chemical space, consisting 
of sixteen stereoisomers of 2-aminomethyl polyhydroxylated pyrrolidines (ADMDPs) 
to find out two primary stabilizers 17 and 18. Further external or internal 
structural modifications of 17 and 18 were performed to increase structural 
diversity, followed by the protein thermal shift study to evaluate the GAA 
stabilizing ability. Fortunately, pyrrolidine 21, possessing an l-arabino-typed 
configuration pattern, was identified as a specific potent rh-GAA stabilizer, 
enabling the suppression of rh-GAA protein denaturation. In a cell-based Pompe 
model, co-administration of 21 with rh-GAA protein significantly improved 
enzymatic activity (up to 5-fold) compared to administration of enzyme alone. 
Potentially, pyrrolidine 21 enables the direct increase of ERT (enzyme 
replacement therapy) efficacy in cellulo and in vivo.

l-Threonine aldolases (LTAs) employing pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) as cofactor can 
convert low-cost achiral substrates glycine and aldehyde directly into valuable 
β-hydroxy-α-amino acids such as (2R,3S)-2-amino-3-hydroxy-3-(4-nitrophenyl) 
propanoic acid ((R,S)-AHNPA), which is utilized broadly as crucial chiral 
intermediates for bioactive compounds. However, LTAs' stereospecificity towards 
the β carbon is rather moderate and their activity and stability at high 
substrate load is low, which limits their industrial application. Here, 
computer-aided directed evolution was applied to improve overall activity, 
selectivity and stability under desired process conditions of a l-threonine 
aldolase in the asymmetric synthesis of (R,S)-AHNPA. Selectivity and stability 
determining regions were computationally identified for structure-guided 
directed evolution of LTA-variants under efficient biocatalytic process 
conditions using 40% ethanol as cosolvent. We applied molecular modeling to 
rationalize selectivity improvement and design focused libraries targeting the 
substrate binding pocket, and we also used MD simulations in nonaqueous process 
environment as an effective and promising method to predict potential unstable 
loop regions near the tetramer interface which are hot-spots for cosolvent 
resistance. An excellent LTA variant EM-ALDO031 with 18 mutations was obtained, 
which showed ∼ 30-fold stability improvement in 40% ethanol and 
diastereoselectivity (de) raised from 31.5% to 85% through a three-phase 
evolution campaign. Our fast and efficient data-driven methodology utilizing a 
combination of experimental and computational tools enabled us to evolve an 
aldolase variant to achieve the target of 90% conversion at up to 150 g/L 
substrate load in 40% ethanol, enabling the biocatalytic production of 
β-hydroxy-α-amino acids from cheap achiral precursors at multi-ton scale.

BBV152 is a whole-virion inactivated vaccine based on the Asp614Gly variant. 
BBV152 is the first alum-imidazoquinolin-adjuvanted vaccine authorized for use 
in large populations. Here we characterized the magnitude, quality and 
persistence of cellular and humoral memory responses up to 6 months post 
vaccination. We report that the magnitude of vaccine-induced spike and 
nucleoprotein antibodies was comparable with that produced after infection. 
Receptor binding domain-specific antibodies declined against variants in the 
order of Alpha (B.1.1.7; 3-fold), Delta (B.1.617.2; 7-fold) and Beta (B.1.351; 
10-fold). However, pseudovirus neutralizing antibodies declined up to 2-fold 
against the Delta followed by the Beta variant (1.7-fold). Vaccine-induced 
memory B cells were also affected by the Delta and Beta variants. The 
SARS-CoV-2-specific multicytokine-expressing CD4+ T cells were found in ~85% of 
vaccinated individuals. Only a ~1.3-fold reduction in efficacy was observed in 
CD4+ T cells against the Beta variant. We found that antigen-specific CD4+ T 
cells were present in the central memory compartment and persisted for at least 
up to 6 months post vaccination. Vaccine-induced CD8+ T cells were detected in 
~50% of individuals. Importantly, the vaccine was capable of inducing follicular 
T helper cells that exhibited B-cell help potential. These findings show that 
inactivated vaccine BBV152 induces robust immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 and 
variants of concern that persists for at least 6 months after vaccination.

Acute and Sublethal Effects of Deltamethrin Discharges from the Aquaculture 
Industry on Northern Shrimp (Pandalus borealis Krøyer, 1838): Dispersal Modeling 
and Field Investigations.

Pharmaceutical deltamethrin (Alpha Max), used as delousing treatments in 
aquaculture, has raised concerns due to possible negative impacts on the marine 
environment. A novel approach combining different scientific disciplines has 
addressed this topic. Acute (mortality) and sublethal effects (i.e., fitness, 
neurological, immunological, and oxidative responses) of exposure of northern 
shrimp (Pandalus borealis) were studied in laboratory experiments. Passive water 
sampling combined with sediment analyses revealed environmental concentrations. 
Finally, dispersal modeling was performed to predict environmental 
concentrations. Ecotoxicological analyses showed mortality in shrimp after 1 h 
of exposure to 2 ng L-1 (1000-fold dilution of treatment dose), revealing a high 
sensitivity to deltamethrin. Sublethal effects included induction of 
acetylcholinesterase and acyl CoA oxidase activities and oxidative impairment, 
which may be linked to neurotoxic responses. Field concentrations of 10-200 ng 
L-1 in water (100 m from the pens) and <LOD-0.19 ng g-1 dw in sediment (0-400 m 
from pens) were measured. Ecotoxicological values were compared with measured 
and modeled concentrations. They showed that concentrations higher than those 
causing mortality could be expected up to 4-5 km from point of release, in an 
area of 6.4 km2, with lethal concentrations remaining up to 35 h in some areas. 
Hence, the study demonstrates that there is a considerable risk for negative 
effects on the ecologically and commercially important shrimp.

Changes in Endocan and Dermatan Sulfate Are Associated with Biomechanical 
Properties of Abdominal Aortic Wall during Aneurysm Expansion and Rupture.

Reeps C(5), Maegdefessel L(1)(2), Gee M(3), Eckstein HH(1)(2), Pelisek 
J(1)(2)(4).

BACKGROUND AND AIMS:  The study aimed to assess the potential of proteoglycans 
(PGs) and collagens as serological biomarkers in the abdominal aortic aneurysm 
(AAA). Furthermore, we investigated the underlying mechano-biological 
interactions and signaling pathways.
METHODS:  Tissue and serum samples from patients with ruptured AAA (rAAA; 
n = 29), elective AAA (eAAA; n = 78), and healthy individuals (n = 8) were 
evaluated by histology, immunohistochemistry, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay, and mechanical properties were assessed by tensile tests. Regulatory 
pathways were determined by membrane-based sandwich immunoassay.
RESULTS:  In AAA samples, collagen type I and III (Col1 and Col3), chondroitin 
sulfate, and dermatan sulfate (DS) were significantly increased compared with 
controls (3.0-, 3.2-, 1.3-, and 53-fold; p < 0.01). Col1 and endocan were also 
elevated in the serum of AAA patients (3.6- and 6.0-fold; p < 0.01), while DS 
was significantly decreased (2.5-fold; p < 0.01). Histological scoring showed 
increased total PGs and focal accumulation in rAAA compared with eAAA. Tissue 
β-stiffness was higher in rAAA compared with eAAA (2.0-fold, p = 0.02). Serum 
Col1 correlated with maximum tensile force and failure tension (r = 0.448 and 
0.333; p < 0.01, and r = 0.02), tissue endocan correlated with α-stiffness 
(r = 0.340; p < 0.01). Signaling pathways in AAA were associated with 
extracellular matrix synthesis and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. In 
particular, Src family kinases and platelet-derived growth factor- and epidermal 
growth factor-related proteins seem to be involved.
CONCLUSION:  Our findings reveal a structural association between collagen and 
PGs and their response to changes in mechanical loads in AAA. Particularly Col1 
and endocan reflect the mechano-biological conditions of the aortic wall also in 
the patient's serum and might serve for AAA risk stratification.

Design and synthesis of mogrol derivatives modified on a ring with 
anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative activities.

Song JR(1), Li N(2), Wei YL(3), Lu FL(3), Li DP(4).

A class of novel mogrol derivatives modified on A ring were synthesized. The 
screening result showed that indole-fused derivatives exhibited lower toxicity 
and better anti-inflammatory activity in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells model than 
mogrol and other compounds. Derivative B8 exerted superior inhibitory result of 
NO production (IC50 = 5.05 μM) and inhibitory ability of TNF-α and IL-6 
secretion to mogrol through iNOS/NF-κB pathway. Besides, the CCK8 assay was 
performed to evaluate their anti-proliferative activity against non-small cell 
lung cancer including A549, NCI-H460, H1299 and H1975 cells. Compared with 
mogrol, compound B8 showed moderate anti-proliferative activities against A549 
and H1975 cells, while derivatives bearing α, β-unsaturated ketone scaffold 
displayed broad-spectrum growth inhibition against four cell lines. Among them, 
compound A9 showed 12-fold higher activity than mogrol against H1299 and H1975 
cells. The suppressive effect on expression level of p-p65 might account for the 
compound A9-induced growth inhibition and cell cycle arrest at G1 phase.

Secreted proteins mediate essential physiological processes. With conventional 
assays, it is challenging to map the spatial distribution of proteins secreted 
by single cells, to study cell-to-cell heterogeneity in secretion, or to detect 
proteins of low abundance or incipient secretion. Here, we introduce the 
"FluoroDOT assay," which uses an ultrabright nanoparticle plasmonic-fluor that 
enables high-resolution imaging of protein secretion. We find that 
plasmonic-fluors are 16,000-fold brighter, with nearly 30-fold higher 
signal-to-noise compared with conventional fluorescence labels. We demonstrate 
high-resolution imaging of different secreted cytokines in the single-plexed and 
spectrally multiplexed FluoroDOT assay that revealed cellular heterogeneity in 
secretion of multiple proteins simultaneously. Using diverse biochemical 
stimuli, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, and a variety of immune 
cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), and DC-T cell co-culture, we 
demonstrate that the assay is versatile, facile, and widely adaptable for 
enhancing biological understanding of spatial and temporal dynamics of 
single-cell secretome.

Schinus terebinthifolius Leaf Lectin (SteLL) Reduces the Bacterial and 
Inflammatory Burden of Wounds Infected by Staphylococcus aureus Promoting Skin 
Repair.

Staphylococcus aureus is commonly found in wound infections where this pathogen 
impairs skin repair. The lectin isolated from leaves of Schinus terebinthifolius 
(named SteLL) has antimicrobial and antivirulence action against S. aureus. This 
study evaluated the effects of topical administration of SteLL on mice wounds 
infected by S. aureus. Seventy-two C57/BL6 mice (6−8 weeks old) were allocated 
into four groups: (i) uninfected wounds; (ii) infected wounds, (iii) infected 
wounds treated with 32 µg/mL SteLL solution; (iv) infected wounds treated with 
64 µg/mL SteLL solution. The excisional wounds (64 mm2) were induced on the 
dorsum and infected by S. aureus 432170 (4.0 × 106 CFU/wound). The daily 
treatment started 1-day post-infection (dpi). The topical application of both 
SteLL concentrations significantly accelerated the healing of S. aureus-infected 
wounds until the 7th dpi, when compared to untreated infected lesions 
(reductions of 1.95−4.55-fold and 1.79−2.90-fold for SteLL at 32 µg/mL and 64 
µg/mL, respectively). The SteLL-based treatment also amended the severity of 
wound infection and reduced the bacterial load (12-fold to 72-fold for 32 µg/mL, 
and 14-fold to 282-fold for 64 µg/mL). SteLL-treated wounds show higher collagen 
deposition and restoration of skin structure than other groups. The bacterial 
load and the levels of inflammatory markers (IL-6, MCP-1, TNF-α, and VEGF) were 
also reduced by both SteLL concentrations. These results corroborate the 
reported anti-infective properties of SteLL, making this lectin a lead candidate 
for developing alternative agents for the treatment of S. aureus-infected skin 
lesions.

The aim of this study was to determine the oxidative/antioxidative effects, 
modulatory and selective potential of α-tocopherol (vitamin E) on antineoplastic 
drug-induced toxicogenetic damage. The toxicity, cytotoxicity and genotoxicity 
induced by antineoplastic agents cyclophosphamide (CPA) and doxorubicin (DOX) 
was examined utilizing as models Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Allium cepa, Artemia 
salina and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in the presence of 
α-tocopherol. For these tests, concentrations of α- tocopherol 100 IU/ml 
(67mg/ml), CPA 20 µg/ml, DOX 2 µg/ml were used. The selectivity of α-tocopherol 
was assessed by the MTT test using human mammary gland non-tumor (MCF10A) and 
tumor (MCF-7) cell lines. Data showed cytoplasmic and mitochondrial oxidative 
damage induced by CPA or DOX was significantly diminished by α-tocopherol in S. 
cerevisiae. In addition, the toxic effects on A. salina and cytotoxic and 
mutagenic effects on A. cepa were significantly reduced by α-tocopherol. In 
PBMCs, α-tocopherol alone did not markedly affect these cells, and when treated 
in conjunction with CPA or DOX, α-tocopherol reduced the toxicogenetic effects 
noted after antineoplastic drug administration as evidenced by decreased 
chromosomal alterations and lowered cell death rate. In human mammary gland 
non-tumor and tumor cell lines, α-tocopherol produced selective cytotoxicity 
with 2-fold higher effect in tumor cells. Evidence indicates that vitamin E (1) 
produced anti-cytotoxic and anti-mutagenic effects against CPA and DOX (2) 
increased higher selectivity toward tumor cells, and (3) presented 
chemoprotective activity in PBMCs.

Changes in Health-Promoting Behaviors and Their Association with Weight Loss, 
Retention, and Engagement on a Digital Program: Prospective Study.

Behr H(1), Earl S(2), Ho AS(3), Lee J(4), Mitchell ES(3), McCallum M(3), May 
CN(3), Michaelides A(3).

Health-promoting lifestyle behaviors (e.g., as measured by the HPLP-II) are 
associated with reductions in lifestyle disease mortality, as well as improved 
well-being, mental health, and quality of life. However, it is unclear how a 
weight-management program relates to a broad range of these behaviors (i.e., 
health responsibility, physical activity, nutrition, spiritual growth, 
interpersonal relations, and stress management), especially a fully digital 
program on which individuals have to self-manage their own behaviors in their 
daily lives (with assistance from a virtual human coach). In the context of a 
digital setting, this study examined the changes in health-promoting behaviors 
over 12 months, as well as the associations between health-promoting behaviors 
and weight loss, retention, and engagement, among participants who self-enrolled 
in a mobile CBT-based nutritionally focused behavior change weight management 
program (n = 242). Participants lost a statistically significant amount of 
weight (M = 6.7 kg; SD = 12.7 kg; t(80) = 9.26, p < 0.001) and reported 
significantly improved overall health-promoting lifestyle behaviors (i.e., 
HPLP-II summary scores), as well as, specifically, health responsibility, 
physical activity, nutrition, spiritual growth, stress management, and 
interpersonal relations behaviors from baseline to 6 months and from 6 months to 
12 months (all ps < 0.008). Health-promoting behaviors at 6 months (i.e., 
learned health-promoting behaviors) compared to baseline were better predictors 
of retention and program engagement. A fully digital, mobile weight management 
intervention can improve HPLP-II scores, which, in turn, has implications for 
improved retention, program engagement, and better understanding the 
comprehensive effects of weight management programs, particularly in a digital 
setting.

Improving protein structure prediction using templates and sequence embedding.

Wu F(1)(2)(3), Jing X(2), Luo X(2), Xu J(2).

MOTIVATION: Protein structure prediction has been greatly improved by deep 
learning, but the contribution of different information is yet to be fully 
understood. This article studies the impacts of two kinds of information for 
structure prediction: template and multiple sequence alignment (MSA) embedding. 
Templates have been used by some methods before, such as AlphaFold2, RoseTTAFold 
and RaptorX. AlphaFold2 and RosetTTAFold only used templates detected by 
HHsearch, which may not perform very well on some targets. In addition, sequence 
embedding generated by pre-trained protein language models has not been fully 
explored for structure prediction. In this article, we study the impact of 
templates (including the number of templates, the template quality and how the 
templates are generated) on protein structure prediction accuracy, especially 
when the templates are detected by methods other than HHsearch. We also study 
the impact of sequence embedding (generated by MSATransformer and ESM-1b) on 
structure prediction.
RESULTS: We have implemented a deep learning method for protein structure 
prediction that may take templates and MSA embedding as extra inputs. We study 
the contribution of templates and MSA embedding to structure prediction 
accuracy. Our experimental results show that templates can improve structure 
prediction on 71 of 110 CASP13 (13th Critical Assessment of Structure 
Prediction) targets and 47 of 91 CASP14 targets, and templates are particularly 
useful for targets with similar templates. MSA embedding can improve structure 
prediction on 63 of 91 CASP14 (14th Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction) 
targets and 87 of 183 CAMEO targets and is particularly useful for proteins with 
shallow MSAs. When both templates and MSA embedding are used, our method can 
predict correct folds (TMscore > 0.5) for 16 of 23 CASP14 FM targets and 14 of 
18 Continuous Automated Model Evaluation (CAMEO) targets, outperforming 
RoseTTAFold by 5% and 7%, respectively.

Costs and Outcomes Comparison of Diabetes Technology Usage Among People With 
Type 1 or 2 Diabetes Using Rapid-Acting Insulin.

Vallarino CR(1), Wong-Jacobson SH(1), Benneyworth BD(1), Meadows ES(1).

BACKGROUND: Does initiation of a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) or insulin 
pump lower health care utilization and/or costs?
METHODS: Distinct cohorts of people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) or type 2 
diabetes (T2D) using a blood glucose monitor (BGM), CGM, pump, or CGM with pump 
were identified from a large claims database. Patients ≥40 years old with 12 
months of continuous enrollment before and after the device start date qualified 
for the study. Outcomes included one-year medical utilization and costs (minus 
device) for events such as hospitalizations and office visits. Generalized 
linear models were fitted, controlling for numerous baseline covariates. The 
Holm method corrected for the multiplicity of hypotheses tested.
RESULTS: Of the 8235 total patients, the BGM control group was the largest, had 
the lowest percentage of patients with T1D, and was significantly different from 
the device groups in most baseline categories. Formally, only two comparisons 
were statistically significant: Compared with BGM, the pump cohort had greater 
adjusted first-year total medical and office visit costs. Other secondary 
outcomes such as days hospitalized, emergency department visits and labs, 
favored pump. Most endpoints were favorable for CGM. Results for CGM with pump 
generally were intermediate between CGM and pump alone.
CONCLUSIONS: During a one-year follow-up, unadjusted medical costs of both CGM 
and pump appear lower than BGM, but multivariable modeling yielded adjusted 
savings only for CGM use. Economic benefits might be observable sooner for CGMs 
than for pumps. Generalized linear models fitted to health care utilization 
event rates produced favorable results for both CGM and pump.

First Anti-Inflammatory Peptide AnmTX Sco 9a-1 from the Swimming Sea Anemone 
Stomphia coccinea.

AN(1), Rogozhin EA(2), Koshelev SG(2), Kozlov SA(2), Leychenko EV(1).

A novel peptide AnmTX Sco 9a-1 with the β-hairpin fold was isolated from the 
swimming sea anemone Stomphia coccinea (Actinostolidae family). The peptide 
consists of 28 amino acid residues, including modified hydroxyproline residue, 
and its measured molecular mass is 2960 Da. The peptide was not toxic on mice; 
however, it stimulated their exploratory motivation and active search behavior, 
and demonstrated an anti-anxiety effect. AnmTX Sco 9a-1 at doses of 0.1 and 1 
mg/kg reduced the volume of edema during 24 h better than the nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drug, Diclofenac, at dose of 1 mg/kg in a model of acute local 
λ-carrageenan-induced inflammation. ELISA analysis of the animal's blood showed 
that peptide at a dose of 1 mg/kg reduced the content of tumor necrosis factor-α 
(TNF-α), a pro-inflammatory mediator responsible in the edema development, up to 
the level of TNF-α in the intact group. Besides, AnmTX Sco 9a-1 demonstrated a 
significant analgesic effect on acute pain sensitivity in the 
carrageenan-induced thermal hyperalgesia model at doses of 0.1 and 1 mg/kg. 
Activity of AnmTX Sco 9a-1 was shown not to be associated with modulation of 
nociceptive ASIC channels.

Proteomics Reveals Damaging Effect of Alpha-Cypermethrin Exposure in a 
Non-Target Freshwater Microalga Chlorella sp. NC-MKM.

Chanu NK(1), Mandal MK(1), Srivastava A(2), Mishra Y(2), Chaurasia N(3).

Alpha-cypermethrin, a pyrethroid pesticide, is frequently used on crops to 
prevent insect attacks. However, occasionally, due to drift, leaching, or with 
rainwater, it enters the aquatic environment and poses a serious threat to the 
growth of non-target aquatic organisms. In the current study, we were interested 
in investigating the damaging effect of alpha-cypermethrin on a local freshwater 
non-target green alga Chlorella sp. NC-MKM in terms of its protein levels. This 
was achieved by exposing Chlorella sp. NC-MKM to an EC50 concentration of 
alpha-cypermethrin for 1 day, followed by the two-dimensional (2-D) gel 
electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF MS. Fifty-three proteins, which had showed 
significant differential accumulation (> 1.5 fold, P < 0.05) after exposure to 
alpha-cypermethrin, were considered as differentially accumulated proteins 
(DAPs). These DAPs were further divided into several functional categories, and 
the expressions of each in control and treatment samples were compared. 
Comparison revealed that alpha-cypermethrin exposure affects the accumulation of 
proteins related with photosynthesis, stress response, carbohydrate metabolism, 
signal transduction and transporters, translation, transcription, cell division, 
lipid metabolism, amino acid and nucleotide biosynthesis, secondary metabolites 
production, and post-translational modification, and thus rendered the tested 
algal isolate sensitive toward this pesticide. The overall findings of this 
research thus offer a fundamental understanding of the possible mechanism of 
action of the insecticide alpha-cypermethrin on the microalga Chlorella sp. 
NC-MKM and also suggest potential biomarkers for the investigation of pesticide 
exposed microalgae.

Immune cell targeted fumaric esters support a role of GPR109A as a primary 
target of monomethyl fumarate in vivo.

Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is approved as a treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS), 
however, its mode of action remains unclear. One hypothesis proposes that 
Michael addition to thiols by DMF, notably glutathione is immunomodulatory. The 
alternative proposes that monomethyl fumarate (MMF), the hydrolysis product of 
DMF, is a ligand to the fatty acid receptor GPR109A found in the lysosomes of 
immune cells. We prepared esters of MMF and macrolides derived from 
azithromycin, which were tropic to immune cells by virtue of lysosomal trapping. 
We tested the effects of these substances in an assay of response to 
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in freshly isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMCs). In this system, we observed that the 4'' ester of MMF (compound 2 
and 3) reduced levels of Interleukins (IL)-1β, IL-12 and tumor necrosis factor 
alpha (TNFα) significantly at a concentration of 1 µM, while DMF required about 
25 µM for the same effect. The 2' esters of MMF (compound 1 and 2) were, like 
MMF itself, inactive in vitro. The 4'' ester formed glutathione conjugates 
rapidly while the 2' conjugates did not react with thiols but did hydrolyze 
slowly to release MMF in these cells. We then tested the substances in vivo 
using the imiquimod/isostearate model of psoriasis where the 2' ester was the 
most active at 0.06-0.12 mg/kg (approximately 0.1 µmol/kg), improving skin 
score, body weight and cytokine levels (TNFα, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-6, IL-1β, NLRP3 
and IL-23A). In contrast, the thiol reactive 4'' ester was less active than the 
2' ester while DMF was ca. 300-fold less active. The thiol reactive 4'' ester 
was not easily recovered from either plasma or organs while the 2' ester 
exhibited conventional uptake and elimination. The 2' ester also reduced levels 
of IL-6 in acute monosodium urate (MSU) induced inflammation. These data suggest 
that mechanisms that are relevant in vivo center on the release of MMF. Given 
that GPR109A is localized to the lysosome, and that lysosomal trapping increases 
2' ester activity by > 300 fold, these data suggest that GPR109A may be the main 
target in vivo. In contrast, the effects associated with glutathione (GSH) 
conjugation in vitro are unlikely to be as effective in vivo due to the much 
lower dose in use which cannot titrate the more concentrated thiols. These data 
support the case for GPR109A modulation in autoimmune diseases.

Intrahepatic transcriptomics reveals gene signatures in chronic hepatitis B 
patients responded to interferon therapy.

Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a substantial public health 
burden worldwide. Alpha-interferon (IFNα) is one of the two currently approved 
therapies for chronic hepatitis B (CHB), to explore the mechanisms underlying 
IFNα treatment response, we investigated baseline and 24-week on-treatment 
intrahepatic gene expression profiles in 21 CHB patients by mRNA-seq. The data 
analyses demonstrated that PegIFNα treatment significantly induced antiviral 
responses. Responders who achieved HBV DNA loss and HBeAg or HBsAg 
seroconversion displayed higher fold change and larger number of up-regulated 
interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Interestingly, lower expression levels of 
certain ISGs were observed in responders in their baseline biopsy samples. In 
HBeAg+ patients, non-responders had relative higher baseline HBeAg levels than 
responders. More importantly, HBeAg- patients showed higher HBsAg loss rate than 
HBeAg+ patients. Although a greater fold change of ISGs was observed in HBeAg- 
patients than HBeAg+ patients, upregulation of ISGs in HBeAg+ responders 
exceeded HBeAg- responders. Notably, PegIFNα treatment increased monocyte and 
mast cell infiltration, but decreased CD8 T cell and M1 macrophage infiltration 
in both responders and non-responders, while B cell infiltration was increased 
only in responders. Moreover, co-expression analysis identified ribosomal 
proteins as critical players in antiviral response. The data also indicate that 
IFNα may influence the production of viral antigens associated with endoplasmic 
reticulum. Collectively, the intrahepatic transcriptome analyses in this study 
enriched our understanding of IFN-mediated antiviral effects in CHB patients and 
provided novel insights into the development of potential strategies to improve 
IFNα therapy.

Positive Regulation of Splicing of Cellular and Viral mRNA by Intragenic RNA 
Elements That Activate the Stress Kinase PKR, an Antiviral Mechanism.

Kaempfer R(1).

The transient activation of the cellular stress kinase, protein kinase 
RNA-activated (PKR), by double-helical RNA, especially by viral double-stranded 
RNA generated during replication, results in the inhibition of translation via 
the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 α-chain (eIF2α). 
Exceptionally, short intragenic elements within primary transcripts of the human 
tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and globin genes, genes essential for survival, 
can form RNA structures that strongly activate PKR and thereby render the 
splicing of their mRNAs highly efficient. These intragenic RNA activators of PKR 
promote early spliceosome assembly and splicing by inducing phosphorylation of 
nuclear eIF2α, without impairing the translation of the mature spliced mRNA. 
Unexpectedly, excision of the large human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) rev/tat 
intron was shown to require activation of PKR by the viral RNA and eIF2α 
phosphorylation. The splicing of rev/tat mRNA is abrogated by viral antagonists 
of PKR and by trans-dominant negative mutant PKR, yet enhanced by the 
overexpression of PKR. The TNFα and HIV RNA activators of PKR fold into compact 
pseudoknots that are highly conserved within the phylogeny, supporting their 
essential role in the upregulation of splicing. HIV provides the first example 
of a virus co-opting a major cellular antiviral mechanism, the activation of PKR 
by its RNA, to promote splicing.

The facile activation of graphite for the improved determination of dopamine, 
rutin and acetamidophenol.

Xu Y(1), Chen G(2), Qin Y(2), Xiao D(1)(3).

A glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was modified with graphite powder (G/GCE), and 
then treated with a solution of sodium peroxide for several minutes to prepare 
an oxidized G/GCE (OG/GCE). The OG/GCE has prominently improved responses toward 
dopamine (DA), rutin (RT) and acetamidophenol (APAP), of which the anodic peak 
current was increased by 2.4, 4.0 and 2.6 fold compared with that obtained using 
the G/GCE. The redox peaks of DA, RT and APAP on the OG/GCE could be separated 
sufficiently. The corresponding redox processes were confirmed as 
diffusion-controlled and parameters such as the charge transfer coefficients 
(α), saturating adsorption capacity (Γ*) and catalytic rate constant (kcat) were 
estimated. In individual detection, the linear ranges for DA, RT and APAP were 
10 nM-10 μM, 1.00 nM-150 nM and 20 nM-30 μM, respectively, and the LODs for DA, 
RT and APAP were estimated as 6.23 nM, 0.36 nM and 13.1 nM with 3σ/S, 
respectively. The contents of RT and APAP in drugs were determined and agreed 
with the labeled contents. The recoveries of DA in serum and sweat were in the 
range of 91-107%, indicating that the determination results achieved by the 
OG/GCE are reliable. The practical use of the method was verified with a 
graphite-modified screen-printed carbon electrode (G/SPCE), which was also 
activated by Na2O2 to prepare OG/SPCE. The recovery of DA in sweat achieved 
using the OG/SPCE was 91.26%.

Prediction of chaperonin GroE substrates using small structural patterns of 
proteins.

Minami S(1), Niwa T(2), Uemura E(2), Koike R(1), Taguchi H(2), Ota M(1)(3).

Molecular chaperones are indispensable proteins that assist the folding of 
aggregation-prone proteins into their functional native states, thereby 
maintaining organized cellular systems. Two of the best-characterized chaperones 
are the Escherichia coli chaperonins GroEL and GroES (GroE), for which in vivo 
obligate substrates have been identified by proteome-wide experiments. These 
substrates comprise various proteins but exhibit remarkable structural features. 
They include a number of α/β proteins, particularly those adopting the TIM β/α 
barrel fold. This observation led us to speculate that GroE obligate substrates 
share a structural motif. Based on this hypothesis, we exhaustively compared 
substrate structures with the MICAN alignment tool, which detects common 
structural patterns while ignoring the connectivity or orientation of secondary 
structural elements. We selected four (or five) substructures with hydrophobic 
indices that were mostly included in substrates and excluded in others, and 
developed a GroE obligate substrate discriminator. The substructures are 
structurally similar and superimposable on the 2-layer 2α4β sandwich, the most 
popular protein substructure, implying that targeting this structural pattern is 
a useful strategy for GroE to assist numerous proteins. Seventeen false 
positives predicted by our methods were experimentally examined using 
GroE-depleted cells, and 9 proteins were confirmed to be novel GroE obligate 
substrates. Together, these results demonstrate the utility of our common 
substructure hypothesis and prediction method.

Comparative analysis on visual and olfactory signals of Papilio xuthus 
(Lepidoptera: Papilionidae) during foraging and courtship.

Liu J(1), Li M(1), Chen S(1), Yao J(1), Shi L(1), Chen X(1).

This study examined the roles of visual and olfactory responses during foraging 
and courtship in butterfly Papilio xuthus. P. xuthus showed obvious orientation 
to color in the range of 350-500 nm. Visits of P. xuthus females and males to 
blue, purple, and red artificial cloth flowers were ♀ 54.90% and ♂ 39.22%, ♀ 
19.61% and ♂ 35.29%, and ♀ 9.80% and ♂ 19.61%, respectively. Application of 10% 
honey on these artificial flowers resulted in an increase of 3.41 and 3.26 fold 
in flower visits by the butterfly compared to controls. When 10% honey water was 
sprayed on flower branches without colorful flowers, branch visiting was very 
low, only seven times for females and two times for males, indicating that 
colors might be more critical than odor for foraging even though visual and 
olfactory perceptions both play important roles during foraging. During 
courtship, four types of chasing were observed in a natural population of P. 
Xuthus; the four types are males chasing females (49%), males chasing males 
(25%), females chasing males (13%), and females chasing females (10%). However, 
when odorless artificial models of butterflies were used, no significant 
differences were observed among these types of chasing, indicating that 
olfactory perception was crucial for the butterfly during courtship. Profiling 
volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) and individual bioassays revealed that VOCs 
contents of butterflies were not related to recognizing sex partners; by 
contrast, some level of α-farnesene, increased the frequency of male chasing 
female. This could be due to that α-farnesene is easy to be detected by 
butterflies because of its volatility and higher content in female.

Design and Optimization of an α-Helical Bundle Dimer Cell-Penetrating Peptide 
for In Vivo Drug Delivery.

Hyun S(1), Kim D(1), Cho J(1), Jeong D(2), Chung DH(2)(3), Yu J(1)(4).

To deliver membrane-impermeable drugs into eukaryotic cells, a lot of 
cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) were discovered. Previously we designed an 
amphipathic α-helical peptide which dimerizes itself via its two C-residues. 
This bis-disulfide-linked dimeric bundle, LK-3, has remarkable cell-penetrating 
ability at nanomolar concentration, which is an essential prerequisite for CPP. 
In an effort to optimize the sequence of LK-3, we adjusted its length and 
evaluated changes in the dimerization rate. We found that a 10-amino-acid 
monomer has the fastest dimerization rate and subsequently modified its 
hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues to construct a small peptide library. The 
evaluation of cell permeability of these derivatives showed that their 
cell-penetrating ability is comparable to that of the LK-3, except V- or 
H-containing ones. In this library, diLR10 was found to display fast nanomolar 
cell membrane penetration, low toxicity, and ease of production. The 
methotrexate (MTX) conjugate of diLR10, MTX-diLR10, has a 19-fold increased 
efficacy over MTX in MDA-MB-231 cells and efficiently deflates lesions in a 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in vivo mouse model.

An evolutionary history of the CoA-binding protein Nat/Ivy.

Longo LM(1)(2), Hirai H(1)(3), McGlynn SE(1)(2)(3)(4).

Nat/Ivy is a diverse and ubiquitous CoA-binding evolutionary lineage that 
catalyzes acyltransferase reactions, primarily converting thioesters into 
amides. At the heart of the Nat/Ivy fold is a phosphate-binding loop that bears 
a striking resemblance to that of P-loop NTPases-both are extended, glycine-rich 
loops situated between a β-strand and an α-helix. Nat/Ivy, therefore, represents 
an intriguing intersection between thioester chemistry, a putative primitive 
energy currency, and an ancient mode of phospho-ligand binding. Current evidence 
suggests that Nat/Ivy emerged independently of other cofactor-utilizing enzymes, 
and that the observed structural similarity-particularly of the cofactor binding 
site-is the product of shared constraints instead of shared ancestry. The 
reliance of Nat/Ivy on a β-α-β motif for CoA-binding highlights the extent to 
which this simple structural motif may have been a fundamental evolutionary 
"nucleus" around which modern cofactor-binding domains condensed, as has been 
suggested for HUP domains, Rossmanns, and P-loop NTPases. Finally, by dissecting 
the patterns of conserved interactions between Nat/Ivy families and CoA, the 
coevolution of the enzyme and the cofactor was analyzed. As with the Rossmann, 
it appears that the pyrophosphate moiety at the center of the cofactor predates 
the enzyme, suggesting that Nat/Ivy emerged sometime after the metabolite 
dephospho-CoA.

Graphene Oxide-Based Membranes Intercalated with an Aromatic Crosslinker for 
Low-Pressure Nanofiltration.

Kwon H(1), Park Y(1), Yang E(2), Bae TH(1).

Graphene oxide (GO), a carbonaceous 2D nanomaterial, has received significant 
interest as a next-generation membrane building block. To fabricate 
high-performance membranes, an effective strategy involves stacking GO 
nanosheets in laminated structures, thereby creating unique nanochannel 
galleries. One outstanding merit of laminar GO membranes is that their 
permselectivity is readily tunable by tailoring the size of the nanochannels. 
Here, a high-performance GO-based nanofiltration membrane was developed by 
intercalating an aromatic crosslinker, α,α/-dichloro-p-xylene (DCX), between the 
layers in laminated GO nanosheets. Owing to the formation of strong covalent 
bonds between the crosslinker and the GO, the resulting GO laminate membrane 
exhibited outstanding structural stability. Furthermore, due to the precisely 
controlled and enlarged interlayer spacing distance of the developed 
DCX-intercalated GO membrane, it achieved an over two-fold enhancement in water 
permeability (11 ± 2 LMH bar-1) without sacrificing the rejection performance 
for divalent ions, contrary to the case with a pristine GO membrane.

Molecular isolation and expression analysis of hemocyanin isoform 2 of 
Macrobrachium rosenbergii.

Srisuk C(1), Choolert C(2), Bendena WG(3), Longyant S(2)(4), Sithigorngul 
P(2)(4), Chaivisuthangkura P(2)(4).

OBJECTIVE: Hemocyanin is a copper-bearing protein in the hemolymph of many 
arthropods and mollusks and functions as an oxygen transport and important 
nonspecific immune protein.
METHODS: In this study, complementary DNA of hemocyanin isoform 2 of the prawn 
Macrobrachium rosenbergii (MrHc2) was isolated by rapid amplification of cDNA 
ends and mRNA expression was characterized to elucidate molecular basis of its 
function.
RESULT: With a molecular mass of 77.3 kDa, MrHc2 contained three domains: 
hemocyanin-all-alpha, hemocyanin-copper-containing, and 
hemocyanin-immunoglobulin-like domains. Molecular phylogenetic analysis revealed 
that MrHc2 belongs to the γ-type subunit and is closely related to hemocyanin 
subunit 1 of the palaemonid shrimp Macrobrachium nipponense. In addition, MrHc2 
resided in a different clade relative to hemocyanin (MrHc) of M. rosenbergii 
(α-type subunit) and in a different subclade relative to the hemocyanin proteins 
of penaeid shrimp. The messenger RNA transcript of MrHc2 was highly expressed in 
the hepatopancreas and weakly expressed in the gills, intestine, stomach, 
muscle, and hemocytes. Upon challenge with M. rosenbergii nodavirus (MrNV), the 
expression of MrHc2 was 1.96-, 2.93-, and 1.96-fold on days 3, 4, and 5, 
respectively, and then gradually declined to basal levels on day 7.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that MrHc2 plays an important role in the innate 
immune response of M. rosenbergii to MrNV.

S(1), Lindeman S(1), Sem DS(2), Donaldson WA(3).

Two (4-hydroxyphenyl) substituted polycyclic carbocycles were prepared and 
assayed for estrogen receptor activity. 
4-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)tricyclo[3.3.1.13,7]decane-1-methanol (5a/b) and 
7-(4-hydroxyphenyl)spiro[3.5]nonan-2-ol ((±)-11) were found to be potent ERβ 
agonists (1.9 ± 0.4 nM and 6.2 ± 1.4 nM respectively) in a cell-based functional 
assay. Furthermore, both 5a/b and 11 were highly selective for ERβ over ERα (377 
and 1,100-fold selective respectively). While neither compound inhibited CYP2D6 
or CYP3A4 at concentrations up to 62.5 μM, 5a/b did have weak binding to CYP2C9 
with an IC50 of 10 ± 0.5 μM. Computational assessment of 5a/b and 11 predicted 
the most probable site of metabolism would be ortho to the phenolic hydroxyl 
group.

Directed evolution of a neutrophilic and mesophilic methanol dehydrogenase based 
on high-throughput and accurate measurement of formaldehyde.

Wang Y(1)(6)(2)(5)(4).

Methanol is a promising one-carbon feedstock for biomanufacturing, which can be 
sustainably produced from carbon dioxide and natural gas. However, the 
efficiency of methanol bioconversion is limited by the poor catalytic properties 
of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent methanol dehydrogenase 
(Mdh) that oxidizes methanol to formaldehyde. Herein, the neutrophilic and 
mesophilic NAD+-dependent Mdh from Bacillus stearothermophilus DSM 2334 (MdhBs) 
was subjected to directed evolution for enhancing the catalytic activity. The 
combination of formaldehyde biosensor and Nash assay allowed high-throughput and 
accurate measurement of formaldehyde and facilitated efficient selection of 
desired variants. MdhBs variants with up to 6.5-fold higher Kcat/KM value for 
methanol were screened from random mutation libraries. The T153 residue that is 
spatially proximal to the substrate binding pocket has significant influence on 
enzyme activity. The beneficial T153P mutation changes the interaction network 
of this residue and breaks the α-helix important for substrate binding into two 
short α-helices. Reconstructing the interaction network of T153 with surrounding 
residues may represent a promising strategy to further improve MdhBs, and this 
study provides an efficient strategy for directed evolution of Mdh.

PDE12 in type 1 diabetes.

Tekin H(1), Josefsen K(1), Krogvold L(2)(3), Dahl-Jørgensen K(2)(3), Gerling 
I(4), Pociot F(5)(6), Buschard K(7).

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) incidence is increased after COVID-19 infection in 
children under 18 years of age. Interferon-α-activated oligoadenylate synthetase 
and downstream RNAseL activation degrade pathogen RNA, but can also damage host 
RNA when RNAseL activity is poorly regulated. One such regulator is PDE12 which 
degrades 2'-5' oligoadenylate units, thereby decreasing RNAseL activity. We 
analyzed PDE12 expression in islets from non-diabetic donors, individuals with 
newly (median disease duration 35 days) and recently (5 years) diagnosed T1D, 
and individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We also analyzed PDE12 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) relative to T1D incidence. PDE12 
expression was decreased in individuals with recently diagnosed T1D, in three of 
five individuals with newly diagnosed T1D, but not in individuals with T2D. Two 
rare PDE12 SNPs were found to have odds ratios of 1.80 and 1.74 for T1D 
development. We discuss whether decreased PDE12 expression after COVID-19 
infection might be part of the up to 2.5-fold increase in T1D incidence.

Infections with the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant exhibit fourfold increased viral

There has been a growing body of evidence that the severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Delta variant (B.1.617.2) shows enhanced 
transmissibility and increased viral loads compared to other variants. A recent 
study has even suggested that respiratory samples from people infected with the 
Delta variant can harbor up to 1000 times higher viral loads compared to samples 
with variants that are more closely related to the original Wuhan strain, 
although the sample size of this study (n = 125) was very limited. Here, we have 
compared the viral load in 16,185 samples that were obtained in periods during 
which non-VOC, the Alpha (B.1.1.7) or Delta variant (B.1.617.2) were dominant as 
evidenced by genomic surveillance. We found that the Delta variant contained 
about fourfold higher viral loads across all age groups compared to the non-VOC 
or Alpha variants, which is significantly lower than reported earlier. 
Interestingly, the increased viral load for the Delta variant seemed to be 
age-dependent, regardless of sex, as the viral load was about 14-fold higher for 
Delta compared to the non-VOC or Alpha variant in age group 0-20 years and 
fourfold higher in age group 21-40 years, while there was no difference in viral 
load between variants in age groups 41-60 and 61+ years, most likely as a 
consequence of a higher degree of vaccination in the older age groups.

Patentology of chitinous biomaterials. Part II: chitosan.

Kertmen A(1), Dziedzic I(2), Ehrlich H(3).

Cationic chitosan is recognized as the most widely studied derivative of chitin, 
one of the main and the most evolutionary ancient structural biopolymer in 
nature. The multi-functionality of chitosan, due to its specific physicochemical 
properties, biodegradability and biocompatibility, is a fundamental factor in 
the patentability of this biopolymer in diverse fields of modern science and 
technology. It is shown that the chitosan-related patents were categorized 
mainly under biomedical, material science, biotechnology, and chemical 
directions; while a very small portion of the patents were mentioned under food, 
cosmetics, environmental protection, and agricultural fields. For the first 
time, the review provides a detailed analysis on the background and scope of the 
patents reported on chitosan so far.

Regional risk of tuberculosis and viral hepatitis with tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha inhibitor treatment: A systematic review.

Jahnich N(1), Arkwright PD(1).

Background: TNFα inhibitors are regularly used to treat autoimmune diseases. 
Tuberculosis (TB) and viral hepatitis B are considered potential infectious 
complications, and screening and surveillance are therefore recommended. Current 
guidelines do not take into account regional differences in endemicity of these 
infections. Methods: A systematic literature review of TB and viral hepatitis in 
patients receiving TNFα-inhibitors was performed, searching in PubMed, Embase, 
MEDLINE and Web of Science databases. Studies were selected against predefined 
eligibility criteria and assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. The number 
of TB and viral hepatitis cases/1,000 TNFα-inhibitor patients were evaluated, 
and regional variation compared. Results: 105 observational studies involving 
over 140,000 patients were included. Overall, 1% of patients developed TB or 
viral hepatitis B. TB cases/1,000 TNFα-inhibitor patients were 4-fold higher in 
Asia, Africa, and South America than in Europe, North America, and Australasia 
where only 0%-0.4% of patients developed TB. Hepatitis B cases/1,000 patients 
were over 15-fold higher in countries with high prevalence (China, Taiwan, South 
Korea, Thailand) compared with low prevalence (p < 0.00001) where only 0.4% of 
patients developed hepatitis B. Only three of 143 patients developed viral 
hepatitis C, and there was insufficient data to allow regional sub-analysis. 
Conclusion: TB and viral hepatitis B infections in patients treated with TNFα 
inhibitors are largely confined to countries with high prevalence of these 
infections. As only 1/2,500 patients in low prevalence countries treated with 
TNFα inhibitors develop TB or viral hepatitis B, we suggest an individualized, 
risk-based approach, rather than universal screening for all patients.

Smooth muscle matrix bioink promotes myogenic differentiation of encapsulated 
adipose-derived stem cells.

Yeleswarapu S(1), Chameettachal S(1), Bera AK(1), Pati F(1).

Hydrogels derived from decellularized extracellular matrices (dECM) can mimic 
the biochemical composition of the native tissue. They can also act as a 
template to culture reseeded cells in vitro. However, detergent-based 
decellularization methods are known to alter the biochemical compositions, 
thereby compromising the bioactive potential of dECM. This study proposes a 
facile detergent-free method to achieve dECM from smooth muscle tissue. We have 
used the muscle layer of caprine esophageal tissue and decellularized using hypo 
and hyper-molar sodium chloride solutions alternatingly. Then, a hydrogel was 
prepared from this decellularized smooth muscle matrix (dSMM) and characterized 
thoroughly. A comparative analysis of the dSMM prepared with our protocol with 
the existing detergent-based protocol suggests successful and comparable 
decellularization with minimal residual DNA content. Interestingly, an 8.78-fold 
increase in sulfated glycosaminoglycans content and 1.62-fold increased collagen 
content indicated higher retention of ECM constituents with NaCl-based 
decellularization strategy. Moreover, the dSMM gel induces differentiation of 
the encapsulated adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells toward smooth muscle 
cells (SMCs) as observed by their expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin and 
smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, the hallmarks of SMCs. Finally, we optimized 
the process parameter for productive bioprinting with this dSMM bioink and 
fabricated 3D muscle constructs. Our results suggest that dSMM has the potential 
to be used as a bioink to engineer personalized esophageal tissues.

A Constitutive Model to Characterize In Vivo Human Palmar Tissue.

Shojaeizadeh M(1), Spartacus V(1), Sparrey CJ(2).

In vivo characteristics of palmar soft tissue can be used to improve the 
accuracy of human models to explore and simulate a range of contact scenarios. 
Tissue characteristics can help to assess injury prevention strategies and 
designing technologies that depend on quantified physical contacts such as 
prosthetics, wearables, and assistive devices. In this study, a simplified 
quasi-linear viscoelastic (QLV) model was developed to quantify large 
deformation, in vivo soft tissue relaxation characteristics of the palm. We 
conducted relaxation tests on 11 young adults (6 males, 5 females, 
18 < age < 30, mean age: 25 ± 4 yr) and 9 older adults (6 males, 3 females, 
age > 50, mean age: 61.5 ± 11.5 yr) using a 3 mm indenter to a depth of 50% of 
each participant's soft tissue thickness. The relaxation parameters of the QLV 
model were found to differ with age and sex, emphasizing the importance of using 
targeted material models to represent palmar soft tissue mechanics. Older adults 
showed on average 2.3-fold longer relaxation time constant compared to younger 
adults. It took 1.2-fold longer for young males to reach equilibrium than for 
young females; however, young females had a higher level of relaxation (36%) 
than young males (33%). Differences in specific QLV model parameters, P1, P2, 
and α were also found between age and sex groups. QLV characteristics 
differentiated by age and sex, add biofidelity to computational models which can 
provide a better representation of the diversity of tissue properties in the 
population.

Enhanced expression of xylanase in Aspergillus niger enabling a two-step 
enzymatic pathway for extracting β-glucan from oat bran.

J(5), Li J(1), Du G(1), Liu S(6).

The high cost and process complexity limit the enzymatic extraction of β-glucan. 
In this study, β-glucan was extracted from oat bran in a two-step enzymatic 
pathway using a recombinant strain of Aspergillus niger AG11 overexpressing the 
endogenous xylanase (xynA) and amylolytic enzyme. First, co-optimization of 
promoter and signal peptide and a fusion of glucoamylase (glaA) fragment were 
integrated into the β-glucosidase (bgl) locus to improve xynA expression. Then, 
the optimized expression cassette was simultaneously integrated into bgl, 
α-amylase amyA, and acid α-amylase ammA loci, yielding the Rbya with 3,650-fold 
and 31.2% increase in xynA and amylolytic enzyme activity than the wild-type 
strain, respectively. Finally, Rbya's supernatants at 72 h (rich in xynA and 
amylolytic enzyme) and 10 d (rich in proteases) were used to decompose 
xylan/starch and proteins in oat bran, respectively, to obtain 85.1% pure 
β-glucan. Rbya could be a robust candidate for the cost-effective extraction of 
β-glucan.

Expression and regulation of recently discovered hyaluronidases, HYBID and 
TMEM2, in chondrocytes from knee osteoarthritic cartilage.

Momoeda M(2), Nakamura T(4), Yoshida H(4), Kaneko H(2), Ishijima M(1)(2)(3), 
Okada Y(5)(6).

Destruction of articular cartilage in osteoarthritis (OA) is initiated by 
depletion of the hyaluronan (HA)-aggrecan network, followed by degradation of 
the collagen fibrils. Previously, we reported the implications of HA-binding 
protein involved in HA depolymerization (HYBID), alias cell migration-inducing 
protein (CEMIP) and KIAA1199, for HA degradation. However, transmembrane protein 
2 (TMEM2), which is ~ 50% homologous to HYBID, was discovered as another 
hyaluronidase, but their expression and regulation by OA chondrocytes remain 
elusive. Here we report that the absolute mRNA copy numbers of HYBID are 
significantly (7.1-fold) higher in OA cartilage than normal cartilage, whereas 
TMEM2 levels are not different between the groups. HA-degrading activity of 
cultured OA chondrocytes disappeared by siRNA-mediated knockdown of HYBID, but 
not TMEM2. HYBID expression was significantly up-regulated by treatment with 
interleukin-6 (IL-6) or tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and additively increased 
by the combined treatment. No significant changes in the TMEM2 expression were 
seen by the factors examined. IL-1α remarkably enhanced IL-6 production and 
increased HYBID expression when soluble IL-6 receptor was supplemented. These 
results demonstrate that in stark contrast to the constitutive expression of 
TMEM2 and its negligible HA-degrading activity, HYBID is overexpressed in OA 
cartilage and up-regulated by IL-6 and TNF-α in OA chondrocytes.

A retrospective, longitudinal study of rheumatoid arthritis treatment patterns 
with Janus kinase inhibitors and other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in 
Japan.

Kaneko Y(1), Sakurai M(2), Snijder R(3), Kokubo S(2), Kato D(2).

OBJECTIVES: There is limited information on the clinical use of Janus kinase 
inhibitors (JAKis) for rheumatoid arthritis treatment in Japan. The aim of this 
study was to identify disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) treatment 
patterns in Japan.
METHODS: This retrospective, longitudinal study extracted data from the Japan 
Medical Data Center database. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis were 
enrolled 2016-19, during which patients had a first prescription of a major 
DMARD, split into six mutually exclusive classes: methotrexate (MTX); other 
conventional synthetic DMARDs; tumour necrosis factor alpha inhibitors; 
cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4-immunoglobulin; anti-interleukin-6 
receptor therapies; and JAKis. The primary objective was to describe DMARD 
treatment patterns, especially for JAKis.
RESULTS: Overall, 10,399 patients were included in the analysis. The most common 
treatments were MTX, other conventional synthetic DMARDs, and tumour necrosis 
factor alpha inhibitors. The total number of JAKi prescriptions increased 
approximately 8-fold during 2016-19. Most (61.1%) patients who received JAKis 
had prior MTX or tumour necrosis factor alpha inhibitor treatment. The duration 
of JAKi treatment was longer than for biologics and other conventional synthetic 
DMARDs and comparable to that of MTX.
CONCLUSIONS: The sequence of drug class prescriptions for rheumatoid arthritis 
in Japan during 2016-19 followed clinical guidelines. Over this period, JAKis 
were increasingly used as a second-line treatment following MTX.

Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Model of Brain Delivery of Plasma Protein 
Bound Drugs.

Pardridge WM(1).

INTRODUCTION: A physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model is developed 
that focuses on the kinetic parameters of drug association and dissociation with 
albumin, alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AGP), and brain tissue proteins, as well as 
drug permeability at the blood-brain barrier, drug metabolism, and brain blood 
flow.
GOAL: The model evaluates the extent to which plasma protein-mediated uptake 
(PMU) of drugs by brain influences the concentration of free drug both within 
the brain capillary compartment in vivo and the brain compartment. The model 
also studies the effect of drug binding to brain tissue proteins on the 
concentration of free drug in brain.
METHODS: The steady state and non-steady state PBPK models are comprised of 
11-12 variables, and 18-23 parameters, respectively. Two model drugs are 
analyzed: propranolol, which undergoes modest PMU from the AGP-bound pool, and 
imipramine, which undergoes a high degree of PMU from both the albumin-bound and 
AGP-bound pools in plasma.
RESULTS: The free propranolol concentration in brain is under-estimated 2- to 
fourfold by in vitro measurements of free plasma propranolol, and the free 
imipramine concentration in brain is under-estimated by 18- to 31-fold by in 
vitro measurements of free imipramine in plasma. The free drug concentration in 
brain in vivo is independent of drug binding to brain tissue proteins.
CONCLUSIONS: In vitro measurement of free drug concentration in plasma 
under-estimates the free drug in brain in vivo if PMU in vivo from either the 
albumin and/or the AGP pools in plasma takes place at the BBB surface.

Tumour associated vasculature-on-a-chip for the evaluation of 
microbubble-mediated delivery of targeted liposomes.

Bourn MD(1)(2), Mohajerani SZ(2), Mavria G(2), Ingram N(2), Coletta PL(2), Evans 
SD(1), Peyman SA(1)(2).

The vascular system is the primary route for the delivery of therapeutic drugs 
throughout the body and is an important barrier at the region of disease 
interest, such as a solid tumour. The development of complex 3D tumour cultures 
has progressed significantly in recent years however, the generation of 
perfusable vascularised tumour models still presents many challenges. This study 
presents a microfluidic-based vasculature system that can be induced to display 
properties of tumour-associated blood vessels without direct incorporation of 
tumour cells. Conditioning healthy endothelial-fibroblast cell vasculature 
co-cultures with media taken from tumour cell cultures was found to result in 
the formation of disorganised, tortuous networks which display characteristics 
consistent with those of tumour-associated vasculature. Integrin αvβ3, a cell 
adhesion receptor associated with angiogenesis, was found to be upregulated in 
vasculature co-cultures conditioned with tumour cell media (TCM) - consistent 
with the reported αvβ3 expression pattern in angiogenic tumour vasculature in 
vivo. Increased accumulation of liposomes (LSs) conjugated to antibodies against 
αvβ3 was observed in TCM networks compared to non-conditioned networks, 
indicating αvβ3 may be a potential target for the delivery of drugs specifically 
to tumour vasculature. Furthermore, the use of microbubbles (MBs) and ultrasound 
(US) to further enhance the delivery of LSs to TCM-conditioned vasculature was 
investigated. Quantification of fluorescent LS accumulation post-perfusion of 
the vascular network showed 3-fold increased accumulation with the use of MBs 
and US, suggesting that targeted LS delivery could be further improved with the 
use of locally administered MBs and US.

Temporal Release and Denature of Several Mediators in Pure Platelet-Rich Plasma 
and Temperature-Induced Platelet Lysates Derived from a Similar Bovine Platelet 
Concentrate.

Carmona JU(1), López C(2), Ceballos-Márquez A(3).

There is scarce information about bovine platelet-rich plasma/platelet-rich gel 
(PRP/PRG) and related hemocomponents (HCs), such as platelet lysates (PLs), 
including growth factor (GF) and cytokine concentrations, and how the stability 
of these biomolecules could be affected by time and temperature. This study 
aimed to evaluate the release and stability of transforming growth factor beta 1 
(TGF-β 1), interleukin 4 (IL-4), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) 
contained in bovine pure PRP (P-PRP) and temperature-induced PL (TIPL) coming 
from a similar platelet concentrate (PC) at 4 and 37°C at 3 and 96 h. Platelet 
concentrates (PCs) presented a 1.7-fold concentration of platelets (PLTs) with 
negligible counts of white blood cells (WBCs) when compared to the counts for 
these cells in whole blood. TGF-β 1 concentrations were significantly lowest in 
plasma followed by TIPL, chemical-induced PL (CIPL), and P-PRP. IL-4 and TNF-α 
concentrations did not differ between HCs. TGF-β 1 concentrations were 
negatively affected in P-PRPs stored at 4°C at 3 and 96 h, whereas those from 
P-PRP maintained at 37°C presented similar concentrations to TIPL stored at both 
temperatures over time. IL-4 and TNF-α concentrations were not affected by time 
or temperature in any of the HCs evaluated. Pure PRGs released additional 
quantities of GF and cytokines over time when compared with HCs stored over 96 h 
at 4 and 37°C. The method, either chemical or physical, used for platelet 
activation or damage produces a different GF and cytokine release pattern, which 
makes to each evaluated HCs different despite they come from a similar bovine 
PC. P-PRP activated with calcium gluconate and maintained at 37°C, which 
polymerizes in P-PRG, showed the best GF and cytokine release/denature profile 
compared with the rest of the HCs evaluated.

Changes in the cocoa shell dietary fiber and phenolic compounds after extrusion 
determine its functional and physiological properties.

Benítez V(1)(2), Rebollo-Hernanz M(1)(2), Braojos C(1)(2), Cañas S(1)(2), 
Gil-Ramírez A(1)(2), Aguilera Y(1)(2), Martín-Cabrejas MA(1)(2).

The influence of different extrusion conditions on the cocoa shell (CS) dietary 
fiber, phenolic compounds, and antioxidant and functional properties was 
evaluated. Extrusion produced losses in the CS dietary fiber (3-26%), especially 
in the insoluble fraction, being more accentuated at higher temperatures 
(160 °C) and lower moisture feed (15-20%). The soluble fiber fraction 
significantly increased at 135 °C because of the solubilization of galactose- 
and glucose-containing insoluble polysaccharides. The extruded CS treated at 
160 °C-25% of feed moisture showed the highest increase of total (27%) and free 
(58%) phenolic compounds, accompanied by an increase of indirect (10%) and 
direct (77%) antioxidant capacity. However, more promising results relative to 
the phenolic compounds' bioaccessibility after in vitro simulated digestion were 
observed for 135°C-15% of feed moisture extrusion conditions. The CS' 
physicochemical and techno-functional properties were affected by extrusion, 
producing extrudates with higher bulk density, a diminished capacity to hold oil 
(22-28%) and water (18-65%), and improved swelling properties (14-35%). The 
extruded CS exhibited increased glucose adsorption capacity (up to 2.1-fold, at 
135 °C-15% of feed moisture) and α-amylase in vitro inhibitory capacity 
(29-54%), accompanied by an increase in their glucose diffusion delaying ability 
(73-91%) and their starch digestion retardation capacity (up to 2.8-fold, at 
135 °C-15% of feed moisture). Moreover, the extruded CS preserved its 
cholesterol and bile salts binding capacity and pancreatic lipase inhibitory 
properties. These findings generated knowledge of the CS valorization through 
extrusion to produce foods rich in dietary fiber with improved health-promoting 
properties due to the extrusion-triggered fiber solubilization.

Resistance profile and mechanism of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus-2 variants to LCB1 inhibitor targeting the spike receptor-binding 
motif.

Wu T(1), Zhu Y(1), Liu N(1), Hu Y(1), Chong H(1), He Y(1).

LCB1 is a 56-mer miniprotein computationally designed to target the spike (S) 
receptor-binding motif of SARS-CoV-2 with potent in vitro and in vivo inhibitory 
activities (Cao et al., 2020; Case et al., 2021). However, the rapid emergence 
and epidemic of viral variants have greatly impacted the effectiveness of S 
protein-targeting vaccines and antivirals. In this study, we chemically 
synthesized a peptide-based LCB1 inhibitor and characterized the resistance 
profile and underlying mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Among five variants of 
concern (VOCs), we found that pseudoviruses of Beta, Gamma, and Omicron were 
highly resistant to the LCB1 inhibition, whereas the pseudoviruses of Alpha and 
Delta as well as the variant of interest (VOI) Lambda only caused mild 
resistance. By generating a group of mutant viruses carrying single or 
combination mutations, we verified that K417N and N501Y substitutions in RBD 
critically determined the high resistance phenotype of VOCs. Furthermore, a 
large panel of 85 pseudoviruses with naturally occurring RBD point-mutations 
were generated and applied to LCB1, which identified that E406Q, K417N, and 
L455F conferred high-levels of resistance, when Y505W caused a ∼6-fold 
resistance fold-change. We also showed that the resistance mutations could 
greatly weaken the binding affinity of LCB1 to RBD and thus attenuated its 
blocking capacity on the interaction between RBD and the cell receptor ACE2. In 
conclusion, our data have provided crucial information for understanding the 
mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 resistance to LCB1 and will guide the design strategy of 
novel LCB1-based antivirals against divergent VOCs and evolutionary mutants.

The effect of chitosan and β-cyclodextrin on glucosinolate biosynthesis in 
Brassica rapa ssp. pekinensis (Chinese cabbage) shoot culture.

Sivanandhan G(1), Kapildev G(2), Selvaraj N(3), Lim YP(4).

Chitosan is a polycationic polysaccharide derived from chitin, and 
β-cyclodextrin is a type of macrocyclic oligosaccharide linked by α-1,4 
glycosidic bonds. These compounds are recognized as effective elicitors in the 
biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in plants. These elicitors were studied to 
assess the growth of shoots and the synthesis of glucosinolates (GSLs) from 
elicited shoots in Chinese cabbage under controlled in vitro conditions for the 
first time. Chitosan at 150 mg L-1 supplemented in the optimized shoot induction 
recovered maximum quantities of total GSLs (7.344 μmol g-1 DW) at the end of 5th 
week of culture duration, followed by β-cyclodextrin (15 mg L-1) with the 
synthesis of GSLs (6.379 μmol g-1 DW) at the end of 4th week of culture. The 
application of chitosan completely deteriorated the growth of shoots, whereas 
β-cyclodextrin did not affect and even increased the growth of shoots (4.66 g 
DW). Upon elicitation, the individual got GSLs contents exhibited various fold 
changes (1.78-to-23.5-fold). Real-time PCR analysis of essential GSLs 
biosynthesis genes like MAM1, ST5b, AOP2, FMOGS-OX1, CYP83B1, CYP81F2, ST5a, and 
CYP81F4 revealed substantial higher expression upon elicitation. This present 
study would provide a steady production of GSLs in Chinese cabbage shoots with 
the influence of carbohydrate-based elicitors for pharmaceutical or food 
companies in the future.

Endotoxin-free gram-negative bacterium as a system for production and secretion 
of recombinant proteins.

Shahar E(#)(1)(2), Emquies K(#)(1)(2), Bloch I(1), Eliahu D(1), Ben Adiva R(1), 
Pitcovski J(1)(2), Yadid I(3)(4).

Gram-negative bacteria are common and efficient protein expression systems, yet 
their outer membrane endotoxins can elicit undesirable toxic effects, limiting 
their applicability for parenteral therapeutic applications, e.g., production of 
vaccine components. In the bacterial genus Sphingomonas from the 
Alphaproteobacteria class, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxins are replaced with 
non-toxic glycosphingolipids (GSL), rendering it an attractive alternative for 
therapeutic protein production. To explore the use of sphingomonas as a safe 
expression system for production of proteins for therapeutic applications, in 
this study, Sphingobium japonicum (SJ) injected live into embryonated hen eggs 
proved safe and nontoxic. Multimeric viral polypeptides derived from Newcastle 
disease virus (NDV) designed for expression in SJ, yielded soluble proteins 
which were specifically recognized by antibodies raised against the whole virus. 
In addition, native signal peptide (SP) motifs coupled to secreted proteins in 
SJ identified using whole-genome computerized analysis, induced secretion of 
α Amylase (αAmy) and mCherry gene products. Relative to the same genes expressed 
without an SP, SP 104 increased the secretion of αAmy (3.7-fold) and mCherry 
(16.3-fold) proteins and yielded accumulation of up to 80 µg/L of the later in 
the culture medium. Taken together, the presented findings demonstrate the 
potential of this unique LPS-free gram-negative bacterial family to serve as an 
important tool for protein expression for both research and biotechnological 
purposes, including for the development of novel vaccines and as a live bacteria 
delivery system for protein vaccines. KEY POINTS: • Novel molecular tools for 
protein expression in non-model bacteria. • Bacteria with GSL instead of LPS as 
a potential vector for protein delivery.

Association Between Oral Bacteria and Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review 
and Meta-Analysis.

Liu S(1), Dashper SG(2), Zhao R(3).

BACKGROUND: Pre-clinical evidence implicates oral bacteria in the pathogenesis 
of Alzheimer's disease (AD), while clinical studies show diverse results.
OBJECTIVE: To comprehensively assess the association between oral bacteria and 
AD with clinical evidence.
METHODS: Studies investigating the association between oral bacteria and AD were 
identified through a systematic search of six databases PubMed, Embase, Cochrane 
Central Library, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science. Methodological 
quality ratings of the included studies were performed. A best evidence 
synthesis was employed to integrate the results. When applicable, a 
meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effect model.
RESULTS: Of the 16 studies included, ten investigated periodontal pathobionts 
and six were microbiome-wide association studies. Samples from the brain, serum, 
and oral cavity were tested. We found over a ten-fold and six-fold increased 
risk of AD when there were oral bacteria (OR = 10.68 95% CI: 4.48-25.43; 
p < 0.00001, I2 = 0%) and Porphyromonas gingivalis (OR = 6.84 95% CI: 
2.70-17.31; p < 0.0001, I2 = 0%) respectively in the brain. While AD patients 
exhibited lower alpha diversity of oral microbiota than healthy controls, the 
findings of bacterial communities were inconsistent among studies. The best 
evidence synthesis suggested a moderate level of evidence for an overall 
association between oral bacteria and AD and for oral bacteria being a risk 
factor for AD.
CONCLUSION: Current evidence moderately supports the association between oral 
bacteria and AD, while the association was strong when oral bacteria were 
detectable in the brain. Further evidence is needed to clarify the 
interrelationship between both individual species and bacterial communities and 
the development of AD.

Directed Evolution of (R)-2-Hydroxyglutarate Dehydrogenase Improves 2-Oxoadipate 
Reduction by 2 Orders of Magnitude.

V(1), Engqvist MKM(4), Olsson L(1).

Pathway engineering is commonly employed to improve the production of various 
metabolites but may incur in bottlenecks due to the low catalytic activity of a 
particular reaction step. The reduction of 2-oxoadipate to (R)-2-hydroxyadipate 
is a key reaction in metabolic pathways that exploit 2-oxoadipate conversion via 
α-reduction to produce adipic acid, an industrially important platform chemical. 
Here, we engineered (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase from Acidaminococcus 
fermentans (Hgdh) with the aim of improving 2-oxoadipate reduction. Using a 
combination of computational analysis, saturation mutagenesis, and random 
mutagenesis, three mutant variants with a 100-fold higher catalytic efficiency 
were obtained. As revealed by rational analysis of the mutations found in the 
variants, this improvement could be ascribed to a general synergistic effect 
where mutation A206V played a key role since it boosted the enzyme's activity by 
4.8-fold. The Hgdh variants with increased activity toward 2-oxoadipate 
generated within this study pave the way for the bio-based production of adipic 
acid.

Optimization of the hongqu starter preparation process for the manufacturing of 
red mold rice with high gamma-aminobutyric acid production by solid-state 
fermentation.

Wu A(1), Li L(1), Zhang S(1), Lin Q(1), Liu J(1)(2).

Red mold rice (RMR) generally contains gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which has 
several physiological functions. Monascus purpureus M162, with a high GABA 
production of 15.10 mg/g was generated by atmospheric and room temperature 
plasma mutation. Furthermore, we conducted a response surface methodology to 
produce a premium hongqu starter. The results revealed that under optimal 
conditions, that is, a substrate containing brown rice and bran in a brown rice: 
bran ratio of 9:1 (wt/wt), an inoculation size of 21.50 mL/100 g, a mixing 
frequency of one time/9 h, and a cultivation time of 7.20 days, the number of 
active spores, α-amylase activity, and saccharification power activity was 4.15 
× 107 spores/g, 155 U/g, and 3260 U/g in the high-quality starter, respectively. 
These values were 224.32-fold, 139.64%, and 141.74% higher than those obtained 
with M. purpureus M162 inoculated into steamed indica rice, respectively, and 
153.70-fold, 267.24%, and 151.63% higher than those obtained with the parent 
strain M. purpureus M1, respectively. The premium hongqu starter of M. purpureus 
M162 was inoculated into steamed indica rice to produce RMR with 15.93 mg/g of 
GABA. In conclusion, we proposed a novel strategy for functional RMR production 
with high GABA concentrations by solid-state fermentation with Monascus spp.

Energetics of the Glycosyl Transfer Reactions of Sucrose Phosphorylase.

Vyas A(1), Nidetzky B(1)(2).

From its structure and mechanism, sucrose phosphorylase is a specialized 
glycoside hydrolase that uses phosphate ions instead of water as the nucleophile 
of the reaction. Unlike the hydrolysis reaction, the phosphate reaction is 
readily reversible and, here, this has enabled the study of temperature effects 
on kinetic parameters to map the energetic profile of the complete catalytic 
process via a covalent glycosyl enzyme intermediate. Enzyme glycosylation from 
sucrose and α-glucose 1-phosphate (Glc1P) is rate-limiting in the forward (kcat 
= 84 s-1) and reverse direction (kcat = 22 s-1) of reaction at 30 °C. 
Enzyme-substrate association is driven by entropy (TΔSb ≥ +23 kJ/mol), likely 
arising from enzyme desolvation at the binding site for the leaving group. 
Approach from the ES complex to the transition state involves uptake of heat 
(ΔH⧧ = 72 ± 5.2 kJ/mol) with little further change in entropy. The free energy 
barrier for the enzyme-catalyzed glycoside bond cleavage in the substrate is 
much lower than that for the non-enzymatic reaction (knon), ΔΔG⧧ = ΔGnon⧧ - 
ΔGenzyme⧧ = +72 kJ/mol; sucrose. This ΔΔG⧧, which also describes the virtual 
binding affinity of the enzyme for the activated substrate in the transition 
state (∼1014 M-1), is almost entirely enthalpic in origin. The enzymatic rate 
acceleration (kcat/knon) is ∼1012-fold and similar for reactions of sucrose and 
Glc1P. The 103-fold lower reactivity (kcat/Km) of glycerol than fructose in 
enzyme deglycosylation reflects major losses in the activation entropy, 
suggesting a role of nucleophile/leaving group recognition by the enzyme in 
inducing the active-site preorganization required for optimum transition state 
stabilization by enthalpic forces.

Association of dengue infection with anti-alpha-gal antibodies, IgM, IgG, IgG1, 
and IgG2.

Olajiga OM(1), Maldonado-Ruiz LP(1), Fatehi S(1), Cardenas JC(2), Gonzalez 
MU(3), Gutierrez-Silva LY(4), Londono-Renteria B(1)(5), Park Y(1).

Dengue virus (DENV) transmitted by the Aedes mosquitoes is the etiological agent 
of dengue fever, one of the fastest-growing reemerging mosquito-borne diseases 
on the planet with a 30-fold surge in the last five decades. Interestingly, many 
arthropod-borne pathogens, including DENV type 2, have been reported to contain 
an immunogenic glycan galactose-alpha1,3-galactose (alpha-Gal or aGal). The aGal 
molecule is a common oligosaccharide found in many microorganisms and in most 
mammals, except for humans and the Old-World primates. The loss of aGal in 
humans is considered to be an evolutionary innovation for enabling the 
production of specific antibodies against aGal that could be presented on the 
glycan of pathogens. The objective of this study was to evaluate different 
anti-aGal antibodies (IgM, IgG, IgG1, and IgG2) in people exposed to DENV. We 
observed a significant difference in anti-aGal IgG and IgG1 levels among dengue 
severity classifications. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation was 
observed between the anti-aGal IgG and the number of days with dengue symptoms 
in patients. Additionally, both anti-aGal IgM and IgG levels differ between the 
two geographical locations of patients. While the anti-aGal IgM and IgG2 levels 
were not significantly different according to the dengue severity levels, age 
was negatively correlated with anti-aGal IgM and positively correlated with 
anti-aGal IgG2. Significant involvement of aGal antibodies in Dengue infection 
processes is suggested based on the results. Our results open the need for 
further studies on the exact roles and the mechanisms of the aGal antibodies in 
Dengue infection.

Differences in environmental stability among SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern: 
both omicron BA.1 and BA.2 have higher stability.

Hirose R(1), Itoh Y(2), Ikegaya H(3), Miyazaki H(4), Watanabe N(4), Yoshida 
T(4), Bandou R(5), Daidoji T(6), Nakaya T(6).

OBJECTIVES: The increased infectivity and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 
variants of concern (VOCs) could cause significant human and economic damage. 
Hence, understanding their characteristics is crucial to control infection. We 
evaluated the environmental stability of the Wuhan strain and all VOCs (Alpha, 
Beta, Gamma, Delta, Omicron BA.1, and Omicron BA.2 variants) on plastic and 
human skin surfaces and their disinfection efficacy.
METHODS: To evaluate environmental stability, residual virus titres on plastic 
and human skin surfaces were measured over time. Their survival time and 
half-life were calculated using regression analysis. The effectiveness of 
ethanol-based disinfectants at different concentrations was determined by 
in vitro and ex vivo evaluations.
RESULTS: On plastic and skin surfaces, the Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron 
variants exhibited approximately two-fold longer survival times than the Wuhan 
strain; the Omicron variants had the longest survival time. The median survival 
times of the Wuhan strain and the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron (BA.1 
and BA.2) variants on human skin surface were 8.6, 19.6, 19.1, 11.0, 16.8, 21.1, 
and 22.5 h, respectively. The in vitro evaluation showed that the Wuhan strain 
and the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron (BA.1 and BA.2) variants were 
completely inactivated within 15 s by 32.5%, 35%, 35%, 32.5%, 35%, 40%, and 40% 
ethanol, respectively. However, all viruses on human skin were completely 
inactivated by exposure to 35% ethanol for 15 s.
CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, especially the Omicron variants, have higher 
environmental stability than the Wuhan strain, increasing their transmission 
risk and contributing to their spread.

Combinatorial gene inactivation of aldehyde dehydrogenases mitigates aldehyde 
oxidation catalyzed by E. coli resting cells.

Butler ND(1), Anderson SR(1), Dickey RM(1), Nain P(1), Kunjapur AM(2).

Aldehydes are attractive chemical targets both as end products in the flavors 
and fragrances industry and as synthetic intermediates due to their propensity 
for C-C bond formation. Here, we identify and address unexpected oxidation of a 
model collection of aromatic aldehydes, including many that originate from 
biomass degradation. When diverse aldehydes are supplemented to E. coli cells 
grown under aerobic conditions, as expected they are either reduced by the 
wild-type MG1655 strain or stabilized by a strain engineered for reduced 
aromatic aldehyde reduction (the E. coli RARE strain). Surprisingly, when these 
same aldehydes are supplemented to resting cell preparations of either E. coli 
strain, under many conditions we observe substantial oxidation. By performing 
combinatorial inactivation of six candidate aldehyde dehydrogenase genes in the 
E. coli genome using multiplexed automatable genome engineering (MAGE), we 
demonstrate that this oxidation can be substantially slowed, with greater than 
50% retention of 6 out of 8 aldehydes when assayed 4 h after their addition. 
Given that our newly engineered strain exhibits reduced oxidation and reduction 
of aromatic aldehydes, we dubbed it the E. coli ROAR strain. We applied the new 
strain to resting cell biocatalysis for two kinds of reactions - the reduction 
of 2-furoic acid to furfural and the condensation of 3-hydroxybenzaldehyde and 
glycine to form a non-standard β-hydroxy-α-amino acid. In each case, we observed 
substantial improvements in product titer 20 h after reaction initiation (9-fold 
and 10-fold, respectively). Moving forward, the use of this strain to generate 
resting cells should allow aldehyde product isolation, further enzymatic 
conversion, or chemical reactivity under cellular contexts that better 
accommodate aldehyde toxicity.

Transforming Cross-Linked Cyclic Dimers of KR-12 into Stable and Potent 
Antimicrobial Drug Leads.

Muhammad T(1), Strömstedt AA(1), Gunasekera S(1), Göransson U(1).

Is it possible to enhance structural stability and biological activity of KR-12, 
a truncated antimicrobial peptide derived from the human host defense peptide 
LL-37? Based on the mapping of essential residues in KR-12, we have designed 
backbone-cyclized dimers, cross-linked via a disulfide bond to improve peptide 
stability, while at the same time improving on-target activity. Circular 
dichroism showed that each of the dimers adopts a primarily alpha-helical 
conformation (55% helical content) when bound to lyso-phosphatidylglycerol 
micelles, indicating that the helical propensity of the parent peptide is 
maintained in the new cross-linked cyclic form. Compared to KR-12, one of the 
cross-linked dimers showed 16-fold more potent antimicrobial activity against 
human pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida 
albicans and 8-fold increased activity against Escherichia coli. Furthermore, 
these peptides retained antimicrobial activity at physiologically relevant 
conditions, including in the presence of salts and in human serum, and with 
selective Gram-negative antibacterial activity in rich growth media. In addition 
to giving further insight into the structure-activity relationship of KR-12, the 
current work demonstrates that by combining peptide stabilization strategies 
(dimerization, backbone cyclization, and cross-linking via a disulfide bond), 
KR-12 can be engineered into a potent antimicrobial peptide drug lead with 
potential utility in a therapeutic context.

Enhancement of activity and thermostability of Aspergillus niger ATCC 10864 
phytase A through rational design.

Dotsenko A(1), Rozhkova A(2), Zorov I(3), Korotkova O(4), Sinitsyn A(3).

Aspergillus niger ATCC 10864 phytase A was produced in Penicillium verruculosum. 
The enzyme was found to have two pH optima of 2.5 and 5.0, as well as a 
T-optimum of 50-55 °C. Two amino acid substitutions, A76M and S265P, were 
designed for improvement in thermostability, and two more, N300K and D363N, were 
designed for improvement in enzyme activity. The most thermostable variant, 
S265P, was characterized by a 3.8-fold increase in time of half-life at 55 °C 
and a 1.2-fold increase in residual activity at 90 °C compared to the wild-type. 
The most active variant, D363N, was 1.7-times more active at 40 °C and retained 
1.3-times higher residual activity at 90 °C compared to the wild-type. The 
obtained results revealed the importance of substitutions with proline in 
α-helixes for the thermostability improvement of phytases. Also, the importance 
of sequence motif 361HDN363 was demonstrated with relevance to values of 
catalytic parameters.

Redox-Responsive Polymer Nanoreactors Based on Methionine Sulfoxide for 
Monitoring Cell Adhesion.

Qiao J(1)(2), Ma Q(1)(3), Li X(1)(4), Qi L(1)(2).

Expanding the category of redox-responsive monomers suitable for enzymolysis 
efficiency regulation and application to living biosystems is a prerequisite to 
complementing the fabrication of stimuli-responsive polymer nanoreactors. 
However, the development of redox-responsive monomers is severely limited by 
chemical oxidation and low biocompatibility. This work presents a protocol for 
overcoming this problem by the self-assembly of redox-responsive polymer 
nanoreactors containing segments of water-soluble methionine sulfoxide residues 
and poly(styrene-co-maleic anhydride-l-methionine), and by immobilizing 
α-l-fucosidase into the nanoreactors. These nanoreactors demonstrate highly 
selective responses to a mild redox triggered by H2O2 from the initial state 
(VO) to an oxidation state (VO1), and are reduced by methionine sulfoxide 
reductase A to mold the VO' state. It resulted in significantly enhanced 
enzymolysis efficiency and maximal reaction rates 8.1-fold (VO) and 23.3-fold 
(VO1) higher than those of the free enzyme. Moreover, cell adhesion was 
evaluated by the highly selective determination of l-fucose on cell surfaces. 
Using a combination of chemical oxidation and enzymatic reduction, this work 
achieves reiterative enzymolysis efficiency regulation of polymer nanoreactors, 
which has great potential for the construction of redox-responsive nanoreactors 
and for monitoring cell adhesion.

Farnesoid X receptor agonist tropifexor attenuates cholestasis in a randomised 
trial in patients with primary biliary cholangitis.

J(14)(15), Koo P(16), Chen J(16), Choudhury S(17), Klickstein LB(18), Badman 
MK(18), Jones D(19).

BACKGROUND & AIMS: The safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the non-bile acid 
farnesoid X receptor agonist tropifexor were evaluated in a phase II, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled study as potential second-line therapy for 
patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) with an inadequate 
ursodeoxycholic acid response.
METHODS: Patients were randomised (2:1) to receive tropifexor (30, 60, 90, or 
150 μg) or matched placebo orally once daily for 28 days, with follow-up on Days 
56 and 84. Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability of tropifexor and 
reduction in levels of γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and other liver biomarkers. 
Other objectives included patient-reported outcome measures using the PBC-40 
quality-of-life (QoL) and visual analogue scale scores and tropifexor 
pharmacokinetics.
RESULTS: Of 61 enrolled patients, 11, 9, 12, and 8 received 30-, 60-, 90-, and 
150-μg tropifexor, respectively, and 21 received placebo; 3 patients 
discontinued treatment because of adverse events (AEs) in the 150-μg tropifexor 
group. Pruritus was the most frequent AE in the study (52.5% [tropifexor] vs. 
28.6% [placebo]), with most events of mild to moderate severity. Decreases seen 
in LDL-, HDL-, and total-cholesterol levels at 60-, 90-, and 150 μg doses 
stabilised after treatment discontinuation. By Day 28, tropifexor caused 26-72% 
reduction in GGT from baseline at 30- to 150-μg doses (p <0.001 at 60-, 90-, and 
150-μg tropifexor vs. placebo). Day 28 QoL scores were comparable between the 
placebo and tropifexor groups. A dose-dependent increase in plasma tropifexor 
concentration was observed, with 5- to 5.55-fold increases in AUC0-8h and Cmax 
between 30- and 150-μg doses.
CONCLUSIONS: Tropifexor showed improvement in cholestatic markers relative to 
placebo, predictable pharmacokinetics, and an acceptable safety-tolerability 
profile, thereby supporting its potential further clinical development for PBC.
LAY SUMMARY: The bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the standard-of-care 
therapy for primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), but approximately 40% of patients 
have an inadequate response to this therapy. Tropifexor is a highly potent 
non-bile acid agonist of the farnesoid X receptor that is under clinical 
development for various chronic liver diseases. In the current study, in 
patients with an inadequate response to UDCA, tropifexor was found to be safe 
and well tolerated, with improved levels of markers of bile duct injury at very 
low (microgram) doses. Itch of mild to moderate severity was observed in all 
groups including placebo but was more frequent at the highest tropifexor dose.
CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov 
(NCT02516605).

Inducible Gut-Specific Carboxylesterase SlCOE030 in Polyphagous Pests of 
Spodoptera litura Conferring Tolerance between Nicotine and Cyantraniliprole.

Li J(1), Lv Y(1), Liu Y(1), Bi R(2), Pan Y(1), Shang Q(1).

Insecticides tolerance in herbivorous arthropods is associated with 
preadaptation to host plant allelochemicals. However, how plant secondary 
metabolites activate detoxifying metabolic genes to develop tolerance remains 
unclear. Herein, the tolerance of Spodoptera litura larvae to cyantraniliprole 
was increased after nicotine exposure. An S. litura α esterase, SlCOE030, was 
predominantly expressed in the midgut and induced after exposure to 
cyantraniliprole, nicotine, and cyantraniliprole plus nicotine. Drosophila 
melanogaster with ectopically overexpressed SlCOE030 enhanced cyantraniliprole 
and nicotine tolerance by 4.91- and 2.12-fold, respectively. Compared to 
UAS-SlCOE030 and Esg-GAL4 lines, the Esg > SlCOE030 line laid more eggs after 
nicotine exposure. SlCOE030 knockdown decreased the sensitivity of 
nicotine-treated S. litura larvae to cyantraniliprole. Metabolism assays 
indicated that recombinant SlCOE030 protein metabolizes cyantraniliprole. 
Homology modeling and molecular docking analysis demonstrated that SlCOE030 
exhibits effective affinities for cyantraniliprole and nicotine. Thus, insect 
CarEs may result in the development of cross-tolerance between synthetic 
insecticides and plant secondary metabolites.

Mechanism of β-hairpin formation in AzoChignolin and Chignolin.

Zschau RL(1), Zacharias M(1).

AzoChignolin is a photoswitchable variant of the mini-protein Chignolin with an 
azobenzene (AMPP) replacing the central loop. AzoChignolin is unfolded with AMPP 
in the trans-isomer. Transition to the cis-isomer causes β-hairpin folding 
similar to Chignolin. The AzoChignolin system is excellently suited for 
comprehensive analysis of folding nucleation kinetics. Utilizing multiple 
long-time MD simulations of AzoChignolin and Chignolin in MeOH and water, we 
estimated Markov models to examine folding kinetics of both peptides. We show 
that while AzoChignolin mimics Chignolin's structure well, the folding kinetics 
are quite different. Not only folding times but also intermediate states differ, 
particularly Chignolin is able to fold in MeOH into an α-helical intermediate 
which is impossible to form in AzoChignolin. The Markov models demonstrate that 
AzoChignolin's kinetics are generally faster, specifically when comparing the 
two main microfolding processes of hydrophobic collapse and turn formation. 
Photoswitchable loops are used frequently to understand the kinetics of 
elementary protein folding nucleation. However, our results indicate that 
intermediates and folding kinetics may differ between natural loops and 
photoswitchable variants.

Measuring Protein Conformation at Aqueous Interfaces with 2D Infrared 
Spectroscopy of Emulsions.

Chatterley AS(1), Golbek TW(1), Weidner T(1).

Determining the secondary and tertiary structures of proteins at aqueous 
interfaces is crucial for understanding their function, but measuring these 
structures selectively at the interface is challenging. Here we demonstrate that 
two-dimensional infrared (2D-IR) spectroscopy of protein stabilized emulsions 
offers a new route to measuring interfacial protein structure with high levels 
of detail. We prepared hexadecane/water oil-in-water emulsions stabilized by 
model LK peptides that are known to fold into either α-helix or β-sheet 
conformations at hydrophobic interfaces and measured 2D-IR spectra in a 
transmission geometry. We saw clear spectral signatures of the peptides folding 
at the interface, with no detectable residue from remaining bulk peptides. Using 
2D spectroscopy gives us access to correlation and dynamics data, which enables 
structural assignment in cases where linear spectroscopy fails. Using the 
emulsions allows one to study interfacial spectra with standard transmission 
geometry spectrometers, bringing the richness of 2D-IR to the interface with no 
additional optical complexity.

Structural insight into the hydrolase and synthase activities of an alkaline 
α-galactosidase from Arabidopsis from complexes with substrate/product.

Chuankhayan P(1), Lee RH(2), Guan HH(1), Lin CC(1), Chen NC(1), Huang YC(1), 
Yoshimura M(1), Nakagawa A(3), Chen CJ(1).

The alkaline α-galactosidase AtAkαGal3 from Arabidopsis thaliana catalyzes the 
hydrolysis of α-D-galactose from galacto-oligosaccharides under alkaline 
conditions. A phylogenetic analysis based on sequence alignment classifies 
AtAkαGal3 as more closely related to the raffinose family of oligosaccharide 
(RFO) synthases than to the acidic α-galactosidases. Here, thin-layer 
chromatography is used to demonstrate that AtAkαGal3 exhibits a dual function 
and is capable of synthesizing stachyose using raffinose, instead of galactinol, 
as the galactose donor. Crystal structures of complexes of AtAkαGal3 and its 
D383A mutant with various substrates and products, including galactose, 
galactinol, raffinose, stachyose and sucrose, are reported as the first 
representative structures of an alkaline α-galactosidase. The structure 
of AtAkαGal3 comprises three domains: an N-terminal domain with 13 antiparallel 
β-strands, a catalytic domain with an (α/β)8-barrel fold and a C-terminal domain 
composed of β-sheets that form two Greek-key motifs. The WW box of the 
N-terminal domain, which comprises the conserved residues FRSK75XW77W78 in the 
RFO synthases, contributes Trp77 and Trp78 to the +1 subsite to contribute to 
the substrate-binding ability together with the (α/β)8 barrel of the catalytic 
domain. The C-terminal domain is presumably involved in structural stability. 
Structures of the D383A mutant in complex with various substrates and products, 
especially the natural substrate/product stachyose, reveal four complete 
subsites (-1 to +3) at the catalytic site. A functional loop (residues 329-352) 
that exists in the alkaline α-galactosidase AtAkαGal3 and possibly in RFO 
synthases, but not in acidic α-galactosidases, stabilizes the stachyose at the 
+2 and +3 subsites and extends the catalytic pocket for the transferase 
mechanism. Considering the similarities in amino-acid sequence, catalytic domain 
and activity between alkaline α-galactosidases and RFO synthases, the structure 
of AtAkαGal3 might also serve a model for the study of RFO synthases, structures 
of which are lacking.

compare two optical configurations where the hologram plane is located either 
just outside the particle suspension or in the middle of the suspension. In both 
cases, we record two axially separated holograms using two cameras and 
subsequently adopt an iterative phase retrieval approach to solve the virtual 
image problem. We measure the settling motions of 2 µm spheres in a 2 mm thick 
sample containing 300 to 1500p a r t i c l e s/m m 3. We show that the optical 
setup where the hologram plane is located in the middle of the sample provides 
superior tracking results compared to the other, including higher accuracy in 
the measurement of particle displacement and longer particle trajectories. The 
accuracy of particle displacement increases by a maximum of 18%, and the 
trajectory length increases by a maximum of 16%. This superior outcome is due to 
the less overlapping of the diffraction patterns on the holograms when the 
separation distance between particles and the hologram plane is minimized.

Characterisation of Elevenin-Vc1 from the Venom of Conus victoriae: A Structural 
Analogue of α-Conotoxins.

A(3), Robinson AJ(3), Safavi-Hemami H(4), Adams DJ(2), Norton RS(1).

Elevenins are peptides found in a range of organisms, including arthropods, 
annelids, nematodes, and molluscs. They consist of 17 to 19 amino acid residues 
with a single conserved disulfide bond. The subject of this study, elevenin-Vc1, 
was first identified in the venom of the cone snail Conus victoriae (Gen. Comp. 
Endocrinol. 2017, 244, 11-18). Although numerous elevenin sequences have been 
reported, their physiological function is unclear, and no structural information 
is available. Upon intracranial injection in mice, elevenin-Vc1 induced 
hyperactivity at doses of 5 or 10 nmol. The structure of elevenin-Vc1, 
determined using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, consists of a short 
helix and a bend region stabilised by the single disulfide bond. The 
elevenin-Vc1 structural fold is similar to that of α-conotoxins such as α-RgIA 
and α-ImI, which are also found in the venoms of cone snails and are antagonists 
at specific subtypes of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). In an 
attempt to mimic the functional motif, Asp-Pro-Arg, of α-RgIA and α-ImI, we 
synthesised an analogue, designated elevenin-Vc1-DPR. However, neither 
elevenin-Vc1 nor the analogue was active at six different human nAChR subtypes 
(α1β1εδ, α3β2, α3β4, α4β2, α7, and α9α10) at 1 µM concentrations.

Inhibitory activity of soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) Cell Culture Extract on 
tyrosinase activity and melanin formation in alpha-melanocyte stimulating 
Hormone-Induced B16-F10 melanoma cells.

Bodurlar Y(1), Caliskan M(2).

BACKGROUND: Hyperpigmentation, which causes excessive melanin synthesis and 
accumulation, is an important issue in the cosmetic industry. Since compounds 
developed against hyperpigmentation often come with side effects such as skin 
irritation and contact dermatitis, new studies focus on the use of natural 
agents that have no side effects.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, it was found that the effects of soybean 
cell culture extract (SCE) on alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) 
induced melanogenesis in B16-F10 murine melanoma cells. The cells were incubated 
with SCE for 48 h after treatment with α‑MSH for 24 h to analysis the melanin 
content, cellular tyrosinase activity, and gene and protein expression. SCE at 
1 mg/mL decreased melanin content and tyrosinase activity by 34% and 24%, 
respectively, compared to the α-MSH-treated group, which did not decrease cell 
viability. In addition, SCE (1 mg/mL) downregulated the expression of tyrosinase 
(TYR), tyrosinase-related protein (TRP)-1, tyrosinase-related protein (TRP)-2, 
and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) genes 1.5-, 1.5-, 2-, 
and 2-fold, respectively. Furthermore, SCE inhibited the expression of TYR, 
TRP1, and TRP2 by decreasing the expression of MITF, as shown in a western blot 
assay.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that SCE reveals dose-dependent inhibition of 
melanin synthesis through the suppression of tyrosinase activity as well as 
molecular levels of TYR, TRP1, TRP2, and MITF in B16-F10 murine melanoma cells. 
Therefore, SCE has the potential to be an effective and natural skin-whitening 
agent for application in the cosmetic industry.

Fusion of Oligopeptide to the C Terminus of α-Glucuronidase from Thermotoga 
maritima Improves the Catalytic Efficiency for Hemicellulose Biotransformation.

Zhao H(1), Xue Y(2), Xue M(1), Xie F(1), Li Y(1), Ding Z(1).

Fusion protein combined the oligopeptide (HQAFFHA) with the C terminus of 
α-glucuronidase from Thermotoga maritima was produced in E. coli and purified 
for characterization and applications of glucuronic and glucaric acid 
production. The fusion protein with oligopeptide exhibited a 2.97-fold higher 
specific activity than individual protein. Their catalytic efficiency kcat/Km 
and kcat increased from 469.3 ± 2.6 s-1 (g mL-1)-1 and 62.4 ± 0.9 s-1 to 
2209.5 ± 26.3 s-1 (g mL-1)-1 and 293.9 ± 4.9 s-1, respectively. Fusion protein 
had similar temperature and pH profiles to those without oligopeptide, but the 
thermal stability decreases and the pH stability shifts to alkaline. Using beech 
xylan hydrolysate as a substrate, the glucuronic acid yield of fusion enzyme 
increased by 9.94% compared with its parent at 65 °C pH 8.5 for 10 h, and can 
hydrolyze corn cob xylan with xylanase to obtain glucuronic acid, and can be 
combined with uronate dehydrogenase to obtain high-added value glucaric acid. 
Homologous modeling analysis revealed the factors contributing to the high 
catalytic efficiency of fusion enzyme. These results show that the peptide 
fusion strategy described here may be useful for improving the catalytic 
efficiency and stability of other industrial enzymes, and has great potential 
for producing high value-added products from agricultural waste.

New pyrrole derivatives as DNA gyrase and 14α-demethylase inhibitors: Design, 
synthesis, antimicrobial evaluation, and molecular docking.

Hilmy KMH(1), Kishk FNM(1), Shahen EBA(2), Sobh EA(3), Hawata MA(1).

An efficient one-pot reaction utilizing readily available chemical reagents was 
used to prepare novel 2-amino-1,5-diaryl-1H-pyrrole-3-carbonitrile derivatives 
and the structures of these compounds were validated by spectroscopic data and 
elemental analyses. All the synthetic compounds were evaluated for their 
antimicrobial activities (MZI assay). The tested compounds proved high 
activities on Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive bacteria) and Candida 
albicans (Pathogenic fungi). However, they did not show any activity on 
Escherichia coli (Gram-negative bacteria). The most effective compounds in MZI 
assay 7c, 9a, 9b, 11a, and 11b were selected to determine their MIC on S. aureus 
and C. albicans. Furthermore, DNA gyrase and 14-α demethylase inhibitory assays 
were performed to study the inhibitory activities of 7c, 9a, 9b, 11a, and 11b. 
The results illustrated that compound 9b was the most DNA gyrase inhibitor (IC50 
of 0.0236 ± 0.45 µM, which was 1.3- fold higher than gentamicin reference IC50 
values of 0.0323 ± 0.81 µM). In addition, compound 9b demonstrated the highest 
14-α demethylase inhibitory effect with IC50 of 0.0013 ± 0.02 µM, compared to 
ketoconazole (IC50 of 0.0008 ± 0.03 µM) and fluconazole (IC50 of 
0.00073 ± 0.01 µM), as antifungal reference drugs. Lastly, docking studies were 
performed to rationalize the dual inhibitory activities of the highly active 
compounds on both DNA gyrase and 14-α demethylase enzymes.

Rapid and sensitive immunoassay for alpha-fetoprotein in serum by fabricating 
primary antibody-enzyme complexes using protein self-assembly.

Liu Z(1), Liu X(1), Pei H(2), Bao K(1), Su B(1), Cao H(1), Wu L(1), Chen 
Q(1)(3).

Primary antibody-enzyme complexes (PAECs) are ideal immunosensing elements that 
simplify the immunoassay process and improve the uniformity of results due to 
their ability to both recognize antigens and catalyze substrates. However, the 
conventional fabrication methods of PAECs, such as direct gene fusion 
expression, chemical conjugation, enzymatic conjugation, etc., have low 
efficiency, poor reliability, and other defects, which limit the widespread 
application of PAECs. Therefore, we developed a convenient method for the 
fabrication of homogeneous multivalent PAECs using protein self-assembly and 
validated it using anti-alpha-fetoprotein nanobody (A1) and alkaline phosphatase 
(ALP) as models. Heptavalent PAECs showed a 4-fold enhancement in enzymatic 
catalytic activity compared to monovalent PAECs. Further, to verify the 
application of developed heptavalent PAECs in immunoassay, heptavalent PAECs 
were used as bifunctional probes to construct a double-antibody sandwich ELISA 
to detect AFP. The detection limit of the developed heptavalent PAEC-based ELISA 
is 0.69 ng mL-1, which is about 3 times higher than that of monovalent PAECs, 
and the whole detection process can be completed within 3 hours. In short, the 
proposed protein self-assembling method is a promising technology for developing 
high-performance heptavalent PACEs, which can simplify the detection process and 
improve detection sensitivity in various immunoassays.

Discovery and Structural and Functional Characterization of a Novel 
A-Superfamily Conotoxin Targeting α9α10 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor.

Huang Q(1)(2), Chu X(1)(3), Zhang H(4), Yu S(1), Zhang L(1), Zhang X(2), Yu 
R(3), Guo C(4), Dai Q(1).

Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are pentameric ligand-gated ion 
channels widely distributed in the central peripheral nervous system and muscles 
which participate in rapid synaptic transmission. The α9α10 nAChR is an 
acetylcholine receptor subtype and is involved in chronic pain. In the present 
study, a new A-superfamily conotoxin Bt14.12 cloned from Conus betulinus was 
found to selectively inhibit α9α10 nAChRs with an IC50 of 62.3 nM. Unlike 
α-conotoxins and other A-superfamily conotoxins, Bt14.12 contains a four Cys 
(C-C-C-C) framework with a unique disulfide bond connection "C1-C4, C2-C3". The 
structure-activity studies of Bt14.12 demonstrate that all amino acid residues 
contribute to its potency. Interestingly, mutation experiments show that the 
deletion of Asp2 or the addition of three Arg residues at the N-terminus of 
Bt14.12 significantly enhances its inhibitory activity (IC50 is 21.9 nM or 12.7 
nM, respectively) by 2- or 4-fold compared to the wild-type Bt14.12. The NMR 
structure of Bt14.12 shows that it contains α-helix- and β-turn-like elements, 
and further computational modelings of the interaction between Bt14.12 and the 
α9α10 nAChR demonstrate that Bt14.12 possesses a distinctive mode of action and 
displays a different structure-activity relationship from known α9α10 nAChR 
targeting α-conotoxins. Our findings provide a novel conotoxin that potently 
targets α9α10 nAChRs and a new motif for designing potent inhibitors against 
α9α10 nAChRs.

Glycoside hydrolase from the GH76 family indicates that marine Salegentibacter 
sp. Hel_I_6 consumes alpha-mannan from fungi.

J(2), Hoang KLM(2)(3), Klassen L(4), Abbott DW(4), Seeberger PH(2), Amann RI(1),

Microbial glycan degradation is essential to global carbon cycling. The marine 
bacterium Salegentibacter sp. Hel_I_6 (Bacteroidota) isolated from seawater off 
Helgoland island (North Sea) contains an α-mannan inducible gene cluster with a 
GH76 family endo-α-1,6-mannanase (ShGH76). This cluster is related to genetic 
loci employed by human gut bacteria to digest fungal α-mannan. Metagenomes from 
the Hel_I_6 isolation site revealed increasing GH76 gene frequencies in 
free-living bacteria during microalgae blooms, suggesting degradation of 
α-1,6-mannans from fungi. Recombinant ShGH76 protein activity assays with yeast 
α-mannan and synthetic oligomannans showed endo-α-1,6-mannanase activity. 
Resolved structures of apo-ShGH76 (2.0 Å) and of mutants co-crystalized with 
fungal mannan-mimicking α-1,6-mannotetrose (1.90 Å) and α-1,6-mannotriose 
(1.47 Å) retained the canonical (α/α)6 fold, despite low identities with 
sequences of known GH76 structures (GH76s from gut bacteria: <27%). The apo-form 
active site differed from those known from gut bacteria, and co-crystallizations 
revealed a kinked oligomannan conformation. Co-crystallizations also revealed 
precise molecular-scale interactions of ShGH76 with fungal mannan-mimicking 
oligomannans, indicating adaptation to this particular type of substrate. Our 
data hence suggest presence of yet unknown fungal α-1,6-mannans in marine 
ecosystems, in particular during microalgal blooms.

Epigenetic Repression of RUNX2 and OSX Promoters Controls the Nonmineralized 
State of the Periodontal Ligament.

Gopinathan G(1), Luan X(1), Diekwisch TGH(2).

The nonmineralized state of the mammalian periodontal ligament is one of the 
hallmarks of vertebrate evolution as it provides resilient and nontraumatic 
tooth anchorage for effective predation. Here we sought to determine how the 
chromatin state of key mineralization gene promoters contributes to the 
nonmineralized periodontal ligament in the midst of fully mineralized alveolar 
bone and cementum anchor tissues. In developing mouse periodontal tissues, RUNX2 
was localized to alveolar bone-lining cells, while OSX was localized throughout 
the periodontal ligament's soft tissue. Matching RT-PCR amplification data and 
western blot comparisons demonstrated that the expression of RUNX2 and OSX bone 
mineralization transcription factors was at least 2.5-fold elevated in alveolar 
bone osteoblasts versus periodontal ligament fibroblasts. ChIP enrichment data 
along the RUNX2 and OSX promoters revealed increased H3K4me3 marks in alveolar 
bone osteoblasts, while H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 marks were elevated in periodontal 
ligament fibroblasts. In support of an epigenetic mechanism responsible for the 
inhibition of mineralization gene expression in periodontal progenitors, histone 
methylation inhibitors DZNep and Chaetocin reactivated RUNX2 and OSX expression 
in periodontal progenitors and increased alkaline phosphatase and Alizarin Red, 
while the in vivo application of DZNep in rat maxillae resulted in aberrant 
mineralization in the periodontal ligament and a narrowing of the nonmineralized 
periodontal space. Together, these studies demonstrate that the nonmineralized 
state of the mammalian periodontal ligament is controlled by an epigenetic 
regulation of the RUNX2 and OSX key mineralization gene promoters.

therapy of Salmonella.

Targeted antibiotic delivery system would be an ideal solution for the treatment 
of enteropathogenic infections since it avoids the excessive usage of 
antibiotics clinically, which may lead to threat on public health and food 
safety. Salmonella spp. are Enteropathogens, but they are also robust H2S 
producers in the intestinal tracts of hosts. To this end, the PEGylated poly (α 
lipoic acid) (PEG-PALA) copolymer nanoparticles with hydrophilic exterior and 
hydrophobic interior were designated in this study to encapsulate the 
antibiotics and release them in response to H2S produced by Salmonella spp. The 
PEG-PALA nanoparticles demonstrated excellent stability in vitro and 
biocompatibility toward mammalian Caco-2 and 293 T cells. The release of 
ciprofloxacin from PEG-PALA nanoparticle was only 25.44 ± 0.57% and 
26.98 ± 1.93% (w/w) in simulated gastric fluid (SGF) and simulated intestinal 
fluid (SIF) solutions without H2S stimulation. However, the release amounts of 
ciprofloxacin were up to 73.68 ± 1.63% (w/w) in the presence of 1 mM Na2S as H2S 
source. In the mouse infection model, PEG-PALA nanoparticles encapsulated with 
ciprofloxacin (PEG-PALA@CIP) reduced the Salmonella colonization in the heart, 
liver, spleen, lung, cecum, and faeces, prolonged ciprofloxacin persistence in 
the intestine while reducing its absorption into the blood. More importantly, 
these nanoparticles reduced 3.4-fold of Enterobacteriaceae levels and increased 
1.5-fold of the Lactobacillaceae levels compared with the drug administered in 
the free form. Moreover, these nanoparticles resulted in only minimal signs of 
intestinal tract inflammation. The H2S-responsive antibiotic delivery systems 
reported in this study demonstrating a variety of advantages including protected 
the drug from deactivation by gastric and intestinal fluids, maintained a high 
concentration in the intestinal tract and maximally kept the gut microbiota 
homeostasis. As such, this targeted antibiotic delivery systems are for the 
encapsulation of antibiotics to target specific enteropathogens.

IL-34 involves in host immunity regulated carcinogenesis. Alpha-fetoprotein 
(AFP) is related to the development of HCC. We explored if combination of IL-34 
and APF could improve the diagnostic value in HBV related hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HBV-HCC). Serum was obtained from HBV patients or healthy control. 
Liver tissue was obtained from liver biopsy in CHB, HBV related cirrhosis 
patients or curative resection in HBV-HCC patients. Serum IL-34 and MCSF, or 
intrahepatic IL-34, MCSF and CD68+ tumor associate macrophages (TAMs) were 
determined using ELISA or immunohistochemistry. Serum IL-34 was 1.7, 1.3 or 
2.3-fold higher in HBV-HCC than that of CHB, HBV related cirrhosis or healthy 
control, which was inhibited following trans-hepatic arterial chemoembolization 
(TACE) in HBV-HCC patients. Intra-hepatic IL-34 was higher in HBV-HCC than that 
of the other three groups. Intra-hepatic IL-34 was associated with high HBV-DNA, 
HBeAg-, poor differentiation and small tumor size of HBV-HCC patients. 
Intra-hepatic TAMs in HBV-HCC were increased 1.7 or 1.3-fold, compared to that 
from CHB or HBV-cirrhosis patients. Intra-hepatic TAMs were associated with high 
HBV-DNA, high tumor differentiation, small tumor size, abnormal AFP and more 
tumor number. AFP plus serum IL-34, showed the highest AUC (0.837) with 
sensitivity (0.632) and highest specificity (0.931), suggesting that AFP plus 
IL-34 enhances the reliability for prediction of the development of HBV-HCC 
among CHB patients. Circulating and intra-hepatic IL-34 was upregulated 
gradually in HBV disease progression from CHB, cirrhosis and HCC. IL-34 may be 
used as a diagnostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for the 
management of HBV-HCC.

Structural characterization of SARS-CoV-2 dimeric ORF9b reveals potential 
fold-switching trigger mechanism.

The constant emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) variants indicates the evolution and adaptation of the virus. 
Enhanced innate immune evasion through increased expression of viral antagonist 
proteins, including ORF9b, contributes to the improved transmission of the Alpha 
variant; hence, more attention should be paid to these viral proteins. ORF9b is 
an accessory protein that suppresses innate immunity via a monomer conformation 
by binding to Tom70. Here, we solved the dimeric structure of SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b 
with a long hydrophobic tunnel containing a lipid molecule that is crucial for 
the dimeric conformation and determined the specific lipid ligands as 
monoglycerides by conducting a liquid chromatography with tandem mass 
spectrometry analysis, suggesting an important role in the viral life cycle. 
Notably, a long intertwined loop accessible for host factor binding was observed 
in the structure. Eight phosphorylated residues in ORF9b were identified, and 
residues S50 and S53 were found to contribute to the stabilization of dimeric 
ORF9b. Additionally, we proposed a model of multifunctional ORF9b with a 
distinct conformation, suggesting that ORF9b is a fold-switching protein, while 
both lipids and phosphorylation contribute to the switching. Specifically, the 
ORF9b monomer interacts with Tom70 to suppress the innate immune response, 
whereas the ORF9b dimer binds to the membrane involving mature virion assembly. 
Our results provide a better understanding of the multiple functions of ORF9b.

Lanthanide-Nucleotide Coordination Nanoparticles for STING Activation.

Luo Z(1), Liang X(2), He T(2), Qin X(1), Li X(2), Li Y(2), Li L(2), Loh XJ(3), 
Gong C(2), Liu X(1)(3)(4).

Activation of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is essential for 
blocking viral infections and eliciting antitumor immune responses. Local 
injection of synthetic STING agonists, such as 2'3'-cGAMP [cGAMP = cyclic 
5'-guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-adenosine monophosphate (AMP)], is a promising 
approach to enhance antiviral functions and cancer immunotherapy. However, the 
application of such agonists has been hindered by complicated synthetic 
procedures, high doses, and unsatisfactory systemic immune responses. Herein, we 
report the design and synthesis of a series of 2'3'-cGAMP surrogates in 
nanoparticle formulations formed by reactions of AMP, GMP, and coordinating 
lanthanides. These nanoparticles can stimulate the type-I interferon (IFN) 
response in both mouse macrophages and human monocytes. We further demonstrate 
that the use of europium-based nanoparticles as STING-targeted adjuvants 
significantly promotes the maturation of mouse bone-marrow-derived dendritic 
cells and major histocompatibility complex class I antigen presentation. Dynamic 
molecular docking analysis revealed that these nanoparticles bind with high 
affinity to mouse STING and human STING. Compared with soluble ovalbumin (OVA), 
subcutaneously immunized europium-based nanovaccines exhibit significantly 
increased production of primary and secondary anti-OVA antibodies (∼180-fold) in 
serum, as well as IL-5 (∼28-fold), IFN-γ (∼27-fold), and IFN-α/β (∼4-fold) in 
splenocytes ex vivo. Compared with the 2'3'-cGAMP/OVA formulation, subcutaneous 
administration of nanovaccines significantly inhibits B16F10-OVA tumor growth 
and prolongs the survival of tumor-bearing mice in both therapeutic and 
protective models. Given the rich supramolecular chemistry with lanthanides, 
this work will enable a readily accessible platform for potent humoral and 
cellular immunity while opening new avenues for cost-effective, highly efficient 
therapeutic delivery of STING agonists.

Understanding a protein fold: The physics, chemistry, and biology of α-helical 
coiled coils.

Woolfson DN(1).

Protein science is being transformed by powerful computational methods for 
structure prediction and design: AlphaFold2 can predict many natural protein 
structures from sequence, and other AI methods are enabling the de novo design 
of new structures. This raises a question: how much do we understand the 
underlying sequence-to-structure/function relationships being captured by these 
methods? This perspective presents our current understanding of one class of 
protein assembly, the α-helical coiled coils. At first sight, these are 
straightforward: sequence repeats of hydrophobic (h) and polar (p) residues, 
(hpphppp)n, direct the folding and assembly of amphipathic α helices into 
bundles. However, many different bundles are possible: they can have two or more 
helices (different oligomers); the helices can have parallel, antiparallel, or 
mixed arrangements (different topologies); and the helical sequences can be the 
same (homomers) or different (heteromers). Thus, sequence-to-structure 
relationships must be present within the hpphppp repeats to distinguish these 
states. I discuss the current understanding of this problem at three levels: 
first, physics gives a parametric framework to generate the many possible 
coiled-coil backbone structures. Second, chemistry provides a means to explore 
and deliver sequence-to-structure relationships. Third, biology shows how coiled 
coils are adapted and functionalized in nature, inspiring applications of coiled 
coils in synthetic biology. I argue that the chemistry is largely understood; 
the physics is partly solved, though the considerable challenge of predicting 
even relative stabilities of different coiled-coil states remains; but there is 
much more to explore in the biology and synthetic biology of coiled coils.

BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) and its progression are thought to be 
caused and driven by misfolding of α-synuclein (ASYN). UCB0599 is an oral, 
small-molecule inhibitor of ASYN misfolding, aimed at slowing disease 
progression.
OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate safety/tolerability and pharmacokinetics 
(PK) of single and multiple doses of UCB0599.
METHODS: Safety/tolerability and PK of single and multiple doses of UCB0599 and 
its metabolites were investigated in two phase 1 studies in healthy participants 
(HPs), where food effect and possible interaction with itraconazole (ITZ) were 
assessed (UP0030 [randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation, crossover 
study, N = 65] and UP0078 [open-label study, N = 22]). Safety/tolerability and 
multi-dose PK of UCB0599 were subsequently investigated in a phase 1b 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of participants with PD 
(UP0077 [NCT04875962], N = 31).
RESULTS: Across all studies, UCB0599 displayed rapid absorption with linear, 
time-independent PK properties; PK of multiple doses of UCB0599 were predictable 
from single-dose exposures. No notable food-effect was observed; 
co-administration with ITZ affected UCB0599 disposition (maximum plasma 
concentration and area under the curve increased ~1.3- and ~2 to 3-fold, 
respectively) however, this did not impact the safety profile. Hypersensitivity 
reactions were reported in UP0030 (n = 2) and UP0077 (n = 2). Treatment-related 
adverse events occurred in 43% (UCB0599), and 30% (placebo) of participants with 
PD were predominantly mild-to-moderate in intensity and were not dose related.
CONCLUSIONS: Seventy-three HPs and 21 participants with PD received UCB0599 
doses; an acceptable safety/tolerability profile and predictable PK support 
continued development of UCB0599 for the slowing of PD progression. A phase 2 
study in early-stage PD is underway (NCT04658186). © 2022 UCB Pharma. Movement

Sex differences in glutamate AMPA receptor subunits mRNA with fast gating 
kinetics in the mouse cochlea.

Lozier NR(1), Muscio S(1), Pal I(1), Cai HM(1), Rubio ME(1)(2)(3).

Evidence shows that females have increased supra-threshold peripheral auditory 
processing compared to males. This is indicated by larger auditory brainstem 
responses (ABR) wave I amplitude, which measures afferent spiral ganglion neuron 
(SGN)-auditory nerve synchrony. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of 
this sex difference are mostly unknown. We sought to elucidate sex differences 
in ABR wave I amplitude by examining molecular markers known to affect synaptic 
transmission kinetics. Alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid 
receptors (AMPARs) mediate fast excitatory transmission in mature SGN afferent 
synapses. Each AMPAR channel is a tetramer composed of GluA2, 3, and 4 subunits 
(Gria2, 3, and 4 genes), and those lacking GluA2 subunits have larger currents, 
are calcium-permeable, and have faster gating kinetics. Moreover, alternatively 
spliced flip and flop isoforms of each AMPAR subunit affect channel kinetics, 
having faster kinetics those AMPARs containing Gria3 and Gria4 flop isoforms. We 
hypothesized that SGNs of females have more fast-gating AMPAR subunit mRNA than 
males, which could contribute to more temporally precise synaptic transmission 
and increased SGN synchrony. Our data show that the index of Gria3 relative to 
Gria2 transcripts on SGN was higher in females than males (females: 48%; males: 
43%), suggesting that females have more SGNs with higher Gria3 mRNA relative to 
Gria2. Analysis of the relative abundance of the flip and flop alternatively 
spliced isoforms showed that females have a 2-fold increase in fast-gating Gria3 
flop mRNA, while males have more slow-gating (2.5-fold) of the flip. We propose 
that Gria3 may in part mediate greater SGN synchrony in females. Significance 
Statement: Females of multiple vertebrate species, including fish and mammals, 
have been reported to have enhanced sound-evoked synchrony of afferents in the 
auditory nerve. However, the underlying molecular mediators of this physiologic 
sex difference are unknown. Elucidating potential molecular mechanisms related 
to sex differences in auditory processing is important for maintaining healthy 
ears and developing potential treatments for hearing loss in both sexes. This 
study found that females have a 2-fold increase in Gria3 flop mRNA, a 
fast-gating AMPA-type glutamate receptor subunit. This difference may contribute 
to greater neural synchrony in the auditory nerve of female mice compared to 
males, and this sex difference may be conserved in all vertebrates.

Endothelial Cell Markers Are Inferior to Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells Markers in 
Staining Vasa Vasorum and Are Non-Specific for Distinct Endothelial Cell 
Lineages in Clinical Samples.

Markova V(1), Bogdanov L(1), Velikanova E(1), Kanonykina A(1), Frolov A(1), 
Shishkova D(1), Lazebnaya A(1), Kutikhin A(1).

Current techniques for the detection of vasa vasorum (VV) in vascular pathology 
include staining for endothelial cell (EC) markers such as CD31 or VE-cadherin. 
However, this approach does not permit an objective assessment of vascular 
geometry upon vasospasm and the clinical relevance of endothelial specification 
markers found in developmental biology studies remains unclear. Here, we 
performed a combined immunostaining of rat abdominal aorta (rAA) and human 
saphenous vein (hSV) for various EC or vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) 
markers and found that the latter (e.g., alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) or 
smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC)) ensure a several-fold higher 
signal-to-noise ratio irrespective of the primary antibody origin, fluorophore, 
or VV type (arterioles, venules, or capillaries). Further, α-SMA or SM-MHC 
staining allowed unbiased evaluation of the VV area under vasospasm. Screening 
of the molecular markers of endothelial heterogeneity (mechanosensitive 
transcription factors KLF2 and KLF4, arterial transcription factors HES1, HEY1, 
and ERG, venous transcription factor NR2F2, and venous/lymphatic markers PROX1, 
LYVE1, VEGFR3, and NRP2) have not revealed specific markers of any lineage in 
hSV (although KLF2 and PROX1 were restricted to venous endothelium in rAA), 
suggesting the need in high-throughput searches for the clinically relevant 
signatures of arterial, venous, lymphatic, or capillary differentiation.

A stimulator of interferon gene (CgSTING) involved in antimicrobial immune 
response of oyster Crassostrea gigas.

Li Y(1), Qiao X(1), Hou L(1), Liu X(1), Li Q(1), Jin Y(1), Li Y(1), Wang L(2), 
Song L(3).

The stimulator of interferon gene (STING), an intracellular sensor of cyclic 
dinucleotides, is critical to the innate immune response, especially the 
induction of type I interferon (IFN) during pathogenic infection. A STING 
homologue (CgSTING) regulating the expression of IFN-like protein (CgIFNLP) was 
previously identified in the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, and its 
involvement in antibacterial immunity was further investigated in the present 
study. The mRNA transcripts of CgSTING were ubiquitously detected in all the 
three subpopulations of haemocytes with the highest expression in 
semi-granulocytes. After the stimulation with Vibrio splendidus, the mRNA 
expression of CgSTING in haemocytes was significantly up-regulated and peaked at 
72 h, which was 12.91-fold of that in control group (p < 0.01). The CgSTING 
protein was mainly located in the cytoplasm of haemocytes. After the expression 
of CgSTING was knocked down (0.12-fold of that in control group, p < 0.05) by 
RNAi, the mRNA expression levels of interleukin17-1 (CgIL17-1), interleukin17-3 
(CgIL17-3), interleukin17-4 (CgIL17-4), defensins (Cgdefh1, Cgdefh2), big 
defensin (CgBigDef1), interferon-like protein (CgIFNLP), tumor necrosis factor 
(CgTNF) and nuclear factor-κB (CgRel) all decreased significantly at 12 h after 
V. splendidus stimulation, which was 0.12-fold-0.72-fold (p < 0.05) of that in 
control group, respectively. The positive signals of CgRel were observed in the 
haemocyte nucleus after V. splendidus stimulation. The nuclear translocation of 
CgRel was suppressed in CgSTING-RNAi oysters, and the green signals of CgRel 
were mainly observed in the haemocyte cytoplasm after V. splendidus stimulation. 
Furthermore, the number of V. splendidus in the haemolymph of CgSTING-RNAi 
oysters increased significantly, which was 26.78-fold (p < 0.01) of that in the 
control group at 12 h after V. splendidus stimulation. These results indicated 
that CgSTING played important role in the immune defense against bacterial 
infection by inducing the expressions of cytokines and defensins.

Urine Cell Transcriptomes Implicate Specific Renal Inflammatory Pathways 
Associated With Difficult-to-Control Hypertension.

Umanath K(1)(2)(3), She R(4)(5), Hassett C(1), Adrianto I(4)(5), Levin AM(4)(5), 
Savickas G(6), Yee J(1)(2), Ortiz P(6)(7).

Background The renal mechanisms involved in the maintenance of human 
hypertension and resistance to treatment are not well understood. Animal studies 
suggest that chronic renal inflammation contributes to hypertension. We studied 
cells shed in first-morning urine samples from individuals who were hypertensive 
who exhibited difficult-to-control blood pressure (BP). We performed bulk RNA 
sequencing of these shed cells to develop transcriptome-wide associations with 
BP. We also analyzed nephron-specific genes and used an unbiased bioinformatic 
approach to find signaling pathways activated in difficult-to-control 
hypertension. Methods and Results Participants who completed the SPRINT 
(Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) at a single trial site were 
recruited, and cells shed in first-morning urine samples collected. A total of 
47 participants were divided into 2 groups based on hypertension control. The 
BP-difficult group (n=29) had systolic BP>140 mm Hg, >120 mm Hg after intensive 
treatment for hypertension, or required more than the median number of 
antihypertensive drugs used in SPRINT. The easy-to-control BP group (n=18) 
comprised the remainder of the participants. A total of 60 differentially 
expressed genes were identified with a >2-fold change in the BP-difficult group. 
In BP-difficult participants, 2 of the most upregulated genes were associated 
with inflammation: Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha Induced Protien 6 (fold change, 
7.76; P=0.006) and Serpin Family B Member 9 (fold change, 5.10; P=0.007). 
Biological pathway analysis revealed an overrepresentation of inflammatory 
networks, including interferon signaling, granulocyte adhesion and diapedesis, 
and Janus Kinase family kinases in the BP-difficult group (P<0.001). Conclusions 
We conclude that transcriptomes from cells shed in first-morning urine identify 
a gene expression profile in difficult-to-control hypertension that associates 
with renal inflammation.

Neuroprotective Effects of Nicotinamide against MPTP-Induced Parkinson's Disease 
in Mice: Impact on Oxidative Stress, Neuroinflammation, Nrf2/HO-1 and TLR4 
Signaling Pathways.

Rehman IU(1), Khan A(1), Ahmad R(1), Choe K(1)(2), Park HY(2)(3), Lee HJ(1), 
Atiq A(1), Park J(1), Hahm JR(4), Kim MO(1)(5).

Nicotinamide (NAM) is the amide form of niacin and an important precursor of 
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), which is needed for energy metabolism 
and cellular functions. Additionally, it has shown neuroprotective properties in 
several neurodegenerative diseases. Herein, we sought to investigate the 
potential protective mechanisms of NAM in an intraperitoneal (i.p) 
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced Parkinson's disease 
(PD) mouse model (wild-type mice (C57BL/6N), eight weeks old, average body 
weight 25-30 g). The study had four groups (n = 10 per group): control, MPTP (30 
mg/kg i.p. for 5 days), MPTP treated with NAM (500 mg/kg, i.p for 10 days) and 
control treated with NAM. Our study showed that MPTP increased the expression of 
α-synuclein 2.5-fold, decreased tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) 0.5-fold and dopamine 
transporters (DAT) levels up to 0.5-fold in the striatum and substantia nigra 
pars compacta (SNpc), and impaired motor function. However, NAM treatment 
significantly reversed these PD-like pathologies. Furthermore, NAM treatment 
reduced oxidative stress by increasing the expression of nuclear factor 
erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) between 0.5- and 
1.0-fold. Lastly, NAM treatment regulated neuroinflammation by reducing 
Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4), phosphorylated nuclear factor-κB, tumor (p-NFκB), 
and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) levels by 0.5- to 2-fold in the PD mouse brain. 
Overall, these findings suggest that NAM exhibits neuroprotective properties and 
may be an effective therapeutic agent for PD.

HNT(2)(3), Tuyen NV(2)(3), Gatilov Y(4), Csuk R(5), Serbian I(5), Hoenke S(5).

The chalcone derivatives of 20-oxo-lupanes have been synthesised and screened 
for some types of biological activity. Ozonolysis of lupanes afforded 
20-oxo-derivatives with the following condensation using different aromatic 
aldehydes by Claisen‒Schmidt reaction to the target compounds. The E 
configuration of 19-[3-(pyridin-3-yl)-prop-2-en-1-one]-fragment was established 
by X-ray analysis. Screening of cytotoxic activity against NCI-60 cancer cell 
line panel revealed, that messagenin derivative 9 has the highest activity with 
GI50 value ranged from 0.304 to 0.804 μM. A colorimetric SRB assay revealed for 
the 2,30-bis-furfurylidene derivative 11 and 
30-bromo-20-oxo-29-nor-3,28-diacetoxy-betulin 16 cytotoxic activity against 
breast carcinoma MCF-7 and ovarian carcinoma A2780 cell lines. Compounds 11 and 
13 acted also as inhibitors of the enzyme α-glucosidase (from S. saccharomyces) 
with IC50 values of 1.76 μM and 3.3 μM thus being 97- and 52-fold more active 
than standard acarbose. Antiviral potency of compounds 12 and 14 against HCMV, 
HSV-1 and HPV is also discussed.[Formula: see text].

New IMB16-4 Hot-Melt Extrusion Preparation Improved Oral Bioavailability and 
Enhanced Anti-Cholestatic Effect on Rats.

Li Y(1)(2), Tian C(1)(2), Song X(3), Du M(4), Zhang G(5), Liu H(2).

BACKGROUND: Cholestasis is challenging to treat due to lacked effective drugs. 
N-(3,4,5-trichlorophenyl)-2 (3-nitrobenzenesulfonamido) benzamide, abbreviated 
as IMB16-4, which may be effective for the treatment of cholestasis. However, 
its poor solubility and bioavailability seriously obstruct the research 
programs.
METHODS: A hot-melt extrusion (HME) preparation was first applied to increase 
the bioavailability of IMB16-4, the oral bioavailability, anti-cholestatic 
effect and vitro cytotoxicity of IMB16-4 and IMB16-4-HME were evaluated. 
Meanwhile, the molecular docking and qRT-PCR were used to validate the mechanism 
behind.
RESULTS: The oral bioavailability of IMB16-4-HME improved 65-fold compared with 
that of pure IMB16-4. Pharmacodynamics results demonstrated that IMB16-4-HME 
prominently decreased the serum levels of total bile acid (TBA) and alkaline 
phosphatase (ALP), but elevated the level of total bilirubin (TBIL) and direct 
bilirubin (DBIL). Histopathology revealed that IMB16-4-HME at lower dose 
exhibited stronger anti-cholestatic effect compared with pure IMB16-4. In 
addition, molecular docking demonstrated that IMB16-4 has great affinity with 
PPARα, and qRT-PCR results revealed that IMB16-4-HME significantly elevated the 
mRNA expression level of PPARα, but decreased the mRNA level of CYP7A1. 
Cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that the hepatotoxicity of IMB16-4-HME was 
absolutely attributed to IMB16-4, and the excipients of IMB16-4-HME may increase 
the drug load within HepG2 cells.
CONCLUSION: The HME preparation significantly increased the oral bioavailability 
and anti-cholestatic effect of pure IMB16-4, but caused liver injury at high 
dose, which require a dose balance between the curative effect and safety in the 
future research.

Influence of Local Muscle Cooling on Mitochondrial-Related Gene Expression at 
Rest.

Robins L(1), Kwon M(1), McGlynn ML(1), Rosales AM(1)(2), Pekas EJ(1), Collins 
C(1), Park SY(1), Slivka DR(1)(2).

The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of localized cooling of 
the skeletal muscle during rest on mitochondrial related gene expression. 
Thermal wraps were applied to the vastus lateralis of each limb of 12 
participants. One limb received a cold application (randomized) (COLD), while 
the other did not (RT). Wraps were removed at the 4 h time point and 
measurements of skin temperature, blood flow, and intramuscular temperature were 
taken prior to a muscle biopsy. RT-qPCR was used to measure expression of genes 
associated with mitochondrial development. Skin and muscle temperatures were 
lower in COLD than RT (p < 0.05). Femoral artery diameter was lower in COLD 
after 4 h (0.62 ± 0.05 cm, to 0.60 ± 0.05 cm, p = 0.018). Blood flow was not 
different in COLD compared to RT (259 ± 69 mL·min-1 vs. 275 ± 54 mL·min-1, p = 
0.20). PGC-1α B and GABPA expression was higher in COLD relative to RT 
(1.57-fold, p = 0.037 and 1.34-fold, p = 0.006, respectively). There was no 
difference (p > 0.05) in the expression of PGC-1α, NT-PGC-1α, PGC-1α A, TFAM, 
ESRRα, NRF1, GABPA, VEGF, PINK1, PARK 2, or BNIP3-L. The impact of this small 
magnitude of difference in gene expression of PGC-1α B and GABPA without 
alterations in other genes are unknown. There appears to be only limited impact 
of local muscle cooling on the transcriptional response related to mitochondrial 
development.

In this work, we report the synthesis, structural characterisation and sorption 
properties of an 8-fold interpenetrated diamondoid (dia) metal-organic framework 
(MOF) that is sustained by a new extended linker ligand, [Cd(Imibz)2], 
X-dia-2-Cd, HImibz or 2 = 4-((4-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)phenylimino)methyl)benzoic 
acid. X-dia-2-Cd was found to exhibit reversible 
single-crystal-to-single-crystal (SC-SC) transformations between four distinct 
phases: an as-synthesised (from N,N-dimethylformamide) wide-pore phase, 
X-dia-2-Cd-α; a narrow-pore phase, X-dia-2-Cd-β, formed upon exposure to water; 
a narrow-pore phase obtained by activation, X-dia-2-Cd-γ; a medium-pore 
CO2-loaded phase X-dia-2-Cd-δ. While the space group remained constant in the 
four phases, the cell volumes and calculated void space ranged from 4988.7 Å3 
and 47% (X-dia-2-Cd-α), respectively, to 3200.8 Å3 and 9.1% (X-dia-2-Cd-γ), 
respectively. X-dia-2-Cd-γ also exhibited a water vapour-induced structural 
transformation to the water-loaded X-dia-2-Cd-β phase, resulting in an S-shaped 
sorption isotherm. The inflection point occurred at 18% RH with negligible 
hysteresis on the desorption profile. Water vapour temperature-humidity swing 
cycling (60% RH, 300 K to 0% RH, 333 K) indicated hydrolytic stability of 
X-dia-2-Cd and working capacity was retained after 128 cycles of sorbent 
regeneration. CO2 (at 195 K) was also observed to induce a structural 
transformation in X-dia-2-Cd-γ and in situ PXRD studies at 1 bar of CO2, 195 K 
revealed the formation of X-dia-2-Cd-δ, which exhibited 31% larger unit cell 
volume than X-dia-2-Cd-γ.

The Hepatoprotective Effect of Two Date Palm Fruit Cultivars' Extracts: Green 
Optimization of the Extraction Process.

Alqahtani NK(1), Mohamed HA(2)(3), Moawad ME(4), Younis NS(5)(6), Mohamed 
ME(5)(7).

Date palm fruit (Phoenix dactylifera: Arecaceae) is rich in essential nutrients 
and possesses several pharmacological and medicinal activities. The current 
study aimed to optimize a water bath-assisted extraction method for two 
cultivars of date palm fruits, Anbara (An) and Reziz (Rz), and investigated the 
protective effect of the optimized date palm fruit extract against CCl4-induced 
liver toxicity in relation to oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and DNA 
integrity. The optimization process of two date palm fruit cultivars was 
applied, using response surface methodology through adjusting three "factors"; 
time, temperature, and rotation, to allow maximum contents of total phenolic 
(TPC), total flavonoid (TFC), reducing power (FRAP) and scavenging activity 
(ABTS) of the extract "responses". Extraction factors' application significantly 
enhanced TPC, TFC, FRAP, and ABTS responses by 1.30, 1.23, 3.03, and 2.06-fold, 
respectively in An and 2.18, 1.71, 1.11, and 2.62-fold, respectively in Rz, in 
relation to the convectional water extraction. Furthermore, co-administered CCl4 
with An or Rz optimized extracts enhanced body weight gain, amended hepatic 
architecture, and diminished collagen fiber accumulation. Furthermore, An or Rz 
extracts reduced liver enzymes, hydroxyproline, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), MDA, 
inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α, NF-κB) levels, and DNA fragmentation, while 
increasing deteriorated adiponectin (ADP) and antioxidant enzyme (GSH, GPX, NO, 
and IFN-γ) levels, relative to CCl4-administered animals. The protective effects 
of An or Rz-optimized extracts were also evidenced by suppressing hepatic 
fibrosis and improving liver function and structure via modulating oxidative 
stress, inflammation, and apoptosis, in CCl4-induced hepatic damage. Hence, the 
optimized extraction process for the two date palm fruits resulted in extracts 
which are rich in phenolic and flavonoid contents and with an elevated 
antioxidant power. The presence of these rich extracts could help to explain 
their proven hepatoprotective activity against CCl4-induced liver toxicity.

Effects of glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase on reactive oxygen species in 
Ganoderma lucidum.

Liu H(1), Qiao J(1), Shangguan J(1), Zhu J(2).

Nitrogen metabolism can regulate mycelial growth and secondary metabolism in 
Ganoderma lucidum. As an important enzyme in intracellular amino acid 
metabolism, glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) has many physiological 
functions in animals and plants, but its function in fungi has been less 
studied. In the present study, two GOT isoenzymes were found in G. lucidum; one 
is located in the mitochondria (GOT1), and the other is located in the cytoplasm 
(GOT2). The reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was increased in got1 silenced 
strains and was approximately 1.5-fold higher than that in the wild-type (WT) 
strain, while silencing got2 did not affect the ROS level. To explore how GOT 
affects ROS in G. lucidum, experiments related to the generation and elimination 
of intracellular ROS were conducted. First, compared with that in the WT strain, 
the glutamate content, one of the substrates of GOT, decreased when got1 or got2 
was knocked down, and the glutathione (l-γ-glutamyl-l-cysteinylglycine) (GSH) 
content decreased by approximately 38.6%, 19.3%, and 40.1% in got1 silenced 
strains, got2 silenced strains, and got1/2 co-silenced strains respectively. 
Second, GOT also affects glucose metabolism. The pyruvate (PA), acetyl-CoA and 
α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) contents decreased in got1 and got2 silenced strains, and 
the transcription levels of most genes involved in the glycolytic pathway and 
the tricarboxylic acid cycle increased. The NADH content was increased in got1 
silenced strains and got2 silenced strains, and the NAD+/NADH ratio was 
decreased, which might result in mitochondrial ROS production. Compared with the 
WT strain, the mitochondrial ROS level was approximately 1.5-fold higher in the 
got1 silenced strains. In addition, silencing of got1 or got2 resulted in a 
decrease in antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase, catalase, 
glutathione reductase, and ascorbate peroxidase. Finally, ganoderic acid (GA) 
was increased by approximately 40% in got1 silenced strains compared with the WT 
strain, while silencing of got2 resulted in a 10% increase in GA biosynthesis. 
These findings provide new insights into the effect of GOT on ROS and secondary 
metabolism in fungi. KEY POINTS: • GOT plays important roles in ROS level in 
Ganoderma lucidum. • Silencing of got1 resulted in decrease in GSH content and 
antioxidant enzymes activities, but an increase in mitochondrial ROS level in G. 
lucidum. • Silencing of got1 and got2 resulted in an increase in ganoderic acid 
biosynthesis in G. lucidum.

Comparison of the Pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron Variants by 
Analyzing the Expression Patterns of Immune Response Genes in K18-hACE2 
Transgenic Mice.

Kuruppuarachchi KAPP(1)(2), Jang Y(1)(2), Seo SH(1)(2).

BACKGROUND: The recently emerged variants of the severe acute respiratory 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pose a threat to public health. Understanding the 
pathogenicity of these variants is a salient factor in the development of 
effective SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics. This study aimed to compare the expression 
patterns of genes involved in immune responses in K18-hACE2 mice infected with 
the wild-type, Delta, and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants.
METHODS: K18-hACE2 mice were intranasally infected with either wild-type (B.1), 
Delta (B.1.617.2), or Omicron (B.1.1.529) variants. On day 6 post-infection, 
lung, brain, and kidney tissues were collected from each variant-infected group. 
The mRNA expression levels of 39 immune response genes in all three groups were 
compared by RT-qPCR. Viral titers were measured using the median tissue culture 
infectious dose (TCID50) assay and expressed as Log10 TCID50/0.1 g. The 
statistical significance of the differences in gene expression was determined by 
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (alpha = 0.05).
RESULTS: The expression of toll-like receptors (TLRs) was upregulated in the 
lung and brain tissues of the wild-type- and Delta-infected groups but not in 
those of the Omicron-infected group. The highest expression of cytokines, 
including interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-1β, IL-17α, interferon, and tumor necrosis 
factors, was observed in the lungs of mice infected with the wild-type variant. 
Additionally, CCL4, CCL11, CXCL9, and CXCL10 were upregulated (>3-fold) in 
wild-type-infected mice, with markedly higher expressions in the brain than in 
the lungs. Most of the apoptotic factors were mainly expressed in the brain 
tissues of Omicron-infected mice (caspase 8, caspase 9, p53, Bax, Bak, BCL-2, 
and Bcl-XL), whereas neither the lung nor kidney showed more than 3-fold 
upregulation of these apoptotic factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our findings revealed that the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 
variant exhibited the highest pathogenicity, followed by the Delta variant, then 
the Omicron variant.

Transcription activation of latent human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) occurs 
due to HIV-1 rebound, the interruption of combination antiretroviral therapy, or 
development of drug resistance. Thus, novel HIV-1 inhibitors, targeting HIV-1 
transcription are needed. We previously developed an HIV-1 transcription 
inhibitor, 1E7-03, that binds to the noncatalytic RVxF-accommodating site of 
protein phosphatase 1 and inhibits HIV-1 replication in cultured cells and 
HIV-1-infected humanized mice by impeding protein phosphatase 1 interaction with 
HIV-1 Tat protein. However, host proteins and regulatory pathways targeted by 
1E7-03 that contribute to its overall HIV-1 inhibitory activity remain to be 
identified. To address this issue, we performed label-free quantitative proteome 
and phosphoproteome analyses of noninfected and HIV-1-infected CEM T cells that 
were untreated or treated with 1E7-03. 1E7-03 significantly reprogramed the 
phosphorylation profile of proteins including PPARα/RXRα, TGF-β, and PKR 
pathways. Phosphorylation of nucleophosmin (NPM1) at Ser-125 residue in 
PPARα/RXRα pathway was significantly reduced (>20-fold, p = 1.37 × 10-9), 
followed by the reduced phosphorylation of transforming growth factor-beta 2 at 
Ser-46 (TGF-β2, >12-fold, p = 1.37 × 10-3). Downregulation of NPM1's Ser-125 
phosphorylation was further confirmed using Western blot. Phosphorylation 
mimicking NPM1 S125D mutant activated Tat-induced HIV-1 transcription and 
exhibited enhanced NPM1-Tat interaction compared to NPM1 S125A mutant. 
Inhibition of Aurora A or Aurora B kinases that phosphorylate NPM1 on Ser-125 
residue inhibited HIV-1, further supporting the role of NPM1 in HIV-1 infection. 
Taken together, 1E7-03 reprogrammed PPARα/RXRα and TGF-β pathways that 
contribute to the inhibition of HIV-1 transcription. Our findings suggest that 
NPM1 phosphorylation is a plausible target for HIV-1 transcription inhibition.

Urine Leucine-Rich α-2 Glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) Predicts the Risk of Progression to 
End-Stage Kidney Disease in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes.

Shao YM(1), Tavintharan S(2), Tang WE(3), Sum CF(2), Lim SC(2)(4)(5).

OBJECTIVE: Leucine-rich α-2 glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) was recently identified as an 
amplifier of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-induced kidney fibrosis in 
animal models. We aimed to study whether urine LRG1 is associated with risk of 
progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in individuals with type 2 
diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 1,837 participants with type 2 diabetes 
and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >30 mL/min/1.73 m2 were 
recruited from a regional hospital and a primary care facility. Association of 
urine LRG1 with risk of ESKD (progression to sustained eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m2, 
dialysis, or death resulting from renal causes) was assessed by survival 
analyses.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 8.6 (interquartile range 5.8-9.6) years, 
134 incident ESKD events were identified. Compared with those in the lowest 
tertile, participants with baseline urine LRG1 in the highest tertile had a 
1.91-fold (95% CI 1.04-3.50) increased risk of progression to ESKD, after 
adjustment for cardiorenal risk factors, including eGFR and albuminuria. As a 
continuous variable, 1 SD increment in urine LRG1 was associated with a 
1.53-fold (95% CI 1.19-1.98) adjusted risk of ESKD. Of note, the association of 
urine LRG1 with ESKD was independent of plasma LRG1. Moreover, urine LRG1 was 
associated with rapid kidney function decline and progression to 
macroalbuminuria, two common pathways leading to ESKD.
CONCLUSIONS: Urine LRG1, a TGF-β signaling modulator, predicts risk of 
progression to ESKD independently of clinical risk factors in patients with type 
2 diabetes, suggesting that it may be a novel factor involved in the 
pathophysiological pathway leading to kidney disease progression.

The development of vaccine candidates for COVID-19 has been rapid, and those 
that are currently approved display high efficacy against the original 
circulating strains. However, recently, new variants of severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have emerged with increased transmission 
rates and less susceptibility to vaccine induced immunity. A greater 
understanding of protection mechanisms, including antibody longevity and 
cross-reactivity towards the variants of concern (VoCs), is needed. In this 
study, samples collected in Denmark early in the pandemic from paucisymptomatic 
subjects (n = 165) and symptomatic subjects (n = 57) infected with SARS-CoV-2 
were used to assess IgG binding and inhibition in the form of 
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) competition against the 
wild-type and four SARS-CoV-2 VoCs (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Omicron). Antibodies 
induced early in the pandemic via natural infection were cross-reactive and 
inhibited ACE2 binding of the VoC, with reduced inhibition observed for the 
Omicron variant. When examined longitudinally, sustained cross-reactive 
inhibitory responses were found to exist in naturally infected paucisymptomatic 
subjects. After vaccination, receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific IgG binding 
increased by at least 3.5-fold and inhibition of ACE2 increased by at least 
2-fold. When vaccination regimens were compared (two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech 
BNT162b2 (n = 50), or one dose of Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 followed by 
Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 (ChAd/BNT) (n = 15)), higher levels of IgG binding and 
inhibition were associated with mix and match (ChAd/BNT) prime-boosting and time 
since vaccination. These results are particularly relevant for countries where 
vaccination levels are low.

Public health emergencies like SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 have prioritized 
surveillance of zoonotic coronaviruses, resulting in extensive genomic 
characterization of coronavirus diversity in bats. Sequencing viral genomes 
directly from animal specimens remains a laboratory challenge, however, and most 
bat coronaviruses have been characterized solely by PCR amplification of small 
regions from the best-conserved gene. This has resulted in limited phylogenetic 
resolution and left viral genetic factors relevant to threat assessment 
undescribed. In this study, we evaluated whether a technique called 
hybridization probe capture can achieve more extensive genome recovery from 
surveillance specimens. Using a custom panel of 20,000 probes, we captured and 
sequenced coronavirus genomic material in 21 swab specimens collected from bats 
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. For 15 of these specimens, probe 
capture recovered more genome sequence than had been previously generated with 
standard amplicon sequencing protocols, providing a median 6.1-fold improvement 
(ranging up to 69.1-fold). Probe capture data also identified five novel alpha- 
and betacoronaviruses in these specimens, and their full genomes were recovered 
with additional deep sequencing. Based on these experiences, we discuss how 
probe capture could be effectively operationalized alongside other sequencing 
technologies for high-throughput, genomics-based discovery and surveillance of 
bat coronaviruses.

Changes in the gut bacteriome upon gluten-free diet intervention do not mediate 
beta cell preservation.

M(4), Petruzelkova L(2), Havlik J(5), Mascellani A(5), Henke S(6), Sumnik Z(2), 
Cinek O(2).

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We previously detected indications that beta cell function is 
protected by gluten-free diet (GFD) introduced shortly after the onset of 
childhood type 1 diabetes. The present aim was to assess whether GFD was 
associated with changes in the gut bacteriome composition and in its functional 
capacity, and whether such changes mediated the observed effects of GFD on beta 
cell function.
METHODS: Forty-five children (aged 10.2 ± 3.3 years) were recruited into a 
self-selected intervention trial primarily focused on determining the role of 
GFD on beta cell preservation ( ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02867436). Stool samples 
were collected prior to the dietary intervention and then at 3-month intervals. 
A total of 128 samples from the GFD group and 112 from the control group were 
analysed for bacteriome 16S rDNA community profiles, the bacteriome functional 
capacity was predicted using PICRUSt2 and actual gut metabolome profiles 
measured using NMR. Intestinal permeability was assessed using serum zonulin 
concentrations at 1, 6 and 12 months and lactulose/mannitol tests at the end of 
intervention. Dietary questionnaires were used to ensure that the dietary 
intervention did not result in differences in energy or nutrient intake.
RESULTS: The bacteriome community composition changed during the intervention 
with GFD: of abundant genera, a 3.3-fold decrease was noted for Bifidobacterium 
genus (adjusted p=1.4 × 10-4 in a DESeq2 model, p=0.026 in generalised 
estimating equations model), whereas a 2.4-fold increase was observed in 
Roseburia (adjusted p=0.02 in DESeq2 model, p=0.002 in generalised estimating 
equations model). The within-sample (alpha) diversity did not change, and there 
was no statistically significant clustering of GFD samples in the ordination 
graphs of beta diversity. Neither of the genera changes upon GFD intervention 
showed any association with the pace of beta cell loss (p>0.50), but of the 
remaining taxa, several genera of Bacteroidaceae family yielded suggestive 
signals. The faecal metabolome profile ordination correlated with that of 
bacteriomes but did not associate with GFD or categories of beta cell 
preservation. There was no indication of changes in gut permeability.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The bacteriome reacted to GFD, but the changes were 
unrelated to the pace of beta cell capacity loss. The previously observed 
moderately protective effect of GFD is therefore mediated through other 
pathways.

The effects of mechanical instability on PDGF mediated inflammatory response at 
early stage of fracture healing under diabetic condition.

Zhang E(1), Miramini S(1), Patel M(2), Richardson M(2), Ebeling P(3), Zhang 
L(4).

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Mechanical stability plays an important role in 
fracture healing process. Excessive interfragmentary movement will continuously 
damage the tissue and newly formed capillaries at the fracture site, which leads 
to overproduction of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) that attracts more 
macrophages into fracture callus, ultimately persistent and enhanced 
inflammatory response happens. For diabetic condition, the impact of mechanical 
instability of fracture site on inflammatory response could be further 
compliciated and the relevant research in this field is relatively limited.
METHODS: Building on previous experimental studies, this study presents a 
numerical model consisting of a system of reactive-transport equations 
representing the transport as well as interactions of different cells and 
cytokines within the fracture callus. The model is initially validated by 
available experimental data, and then implemented to investigate the role of 
mechanical stability of fracture site in inflammatory response during early 
stage of healing. It is assumed that there is an increased release of PDGF due 
to the rupture of blood vessels resulting from mechanical instability, which 
leads to increased production of inflammatory cytokines (i.e., TNF-α). The bone 
healing process under three different conditions were investigated, i.e., 
mechanically stable condition with normal inflammatory response (Control, Case 
1), mechanically unstable condition with normal inflammatory response (Case 2) 
and mechanically unstable condition with diabetes (Case 3).
RESULTS: Mechanical instability can promote the macrophage infiltration and thus 
induce an enhanced and prolonged inflammatory response, which could impede the 
MSCs proliferation during the early fracture healing stage (e.g., compared with 
the control condition, the MSCs concentration in unstable fracture with normal 
inflammatory response can be reduced by 3.2% and 5.2% on day 2 and day 10 
post-fracture, respectively). Under diabetic condition, the mechanical 
instability of fracture site could lead to a significant increase of TNF-α 
concentration in fracture callus (Case 3) in comparison to control (Case 1) 
(e.g., three-fold increase in TNF-α concentration compared to control). In 
addition, the results show that the mechanical instability affects the cell 
differentiation and proliferation in fracture callus in a spatially dependent 
manner, e.g., for diabetic fracture patients, the mechanical instability could 
potentially decrease the concentration of MSCs, osteoblasts and chondrocytes by 
around 39%, 30% and 29% in cortical callus, respectively, in comparison to 
control.
CONCLUSION: The mechanical instability together with diabetic condition can 
significantly affect the natural resolution of inflammation during early stage 
of healing by turning acute inflammation into chronic inflammation which is 
characterized by a continuously upregulated TNF-α pathway.

Demographic, clinical and genetic factors associated with COVID-19 disease 
susceptibility and mortality in a Kurdish population.

Smail SW(1), Babaei E(2)(3), Amin K(4)(5).

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a devastating pandemic that 
causes disease with a variability in susceptibility and mortality based on 
variants of various clinical and demographic factors, including particular genes 
among populations.
OBJECTIVES: Determine associations of demographic, clinical, laboratory, and 
single nucleotide polymorphisms in the ACE2, TMPRSS2, TNF-α, and IFN-γ genes to 
the incidence of infection and mortality in COVID-19 patients.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study SETTINGS: Various cities in the Kurdistan 
Region of Iraq.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective cohort study compared laboratory markers 
(D-dimer, tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-α], interferon-gamma [IFN-γ], 
C-reactive protein [CRP], lymphocyte and neutrophil counts) between COVID-19 
patients and healthy controls. DNA was extracted from blood, and genotypes were 
done by Sanger sequencing.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Single nucleotide polymorphisms of the ACE2, TMPRSS2, 
TNF-α, and IFN-γ genes and demographic characteristics and laboratory markers 
for predicting mortality in COVID-19.
SAMPLE SIZE: 203 (153 COVID-19 patients, 50 health control subjects).
RESULTS: Forty-eight (31.4%) of the COVID-19 patients died. Age over 40 and 
comorbidities were risk factors for mortality, but the strongest associations 
were with serum IFN-γ, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and serum 
TNF-α. The AA genotype and A allele of TMPRSS2 rs2070788 decreased while the GA 
genotype and A allele of TNF-α increased susceptibility to COVID-19. Patients 
with the GA genotype of TNF-α rs1800629 had shorter survival times (9.9 days) 
than those carrying the GG genotype (18.3 days) (P<.0001 by log-rank test). The 
GA genotype versus the GG genotype was associated with higher levels of serum 
TNF-α. The GA genotype increased mortality rates by up to 3.8 fold. The survival 
rate for COVID-19 patients carrying the IFN-γ rs2430561 TT genotype (58.5%) was 
lower than in patients with the TA and AA genotypes (80.3%). The TT genotype 
increased the risk of death (HR=3.664, P<.0001) and was linked to high serum 
IFN-γ production. Olfactory dysfunction was a predictor of survival among 
COVID-19 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Age older than 40, comorbidities, the NLR and particular genotypes 
for and the IFN-γ and TNF-α genes were risk factors for death. Larger studies in 
different populations must be conducted to validate the possible role of 
particular SNPs as genetic markers for disease severity and mortality in 
COVID-19 disease.
LIMITATIONS: Small sample size.
CONFLICT OF INTEREST: None.

Prognostic significance of inflammatory and nutritional markers in perioperative 
period for patients with advanced gastric cancer.

Zhang R(1), Hu C(1), Zhang J(1), Zhang Y(2), Yuan L(2), Yu P(3), Wang Y(3), Bao 
Z(3), Cao M(4), Ruan R(5), Cheng X(6), Xu Z(7).

BACKGROUND: It has been reported that inflammatory and nutritional markers are 
related to prognosis in numerous malignancies. The present study analyzed the 
significance of these markers' alterations during neoadjuvant chemotherapy in 
the long-term outcomes in patients with advanced gastric cancer.
METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of 437 advanced gastric cancer 
patients who underwent a neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) regimen followed by 
surgical treatment. Inflammatory and nutritional markers measured from the blood 
samples collected from the patients before the first neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
and after the last neoadjuvant chemotherapy were used for analysis. Statistical 
analysis, including Mann-Whitney U or chi-square tests, the Kaplan-Meier method 
and Cox multivariate analysis, were performed to analyze the predictive value of 
these markers for overall survival outcomes (OS).
RESULTS: Most biomarkers, including lymphocyte, leucocyte, neutrophil, monocyte, 
platelet, LMR, PLR, SII, CRP, CAR, hemoglobulin and albumin levels, changed 
during NACT (P <  0.05). After separately grouping the patients based on the 
normal range of hematologic indexes and the change rate (α) of systemic 
inflammatory and nutritional markers by the cutoff value derived from X-tile 
(P <  0.05), we found that differentiation, TRG, pre-NACT BMI, pre-NACT platelet 
counts, post-NACT lymphocyte counts, the change in lymphocyte counts, change in 
platelet counts and LMR(α), PLR(α), SII(α), and CAR(α) were associated with OS. 
Multivariate analysis revealed that PLR (α) > - 19% was correlated with a 
3.193-fold (95% CI: 2.194-4.649) higher risk of death (P <  0.001) than others.
CONCLUSION: NACT could significantly change several inflammatory and nutritional 
markers in the perioperative period; the platelet counts before NACT, and the 
change in lymphocytes during NACT truly correlated with long-term outcomes among 
patients with advanced gastric cancer. The systemic inflammatory marker PLR may 
be a reliable marker for the prediction of prognosis.

Percutaneous carbon-PEEK instrumentation for spine tumors: a prospective 
observational study.

Trungu S(1)(2), Ricciardi L(3)(4), Forcato S(3), Scollato A(3), Minniti G(5), 
Miscusi M(4), Raco A(4).

BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive spine surgery (MISS) has been progressively 
accepted as a useful approach for spine tumors. Recently released carbon-PEEK 
implants have been already reported as effective in open surgeries for spine 
tumors. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, surgical, clinical and 
radiological outcomes of a new percutaneous carbon-PEEK instrumentations for 
spine tumors.
METHODS: This is a prospective case-control observational study. Demographical, 
clinical, surgical, and radiological data were collected from May 2018 to August 
2019. Visual Analogue Scale for back pain (VAS), the Oswestry Disability Index 
(ODI) Questionnaire, EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire for quality of life, and ASIA 
Impairment Scale (AIS) were collected before surgery and at 6 weeks and 
follow-up (FU) visits. Data were compared with the control group, a 
retrospective series of 23 metastatic patients that underwent titanium pedicle 
screw fixation.
RESULTS: Twenty-one patients met inclusion criteria. Mean age was 59.2 years 
(range, 35-78) and mean FU was 14.2 months (7-22). Thoracic spine was involved 
in 14 (66.7%) cases, lumbar spine in 7 (33.3%). The mean length of surgery was 
75 (42-185) minutes, mean blood loss was 90ml (50-215) and every patient was 
mobilized within 24 hours after surgery. The VAS (8.3±1.1 to 2.9±1.0, P<0.05) 
and ODI (54.6±11.7 to 25.1±5.4, P<0.05) scores significantly improved over 
follow-up. AIS improved in 7 (33.3%) patients and remained unchanged in 14 
(66.7%). The EORTC QLQ-C30 global health/QoL, functional and symptomatic scales 
significantly improved postoperatively and at the last follow-up. Only two minor 
complications (9.5%) were recorded. No statistically significant difference was 
observed between the two groups related to clinical, radiological outcomes, 
complications rate and implant failure.
CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous Carbon/PEEK implants could be considered as 
alternative to standard titanium implants in oncological patients, according to 
their lower rate of MRI artifacts, facilitating radiological FU and adjuvant 
radiotherapy. Further clinical trials and biomechanical evaluations are needed 
to confirm our preliminary results.

Implication of inflammation on Coxsackie virus and Adenovirus receptor 
expression on cardiomyocytes and the role of platelets in patients with dilated 
cardiomyopathy.

Gupalo EM(1), Buryachkovskaya LI(2), Chumachenko PV(2), Mironova NA(2), Narusov 
OY(2), Tereschenko SN(2), Golitsyn SP(2), Othman M(3).

BACKGROUND: Coxsackie Virus and Adenovirus Receptor (CXADR or CAR) is involved 
in the pathogenesis of inflammatory dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). We aimed to 
examine the relationship of CAR expression on platelets and cardiomyocytes with 
virus persistence, local and systemic inflammation and platelet activity in 
patients with DCM.
METHODS: Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) samples of 38 patients (mean age 39.5±11.3 
years, 20 male) with DCM were analyzed for CAR expression, local inflammation 
grade by immunohistochemistry and virus persistence by real-time PCR. Platelet 
morphology was analyzed in all patients and 30 healthy subjects (HS) using 
scanning electron microscopy, platelet activity by light transmission 
aggregation, and CAR persistence by immunofluorescence. Platelets of 20 patients 
were analyzed for cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus 1-2 by 
immunofluorescence. Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF α) and 
Interleukin-6 were assessed using ELISA in all studied subjects.
RESULTS: CAR expression in EMB samples was related to the heart failure 
functional class and the level of IL-6. Platelets from DCM patients showed 
enhanced spontaneous and ADP induced aggregation. Platelets' CAR expression was 
>4 fold higher in DCM than HS and was observed predominantly at sites of 
intercellular communications in microaggregates and leukocyte-platelet 
aggregates. CAR-positive patients showed significantly higher TNF-α and IL-6 
serum levels in CAR-negative patients. Platelets of 6 (30%) DCM patients 
revealed the mature cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex viruses particles.
CONCLUSION: Tight junction protein CAR may serve as a docking pin creating a new 
type of contact structure that could be responsible for signaling between 
neighboring cells in pathological conditions.

Photocatalytic reactive liquid microjunction surface sampling-mass spectrometry 
for rapid and selective in-situ analysis of alpha-unsubstituted amine 
metabolites or drugs in brain tissue.

Zhang L(1), Huang Y(1), Zhou Y(1), Wu Q(2), Wang Y(3), Lu H(1).

In in-situ mass spectrometry (MS), different on-tissue derivatization methods 
have been developed to enhance the signals of poorly ionizable primary amines. 
However, those chemical derivatization methods are laborious and time-consuming, 
and are usually limited to detection of high-abundance amino acids which 
suppress the reaction of low-abundance monoamine neurotransmitters and drugs. 
Herein, A rapid and selective photocatalytic derivatization technique for 
alpha-unsubstituted primary amine was developed with 5-hydroxyindole as 
derivatization reagent and TiO2 as photocatalyst, and was introduced into liquid 
microjunction surface sampling (LMJSS)-MS system as online derivatization. The 
results showed that the photocatalytic derivatization method largely enhanced 
the signals of primary amines by 5-300 fold, and were selective to 
alpha-unsubstituted primary amines. Thus, the suppression effects from 
high-abundance amino acids to the reaction of monoamine neurotransmitters and 
benzylamine drugs proved to be largely reduced in the new method (matrix 
effect>50%) comparing with those in chemical derivatization method (matrix 
effect<10%). In addition, the optimal pH of the derivatization reaction was 
measured to be 7, which indicates the mild and physiologically compatible 
reaction conditions. By in-situ synthesis of TiO2 monolith in the transfer 
capillary of the LMJSS-MS system, rapid on-line photocatalytic derivatization 
was achieved and completed in 5 s during the transfer of sampling extract from 
the flow-probe to the MS inlet. With the new photocatalytic reactive LMJSS-MS 
method, detection limits of three primary amines on glass slides were in the 
range of 0.031-0.17 ng/mm2 with acceptable linearity (r=0.9815-0.9998) and 
relatively high repeatability (relative standard deviations <22.1%). Finally, 
endogenous tyramine, serotonin, two dipeptides and one doped benzylamine drug 
were identified and in-situ analyzed in the mouse cerebrum by the new method 
with largely enhanced signals comparing with LMJSS-MS without online 
derivatization. The new method provides a more selective, rapid and automated

Aldol Cleavage in Water and the Power of Citrate Lyase as a Catalyst.

Lewis CA Jr(1), Wolfenden R(1).

Citrate lyase allows Klebsiella aerogenes to grow anaerobically on citrate as 
the sole carbon source. Arrhenius analysis of experiments at high temperatures 
indicates that citrate is cleaved nonenzymatically to acetate and oxaloacetate 
with a t1/2 of 6.9 million years in neutral solution at 25 °C, while malate 
cleavage occurs even more slowly (t1/2 = 280 million years). However, t1/2 is 
only 10 days for the nonenzymatic cleavage of 4-hydroxy-2-ketoglutarate, 
indicating that the introduction of an α-keto group enhances the rate of aldol 
cleavage of malate by a factor of 1010. The aldol cleavages of citrate and 
malate, like the decarboxylation of malonate (t1/2 = 180 years), are associated 
with a near-zero entropy of activation, and their extreme differences in rate 
reflect differences between their heats of activation. Citrate lyase enhances 
the rate of substrate cleavage 6 × 1015-fold, comparable in magnitude with the 
rate enhancement produced by OMP decarboxylase, although these enzymes are 
strikingly different in their mechanisms of action.

Protein engineering of antifreeze proteins reveals that their activity scales 
with the area of the ice-binding site.

Scholl CL(1), Davies PL(1).

Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) protect organisms from freezing by binding to ice 
crystals to prevent their growth. Here, we have investigated how the area of an 
AFP's ice-binding site (IBS) changes its antifreeze activity. The polyproline 
type II helical bundle fold of the 9.6-kDa springtail (Collembola) AFP from 
Granisotoma rainieri (a primitive arthropod) facilitates changes to both IBS 
length and width. A one quarter decrease in area reduced activity to less than 
10%. A one quarter increase in IBS width, through the addition of a single 
helix, tripled antifreeze activity. However, increasing IBS length by a similar 
amount actually reduced activity. Expanding the IBS area can greatly increase 
antifreeze activity but needs to be evaluated by experimentation on a 
case-by-case basis.

Quantitative proteomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection of primary human airway 
ciliated cells and lung epithelial cells demonstrates the effectiveness of 
SARS-CoV-2 innate immune evasion.

LM(2), Gabaev I(1), Teixeira-Silva A(1), Grice GL(1), Wickenhagen A(3), Stanton 
RJ(4), Wang ECY(4), Wilson SJ(3), Matheson NJ(1)(5), Nathan JA(1), McCaughan 
F(2), Lehner PJ(1).

Background: Quantitative proteomics is able to provide a comprehensive, unbiased 
description of changes to cells caused by viral infection, but interpretation 
may be complicated by differential changes in infected and uninfected 
'bystander' cells, or the use of non-physiological cellular models. Methods: In 
this paper, we use fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and quantitative 
proteomics to analyse cell-autonomous changes caused by authentic SARS-CoV-2 
infection of respiratory epithelial cells, the main target of viral infection in 
vivo. First, we determine the relative abundance of proteins in primary human 
airway epithelial cells differentiated at the air-liquid interface (basal, 
secretory and ciliated cells). Next, we specifically characterise changes caused 
by SARS-CoV-2 infection of ciliated cells. Finally, we compare temporal 
proteomic changes in infected and uninfected 'bystander' Calu-3 lung epithelial 
cells and compare infection with B.29 and B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variants. Results: 
Amongst 5,709 quantified proteins in primary human airway ciliated cells, the 
abundance of 226 changed significantly in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection 
(q <0.05 and >1.5-fold). Notably, viral replication proceeded without inducing a 
type-I interferon response. Amongst 6,996 quantified proteins in Calu-3 cells, 
the abundance of 645 proteins changed significantly in the presence of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection (q < 0.05 and > 1.5-fold). In contrast to the primary cell 
model, a clear type I interferon (IFN) response was observed. Nonetheless, 
induction of IFN-inducible proteins was markedly attenuated in infected cells, 
compared with uninfected 'bystander' cells. Infection with B.29 and B.1.1.7 
(Alpha) variants gave similar results. Conclusions: Taken together, our data 
provide a detailed proteomic map of changes in SARS-CoV-2-infected respiratory 
epithelial cells in two widely used, physiologically relevant models of 
infection. As well as identifying dysregulated cellular proteins and processes, 
the effectiveness of strategies employed by SARS-CoV-2 to avoid the type I IFN 
response is illustrated in both models.

Rapid emergence from dexmedetomidine sedation in Sprague Dawley rats by 
repurposing an α(2)-adrenergic receptor competitive antagonist in combination 
with caffeine.

Xie Z(1), Fox AP(2).

BACKGROUND: The α2 adrenergic receptor agonist dexmedetomidine is an important 
intravenous sedative with analgesic properties. Currently available 
dexmedetomidine reversal agents, like the α2-receptor antagonist atipamezole, 
cause serious adverse effects at the large dosages required for effective 
reversal; they are not used clinically. Without reversal agents, emergence times 
from dexmedetomidine sedation are slow. In this study we tested the ability of 
low-dose atipamezole, in combination with caffeine, to reverse dexmedetomidine 
sedation. The low dose of atipamezole employed should not be associated with 
unwanted effects.
METHODS: Two different sedation protocols were employed. In the first protocol, 
a bolus of dexmedetomidine was rapidly applied and the drug was allowed to 
equilibrate for 10 min before rats received either saline (as control) or 
low-dose atipamezole with caffeine. Following this procedure, rats were placed 
on their backs. Emergence from sedation was the time for rats to recover their 
righting reflex and stand with 4 paws on the floor. A second sedation protocol 
simulated a pediatric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Adult rats were 
sedated with dexmedetomidine for one hour followed by 30 min with both 
dexmedetomidine and propofol. At the end of 90 min, rats received either saline 
(control) or a combination of low-dose atipamezole, and caffeine. Recovery of 
the righting reflex was used as a proxy for emergence from sedation.
RESULTS: Emergence from sedation, the time for rats to recover their righting 
reflex, decreased by ~ 90% when using an atipamezole dose ~ 20 fold lower than 
manufacturer's recommendation, supplemented with caffeine. Using an atipamezole 
dose ~ tenfold lower than recommended, with caffeine, emergence times decreased 
by ~ 97%. A different stimulant, forskolin, when tested, was as effective as 
caffeine. For the MRI simulation, emergence times were decreased by ~ 93% by 
low-dose atipamezole with caffeine.
CONCLUSIONS: Low dose atipamezole with caffeine was effective at reversing 
dexmedetomidine sedation. Emergence was rapid and the rats regained not only 
their righting reflex but also their balance and their ability to carry out 
complex behaviors. These findings suggest that the combination of low dose 
atipamezole with caffeine may permit rapid clinical reversal of dexmedetomidine 
without unwanted effects.

Identification of a TNF-TNFR-like system in malaria vectors (Anopheles 
stephensi) likely to influence Plasmodium resistance.

A(3), Mahawar H(3), Jaisimha A(3), Krishna M(3), Chattopadhyay A(3), Borah R(3),

Identification of Plasmodium-resistance genes in malaria vectors remains an 
elusive goal despite the recent availability of high-quality genomes of several 
mosquito vectors. Anopheles stephensi, with its three distinctly-identifiable 
forms at the egg stage, correlating with varying vector competence, offers an 
ideal species to discover functional mosquito genes implicated in Plasmodium 
resistance. Recently, the genomes of several strains of An. stephensi of the 
type-form, known to display high vectorial capacity, were reported. Here, we 
report a chromosomal-level assembly of an intermediate-form of An. stephensi 
strain (IndInt), shown to have reduced vectorial capacity relative to a strain 
of type-form (IndCh). The contig level assembly with a L50 of 4 was scaffolded 
into chromosomes by using the genome of IndCh as the reference. The final 
assembly shows a heterozygous paracentric inversion, 3Li, involving 8 Mbp, which 
is syntenic to the extensively-studied 2La inversion implicated in Plasmodium 
resistance in An. gambiae involving 21 Mbp. Deep annotation of genes within the 
3Li region in the IndInt assembly using the state-of-the-art protein-fold 
prediction and other annotation tools reveals the presence of a tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) like gene, which is the homolog of the Eiger gene in 
Drosophila. Subsequent chromosome-wide searches revealed homologs of Wengen 
(Wgn) and Grindelwald (Grnd) genes, which are known to be the receptors for 
Eiger in Drosophila. We have identified all the genes in IndInt required for 
Eiger-mediated signaling by analogy to the TNF-alpha system, suggesting the 
presence of a functionally-active Eiger signaling pathway in IndInt. Comparative 
genomics of the three type-forms with that of IndInt, reveals structurally 
disruptive mutations in Eiger gene in all three strains of the type-form, 
suggesting compromised innate immunity in the type-form as the likely cause of 
high vectorial capacity in these strains. This is the first report of the 
presence of a homolog of Eiger in malaria vectors, known to be involved in cell 
death in Drosophila, within an inversion region in IndInt syntenic to an 
inversion associated with Plasmodium resistance in An. gambiae.

Hemolymph of triatomines presents fungistatic activity against Cryptococcus 
neoformans and improves macrophage function through MCP-I/TNF-α increase.

Menezes-Silva L(1)(2), Catarino JDS(1)(3), de Faria LC(1)(2), Pizzolante 
BC(1)(2), Andrade-Silva LE(1), da Silva MV(1), Rodrigues V(1), Sales-Campos 
H(1)(4), Oliveira CJF(1).

BACKGROUND: Triatomines are blood-feeding arthropods belonging to the subfamily 
Triatominae (Hemiptera; Reduviidae), capable of producing immunomodulatory and 
water-soluble molecules in their hemolymph, such as antimicrobial peptides 
(AMPs). In this work, we evaluated the antifungal and immunomodulatory activity 
of the hemolymph of Meccus pallidipennis (MPH) and Rhodnius prolixus (RPH) 
against Cryptococcus neoformans.
METHODS: We assessed the activity of the hemolymph of both insects on fungal 
growth by a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay. Further, RAW 264.7 
macrophages were cultivated with hemolymph and challenged with C. neoformans. 
Then, their phagocytic and killing activities were assessed. The cytokines 
MCP-1, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-10, IL-12, and IL-6 were measured in culture 
supernatants 4- and 48-hours post-infection.
RESULTS: Both hemolymph samples directly affected the growth rate of the fungus 
in a dose-dependent manner. Either MPH or RPH was capable of inhibiting fungal 
growth by at least 70%, using the lowest dilution (1:20). Treatment of RAW 264.7 
macrophages with hemolymph of both insects was capable of increasing the 
production of MCP-I and TNF-α. In addition, when these cells were stimulated 
with hemolymph in the presence of C. neoformans, a 2- and a 4-fold increase in 
phagocytic rate was observed with MPH and RPH, respectively, when compared to 
untreated cells. For the macrophage killing activity, MPH decreased in 
approximately 30% the number of viable yeasts inside the cells compared to 
untreated control; however, treatment with RPH could not reduce the total number 
of viable yeasts. MPH was also capable of increasing MHC-II expression on 
macrophages. Regarding the cytokine production, MCP-I and TNF-α, were increased 
in the supernatant of macrophages treated with both hemolymphs, 4 and 48 hours 
after stimulation.
CONCLUSION: These results suggested that hemolymph of triatomines may represent 
a source of molecules capable of presenting antifungal and immunomodulatory 
activity in macrophages during fungal infection.

Metamorphic proteins under a computational microscope: Lessons from a 
fold-switching RfaH protein.

Artsimovitch I(1), Ramírez-Sarmiento CA(2)(3).

Metamorphic proteins constitute unexpected paradigms of the protein folding 
problem, as their sequences encode two alternative folds, which reversibly 
interconvert within biologically relevant timescales to trigger different 
cellular responses. Once considered a rare aberration, metamorphism may be 
common among proteins that must respond to rapidly changing environments, 
exemplified by NusG-like proteins, the only transcription factors present in 
every domain of life. RfaH, a specialized paralog of bacterial NusG, undergoes 
an all-α to all-β domain switch to activate expression of virulence and 
conjugation genes in many animal and plant pathogens and is the quintessential 
example of a metamorphic protein. The dramatic nature of RfaH structural 
transformation and the richness of its evolutionary history makes for an 
excellent model for studying how metamorphic proteins switch folds. Here, we 
summarize the structural and functional evidence that sparked the discovery of 
RfaH as a metamorphic protein, the experimental and computational approaches 
that enabled the description of the molecular mechanism and refolding pathways 
of its structural interconversion, and the ongoing efforts to find signatures 
and general properties to ultimately describe the protein metamorphome.

Empirical Study of Protein Feature Representation on Deep Belief Networks 
Trained With Small Data for Secondary Structure Prediction.

Rashid S, Sundaram S, Kwoh CK.

Protein secondary structure (SS) prediction is a classic problem of 
computational biology and is widely used in structural characterization and to 
infer homology. While most SS predictors have been trained on thousands of 
sequences, a previous approach had developed a compact model of training 
proteins that used a C-Alpha, C-Beta Side Chain (CABS)-algorithm derived energy 
based feature representation. Here, the previous approach is extended to Deep 
Belief Networks (DBN). Deep learning methods are notorious for requiring large 
datasets and there is a wide consensus that training deep models from scratch on 
small datasets, works poorly. By contrast, we demonstrate a simple DBN 
architecture containing a single hidden layer, trained only on the CB513 
dataset. Testing on an independent set of G Switch proteins improved the Q 3 
score of the previous compact model by almost 3%. The findings are further 
confirmed by comparison to several deep learning models which are trained on 
thousands of proteins. Finally, the DBN performance is also compared with 
Position Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM)-profile based feature representation. 
The importance of (i) structural information in protein feature representation 
and (ii) complementary small dataset learning approaches for detection of 
structural fold switching are demonstrated.

Computational Mechanistic Study of l-Aspartate Oxidase by ONIOM Method.

Yildiz I(1).

l-Aspartate oxidase (Laspo) is responsible for the oxidation of l-aspartate into 
iminoaspartate using flavin as a cofactor. During this process flavin is 
reduced, and it can be reoxidized by either molecular oxygen or fumarate. The 
overall fold and the catalytic residues of Laspo are similar to succinate 
dehydrogenase and fumarate reductase. On the basis of deuterium kinetic isotope 
effects as well as other kinetic and structural data, it is proposed that the 
enzyme can catalyze the oxidation of l-aspartate through a mechanism similar to 
amino acid oxidases. It is suggested that a proton is removed from the α-amino 
group, while a hydride is transferred from C2 to flavin. It is also suggested 
that the hydride transfer is a rate-limiting step. However, there is still an 
ambiguity about the stepwise or concerted mechanism of hydride- and 
proton-transfer steps. In this study, we formulated some computational models to 
study the hydride-transfer mechanism using the crystal structure of Escherichia 
colil-aspartate oxidase in complexes with succinate. The calculations involved 
our own N-layered integrated molecular orbital and molecular mechanics method, 
and we evaluated the geometry and energetics of the hydride/proton-transfer 
processes while probing the roles of active site residues. Based on the 
calculations, it is concluded that proton- and hydride-transfer steps are 
decoupled, and a stepwise mechanism might be operative as opposed to the 
concerted one.

Crystal structure of a mycobacterial secretory protein Rv0398c and in silico 
prediction of its export pathway.

Saha R(1), Mukherjee S(1), Singh B(1), De S(2), Weiss MS(3), Das AK(4).

Secretory proteins are used by pathogenic bacteria to manipulate the host 
systems and compete with other microorganisms, thereby enabling their survival 
in their host. Similar to other bacteria, secretory proteins of Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis also play a pivotal role in evading immune response within hosts, 
thereby leading to acute and latent tuberculosis infection. Prokaryotes have 
several classes of bacterial secretory systems out of which the Sec and Tat 
pathways are the most conserved in Mtb to transport proteins across the 
cytoplasmic membrane. Here, we report the crystal structure of a secretory 
protein, Rv0398c determined to 1.9 Å resolution. The protein comprises a core of 
antiparallel β sheets surrounded by α helices adopting a unique β sandwich fold. 
Structural comparison with other secretory proteins in Mtb and other pathogenic 
bacteria reveals that Rv0398c may be secreted via the Sec pathway. Our 
structural and in silico analyses thus provide mechanistic insights into the 
pathway adopted by Mtb to transport out secretory protein, Rv0398c which will 
facilitate the invasion to the host immune system.

Ginsenoside Rd ameliorates muscle wasting by suppressing the signal transducer 
and activator of transcription 3 pathway.

YK(1)(2), Lim JY(5)(6), Yoon JK(1)(2), Lee SH(7), Kwon HY(1)(2).

BACKGROUND: The effects of some drugs, aging, cancers, and other diseases can 
cause muscle wasting. Currently, there are no effective drugs for treating 
muscle wasting. In this study, the effects of ginsenoside Rd (GRd) on muscle 
wasting were studied.
METHODS: Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)/interferon-gamma (IFN-γ)-induced 
myotube atrophy in mouse C2C12 and human skeletal myoblasts (HSkM) was evaluated 
based on cell thickness. Atrophy-related signalling, reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) level, mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitochondrial number were 
assessed. GRd (10 mg/kg body weight) was orally administered to aged mice 
(23-24 months old) and tumour-bearing (Lewis lung carcinoma [LLC1] or CT26) mice 
for 5 weeks and 16 days, respectively. Body weight, grip strength, inverted 
hanging time, and muscle weight were assessed. Histological analysis was also 
performed to assess the effects of GRd. The evolutionary chemical binding 
similarity (ECBS) approach, molecular docking, Biacore assay, and signal 
transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 reporter assay were used to 
identify targets of GRd.
RESULTS: GRd significantly induced hypertrophy in the C2C12 and HSkM myotubes 
(average diameter 50.8 ± 2.6% and 49.9% ± 3.7% higher at 100 nM, vs. control, 
P ≤ 0.001). GRd treatment ameliorated aging- and cancer-induced (LLC1 or CT26) 
muscle atrophy in mice, which was evidenced by significant increases in grip 
strength, hanging time, muscle mass, and muscle tissue cross-sectional area 
(1.3-fold to 4.6-fold, vs. vehicle, P ≤ 0.05; P ≤ 0.01; P ≤ 0.001). STAT3 was 
found to be a possible target of GRd by the ECBS approach and molecular docking 
assay. Validation of direct interaction between GRd and STAT3 was confirmed 
through Biacore analysis. GRd also inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation and STAT3 
reporter activity, which led to the inhibition of STAT3 nuclear translocation 
and the suppression of downstream targets of STAT3, such as atrogin-1, 
muscle-specific RING finger protein (MuRF-1), and myostatin (MSTN) (29.0 ± 11.2% 
to 84.3 ± 30.5%, vs. vehicle, P ≤ 0.05; P ≤ 0.01; P ≤ 0.001). Additionally, GRd 
scavenged ROS (91.7 ± 1.4% reduction at 1 nM, vs. vehicle, P ≤ 0.001), inhibited 
TNF-α-induced dysregulation of ROS level, and improved mitochondrial integrity 
(P ≤ 0.05; P ≤ 0.01; P ≤ 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: GRd ameliorates aging- and cancer-induced muscle wasting. Our 
findings suggest that GRd may be a novel therapeutic agent or adjuvant for 
reversing muscle wasting.

[Chemical pattern recognition of Atractylodes chinensis from different producing 
areas and establishment of quantitative analysis of multi-components by single 
marker (QAMS) method for four components].

This study established the fingerprint and combined it with chemical pattern 
recognition to evaluate the quality of Atractylodes chinensis samples from 
different producing areas and then employed the quantitative analysis of 
multi-components by single marker(QAMS) method to verify the feasibility and 
applicability of the established method in the quality evaluation of A. 
chinensis. The fingerprints of A. chinensis samples were constructed via high 
performance liquid chromatography(HPLC) to evaluate the inter-batch consistency. 
With the quality control component atractylodin as the internal reference, the 
relative correction factors(RCFs) were established for atractylenolide Ⅰ, 
atractylenolide Ⅲ, and β-eudesmol and the content of the four components was 
calculated. The external standard method was used to verify the accuracy of QAMS 
method. The quality of A. chinensis was further evaluated by similarity 
analysis, clustering analysis, and principal component analysis. The 
fingerprints of 13 batches of samples were calibrated with 21 common peaks, and 
4 common peaks were identified with the similarities all above 0.9. The RCFs 
established with atractylodin as the internal reference represented good 
reproducibility under different experimental conditions. Specifically, the RCFs 
of atractylenolide Ⅰ, atractylenolide Ⅲ, and β-eudesmol in A. chinensis were 
2.091, 4.253, and 6.010, respectively. QAMS and ESM showed no significant 
difference in the results, indicating that the QAMS method established in this 
study was stable and reliable. Thus, HPLC fingerprint combined with QAMS can be 
used for the quality evaluation of A. chinensis, providing a basis for 
comprehensive and rapid quality evaluation of A. chinensis.

HLA-DQA1∗05 Genotype and Immunogenicity to Tumor Necrosis Factor-α Antagonists: 
A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.

L(6), Boland BS(6), Syversen SW(7), Jørgensen KK(8), Ma C(9), Armuzzi A(10), 
Wilson A(11), Jairath V(12), Singh S(13).

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Identifying patients at high risk of immunogenicity is 
important when selecting tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α antagonists in patients 
with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs). We evaluated the association 
HLA-DQA1∗05 genotype and risk of immunogenicity with TNF-α antagonists.
METHODS: Through a systematic review through July 14, 2022, we identified 
studies in patients with IMIDs treated with TNF-α antagonists, which reported 
the risk of immunogenicity and/or secondary loss of response in patients with 
HLA-DQA1∗05 variants. Primary outcome was risk of immunogenicity. We performed 
random effects meta-analysis and used GRADE to appraise certainty of evidence.
RESULTS: On meta-analysis of 13 studies (3756 patients; median follow-up, 12 
months; 41% with variants), HLA-DQA1∗05 variants were associated with 75% higher 
risk of immunogenicity compared with non-carriers (relative risk, 1.75; 95% 
confidence interval, 1.37-2.25) with considerable heterogeneity (I2 = 62%) (low 
certainty evidence). Positive and negative predictive values of HLA-DQA1∗05 
variants for predicting immunogenicity were 30% and 80%, respectively. Proactive 
therapeutic drug monitoring, but not concomitant use of IMMs, IMIDs, and TNF-α 
antagonist-type, modified this association. Patients with HLA-DQA1∗05 variants 
experienced 2.2-fold higher risk of secondary loss of response (6 cohorts; 
relative risk, 2.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.67-3.00; I2 = 0%) (moderate 
certainty evidence).
CONCLUSION: Variants in HLA-DQA1∗05 are associated with an increased risk in 
immunogenicity and secondary loss of response in patients with IMIDs treated 
with TNF-α antagonists. However, the positive and negative predictive value is 
moderate, and decisions on concomitant use of IMMs to prevent immunogenicity 
should be individualized based on all factors that influence drug clearance.

Multi-level Force-dependent Allosteric Enhancement of αE-catenin Binding to 
F-actin by Vinculin.

Bax NA(1), Wang A(2), Huang DL(3), Pokutta S(4), Weis WI(5), Dunn AR(6).

Classical cadherins are transmembrane proteins whose extracellular domains link 
neighboring cells, and whose intracellular domains connect to the actin 
cytoskeleton via β-catenin and α-catenin. The cadherin-catenin complex transmits 
forces that drive tissue morphogenesis and wound healing. In addition, 
tension-dependent changes in αE-catenin conformation enables it to recruit the 
actin-binding protein vinculin to cell-cell junctions, which contributes to 
junctional strengthening. How and whether multiple cadherin-complexes cooperate 
to reinforce cell-cell junctions in response to load remains poorly understood. 
Here, we used single-molecule optical trap measurements to examine how multiple 
cadherin-catenin complexes interact with F-actin under load, and how this 
interaction is influenced by the presence of vinculin. We show that force 
oriented toward the (-) end of the actin filament results in mean lifetimes 
3-fold longer than when force was applied towards the barbed (+) end. We also 
measured force-dependent actin binding by a quaternary complex comprising the 
cadherin-catenin complex and the vinculin head region, which cannot itself bind 
actin. Binding lifetimes of this quaternary complex increased as additional 
complexes bound F-actin, but only when load was oriented toward the (-) end. In 
contrast, the cadherin-catenin complex alone did not show this form of 
cooperativity. These findings reveal multi-level, force-dependent regulation 
that enhances the strength of the association of multiple cadherin/catenin 
complexes with F-actin, conferring positive feedback that may strengthen the 
junction and polarize F-actin to facilitate the emergence of higher-order 
cytoskeletal organization.

Fenofibrate Downregulates NF-κB Signaling to Inhibit Pro-inflammatory Cytokine 
Secretion in Human THP-1 Macrophages and During Primary Biliary Cholangitis.

NS(4).

Chronic liver diseases, e.g., cholestasis, are negatively impacted by 
inflammation, which further aggravates liver injury. Pharmacotherapy targeting 
the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), e.g., fenofibrate, 
has recently become an off-label therapeutic option for patients with refractory 
cholestasis. Clinical studies show that fibrates can reduce some 
pro-inflammatory cytokines in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and primary 
sclerosing cholangitis (PSC); however, its anti-inflammatory mechanisms have not 
been established. Numerous cytokines are regulated by the transcription factor 
nuclear receptor kappa B (NF-κB), and PPARα has been shown to interfere with 
NF-κB signaling. This study investigates the anti-inflammatory mechanism of 
fenofibrate by inhibiting NF-κB signaling in human macrophages and clinical 
outcomes in patients with PBC. For adult patients with PBC and an incomplete 
biochemical response to ursodiol (13-15 mg/kg/day), the addition of fenofibrate 
(145-160 mg/day) reduced serum levels of TNF-α, IL-17A, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and 
MCP-1 and increased IL-10. In THP-1 cells, pretreatment with fenofibrate 
(125 μM) reduced LPS-stimulated peak concentrations of IL-1β (- 63%), TNF-α 
(- 88%), and IL-8 (- 54%), in a PPARα-dependent manner. Treatment with 
fenofibrate prior to LPS significantly decreased nuclear NF-κB p50 and p65 
subunit binding by 49% and 31%, respectively. Additionally, fenofibrate 
decreased nuclear NF-κB p50 and p65 protein expression by 66% and 55% and 
increased cytoplasmic levels by 53% and 54% versus LPS alone, respectively. 
Lastly, fenofibrate increased IκBα levels by 2.7-fold (p < 0.001) vs. LPS. These 
data demonstrate that fenofibrate reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines section by 
inhibiting in NF-κB signaling, which likely contribute to its anti-inflammatory 
effects during chronic liver diseases.

Synthesis and Evaluation of (68)Ga-Labeled 
(2S,4S)-4-Fluoropyrrolidine-2-Carbonitrile and (4R)-Thiazolidine-4-Carbonitrile 
Derivatives as Novel Fibroblast Activation Protein-Targeted PET Tracers for 
Cancer Imaging.

F(1)(2)(3), Lin KS(1)(2)(3).

Fibroblast activation protein α (FAP-α) is a cell-surface protein overexpressed 
on cancer-associated fibroblasts that constitute a substantial component of 
tumor stroma and drive tumorigenesis. FAP is minimally expressed by most healthy 
tissues, including normal fibroblasts. This makes it a promising pan-cancer 
diagnostic and therapeutic target. In the present study, we synthesized two 
novel tracers, [68Ga]Ga-SB03045 and [68Ga]Ga-SB03058, bearing a 
(2S,4S)-4-fluoropyrrolidine-2-carbonitrile or a (4R)-thiazolidine-4-carbonitrile 
pharmacophore, respectively. [68Ga]Ga-SB03045 and [68Ga]Ga-SB03058 were 
evaluated for their FAP-targeting capabilities using substrate-based in vitro 
binding assays, and in PET/CT imaging and ex vivo biodistribution studies in an 
HEK293T:hFAP tumor xenograft mouse model. The IC50 values of natGa-SB03045 (1.59 
± 0.45 nM) and natGa-SB03058 (0.68 ± 0.09 nM) were found to be lower than those 
of the clinically validated natGa-FAPI-04 (4.11 ± 1.42 nM). Contrary to the 
results obtained in the FAP-binding assay, [68Ga]Ga-SB03058 demonstrated a ~1.5 
fold lower tumor uptake than that of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 (7.93 ± 1.33 vs. 11.90 ± 
2.17 %ID/g), whereas [68Ga]Ga-SB03045 (11.8 ± 2.35 %ID/g) exhibited a tumor 
uptake comparable to that of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04. Thus, our data suggest that the 
(2S,4S)-4-fluoropyrrolidine-2-carbonitrile scaffold holds potential as a 
promising pharmacophore for the design of FAP-targeted radioligands for cancer 
diagnosis and therapy.

Replacement of the Alpha variant of SARS-CoV-2 by the Delta variant in Lebanon 
between April and June 2021.

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to expand globally, with case numbers rising in 
many areas of the world, including the Eastern Mediterranean Region. Lebanon 
experienced its largest wave of COVID-19 infections from January to April 2021. 
Limited genomic surveillance was undertaken, with just 26 SARS-CoV-2 genomes 
available for this period, nine of which were from travellers from Lebanon 
detected by other countries. Additional genome sequencing is thus needed to 
allow surveillance of variants in circulation. In total, 905 SARS-CoV-2 genomes 
were sequenced using the ARTIC protocol. The genomes were derived from 
SARS-CoV-2-positive samples, selected retrospectively from the sentinel COVID-19 
surveillance network, to capture diversity of location, sampling time, sex, 
nationality and age. Although 16 PANGO lineages were circulating in Lebanon in 
January 2021, by February there were just four, with the Alpha variant 
accounting for 97 % of samples. In the following 2 months, all samples contained 
the Alpha variant. However, this had changed dramatically by June and July 2021, 
when all samples belonged to the Delta variant. This study documents a ten-fold 
increase in the number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes available from Lebanon. The Alpha 
variant, first detected in the UK, rapidly swept through Lebanon, causing the 
country's largest wave to date, which peaked in January 2021. The Alpha variant 
was introduced to Lebanon multiple times despite travel restrictions, but the 
source of these introductions remains uncertain. The Delta variant was detected 
in Gambia in travellers from Lebanon in mid-May, suggesting community 
transmission in Lebanon several weeks before this variant was detected in the 
country. Prospective sequencing in June/July 2021 showed that the Delta variant 
had completely replaced the Alpha variant in under 6 weeks.

Endothelial Poldip2 regulates sepsis-induced lung injury via Rho pathway 
activation.

Dolmatova EV(1), Forrester SJ(1), Wang K(1), Ou Z(1), Williams HC(1), Joseph 
G(1), Kumar S(2), Valdivia A(1), Kowalczyk AP(3), Qu H(1), Jo H(2), Lassègue 
B(1), Hernandes MS(1), Griendling KK(1).

AIMS: Sepsis-induced lung injury is associated with significant morbidity and 
mortality. Previously, we showed that heterozygous deletion of polymerase 
δ-interacting protein 2 (Poldip2) was protective against sepsis-induced lung 
injury. Since endothelial barrier disruption is thought to be the main mechanism 
of sepsis-induced lung injury, we sought to determine if the observed protection 
was specifically due to the effect of reduced endothelial Poldip2.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Endothelial-specific Poldip2 knock-out mice (EC-/-) and 
their wild-type littermates (EC+/+) were injected with saline or 
lipopolysaccharide (18 mg/kg) to model sepsis-induced lung injury. At 18 h 
post-injection mice, were euthanized and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and 
lung tissue were collected to assess leucocyte infiltration. Poldip2 EC-/- mice 
showed reduced lung leucocyte infiltration in BAL (0.21 ± 0.9×106 vs. 1.29 ± 
1.8×106 cells/mL) and lung tissue (12.7 ± 1.8 vs. 23 ± 3.7% neutrophils of total 
number of cells) compared to Poldip2 EC+/+ mice. qPCR analysis of the lung 
tissue revealed a significantly dampened induction of inflammatory gene 
expression (TNFα 2.23 ± 0.39 vs. 4.15 ± 0.5-fold, IκBα 4.32 ± 1.53 vs. 8.97 ± 
1.59-fold), neutrophil chemoattractant gene expression (CXCL1 68.8 ± 29.6 vs. 
147 ± 25.7-fold, CXCL2 65 ± 25.6 vs. 215 ± 27.3-fold) and a marker of 
endothelial activation (VCAM1 1.25 ± 0.25 vs. 3.8 ± 0.38-fold) in Poldip2 EC-/- 
compared to Poldip2 EC+/+ lungs. An in vitro model using human pulmonary 
microvascular endothelial cells was used to assess the effect of Poldip2 
knock-down on endothelial activation and permeability. TNFα-induced endothelial 
permeability and VE-cadherin disruption were significantly reduced with 
siRNA-mediated knock-down of Poldip2 (5 ± 0.5 vs. 17.5 ± 3-fold for 
permeability, 1.5 ± 0.4 vs. 10.9 ± 1.3-fold for proportion of disrupted 
VE-cadherin). Poldip2 knock-down altered expression of Rho-GTPase-related genes, 
which correlated with reduced RhoA activation by TNFα (0.94 ± 0.05 vs. 1.29 ± 
0.01 of relative RhoA activity) accompanied by redistribution of active-RhoA 
staining to the centre of the cell.
CONCLUSION: Poldip2 is a potent regulator of endothelial dysfunction during 
sepsis-induced lung injury, and its endothelium-specific inhibition may provide 
clinical benefit.

Antihyperglycemic Properties of Extracts and Isolated Compounds from Australian 
Acacia saligna on 3T3-L1 Adipocytes.

Asmara AP(1), Prasansuklab A(2)(3), Chiabchalard A(2)(4), Chen H(5), Ung AT(1).

Our early work indicated that methanolic extracts from the flowers, leaves, 
bark, and isolated compounds of Acacia saligna exhibited significant antioxidant 
activities in vitro. The overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the 
mitochondria (mt-ROS) interfered with glucose uptake, metabolism, and its 
AMPK-dependent pathway, contributing to hyperglycemia and diabetes. This study 
aimed to screen the ability of these extracts and isolated compounds to 
attenuate the production of ROS and maintain mitochondrial function via the 
restoration of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. 
Downstream effects were investigated via an immunoblot analysis of the AMPK 
signalling pathway and glucose uptake assays. All methanolic extracts 
effectively reduced cellular ROS and mt-ROS levels, restored the MMP, activated 
AMPK-α, and enhanced cellular glucose uptake. At 10 µM, (-)-epicatechin-6 (from 
methanolic leaf and bark extracts) markedly reduced ROS and mt-ROS levels by 
almost 30% and 50%, respectively, with an MMP potential ratio 2.2-fold higher 
compared to the vehicle control. (-)-Epicatechin 6 increased the phosphorylation 
of AMPK-α by 43%, with an 88% higher glucose uptake than the control. Other 
isolated compounds include naringenin 1, naringenin-7-O-α-L-arabinopyranoside 2, 
isosalipurposide 3, D-(+)-pinitol 5a, and (-)-pinitol 5b, which also performed 
relatively well across all assays. Australian A. saligna active extracts and 
compounds can reduce ROS oxidative stress, improve mitochondrial function, and 
enhance glucose uptake through AMPK-α activation in adipocytes, supporting its 
potential antidiabetic application.

Amuc Prevents Liver Inflammation and Oxidative Stress in Mice Challenged with 
Salmonella Typhimurium.

Song Z(1), Si X(2), Zhang X(2), Chen J(3), Jia H(2), He Y(2), Liu H(2), Kou 
Z(2), Dai Z(2), Wu Z(4).

BACKGROUND: Salmonella typhimurium is a pathogen that causes gastroenteritis in 
humans and animals. Amuc_1100 (hereafter called Amuc), the outer membrane 
protein of Akkermansia muciniphila, alleviates metabolic disorders and maintains 
immune homeostasis.
OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to determine whether there is a protective 
effect of Amuc administration.
METHODS: Male 6-wk-old C57BL6J mice were randomly allocated into 4 groups: CON 
(control), Amuc (gavaged with Amuc, 100 μg/d for 14 d), ST (oral administration 
of 1.0 × 106 CFU S. typhimurium on day 7), and ST + Amuc (Amuc supplementation 
for 14 d, S. typhimurium administration on day 7). Serum and tissue samples were 
collected 14 d after treatment. Histological damage, inflammatory cell 
infiltration, apoptosis, and protein levels of genes associated with 
inflammation and antioxidant stress were analyzed. Data were analyzed by 2-way 
ANOVA and Duncan's multiple comparisons using SPSS software.
RESULTS: The ST group mice had 17.1% lower body weight, 1.3-3.6-fold greater 
organ index (organ weight/body weight for organs including the liver and 
spleen), 10-fold greater liver damage score, and 3.4-10.1-fold enhanced 
aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, and myeloperoxidase activities, 
and malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide concentrations compared with controls 
(P < 0.05). The S. typhimurium-induced abnormalities were prevented by Amuc 
supplementation. Furthermore, the ST + Amuc group mice had 1.44-1.89-fold lower 
mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin [Il]6, Il1b, and tumor 
necrosis factor-α) and chemokines (chemokine ligand [Ccl]2, Ccl3, and Ccl8) and 
27.1%-68.5% lower levels of inflammation-related proteins in the liver than ST 
group mice (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Amuc treatment prevents S. typhimurium-induced liver damage partly 
through the toll-like receptor (TLR)2/TLR4/myeloid differentiation factor 88 and 
nuclear factor-κB signaling as well as nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 
signaling pathways. Thus, Amuc supplementation may be effective in treating 
liver injury in S. typhimurium-challenged mice.

Exposure to a mixture of per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances modulates pulmonary 
expression of ACE2 and circulating hormones and cytokines.

Yang Z(1), Roth K(1), Ding J(2), Kassotis CD(3), Mor G(2), Petriello MC(4).

Genetic and environmental factors impact on the interindividual variability of 
susceptibility to communicable and non-communicable diseases. A class of 
ubiquitous chemicals, Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been 
linked in epidemiological studies to immunosuppression and increased 
susceptibility to viral infections, but possible mechanisms are not well 
elucidated. To begin to gain insight into the role of PFAS in susceptibility to 
one such viral infection, Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2), male and female C57BL/6 J mice were exposed to control water or a 
mixture of 5 PFAS (PFOS, PFOA, PFNA, PFHxS, Genx) for 12 weeks and lungs were 
isolated for examination of expression of SARS-CoV-2-related receptors 
Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and others. Secondary analyses included 
circulating hormones and cytokines which have been shown to directly or 
indirectly impact on ACE2 expression and severity of viral infections. Changes 
in mRNA and protein expression were analyzed by RT-qPCR and western blotting and 
circulating hormones and cytokines were determined by ELISA and MESO QuickPlex. 
The PFAS mixture decreased Ace2 mRNA 2.5-fold in male mice (p < 0.0001), with no 
significant change observed in females. In addition, TMPRSS2, ANPEP, ENPEP and 
DPP4 (other genes implicated in COVID-19 infection) were modulated due to PFAS. 
Plasma testosterone, but not estrogen were strikingly decreased due to PFAS 
which corresponded to PFAS-mediated repression of 4 representative pulmonary AR 
target genes; hemoglobin, beta adult major chain (Hbb-b1), Ferrochelatase 
(Fech), Collagen Type XIV Alpha 1 Chain (Col14a1), 5'-Aminolevulinate Synthase 2 
(Alas2). Finally, PFAS modulated circulating pro and anti-inflammatory mediators 
including IFN-γ (downregulated 3.0-fold in females; p = 0.0301, 2.1-fold in 
males; p = 0.0418) and IL-6 (upregulated 5.6-fold in males; p = 0.030, no change 
in females). In conclusion, our data indicate long term exposure to a PFAS 
mixture impacts mechanisms related to expression of ACE2 in the lung. This work 
provides a mechanistic rationale for important future studies of PFAS exposure 
and subsequent viral infection.

Machine learning and classical MD simulation to identify inhibitors against the 
P37 envelope protein of monkeypox virus.

Rout M(1), Dey S(2), Mishra S(1), Panda S(3), Singh MK(4), Sinha R(5), Dehury 
B(1), Pati S(1).

Monkeypox virus (MPXV) outbreak is a serious public health concern that requires 
international attention. P37 of MPXV plays a pivotal role in DNA replication and 
acts as one of the promising targets for antiviral drug design. In this study, 
we intent to screen potential analogs of existing FDA approved drugs of MPXV 
against P37 using state-of-the-art machine learning and computational 
biophysical techniques. AlphaFold2 guided all-atoms molecular dynamics 
simulations optimized P37 structure is used for molecular docking and binding 
free energy calculations. Similar to members of Phospholipase-D family , the 
predicted P37 structure also adopts a β-α-β-α-β sandwich fold, harbouring 
strongly conserved HxKxxxxD motif. The binding pocket comprises of Tyr48, Lys86, 
His115, Lys117, Ser130, Asn132, Trp280, Asn240, His325, Lys327 and Tyr346 
forming strong hydrogen bonds and dense hydrophobic contacts with the screened 
analogs and is surrounded by positively charged patches. Loops connecting the 
two domains and C-terminal region exhibit high degree of flexibility. In some 
structural ensembles, the partial disorderness in the C-terminal region is 
presumed to be due to its low confidence score, acquired during structure 
prediction. Transition from loop to β-strands (244-254 aa) in P37-Cidofovir and 
its analog complexes advocates the need for further investigations. MD 
simulations support the accuracy of the molecular docking results, indicating 
the potential of analogs as potent binders of P37. Taken together, our results 
provide preferable understanding of molecular recognition and dynamics of 
ligand-bound states of P37, offering opportunities for development of new 
antivirals against MPXV. However, the need of in vitro and in vivo assays for 
confirmation of these results still persists.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

Preclinical development of a novel Group B Streptococcus (GBS) vaccine candidate 
for maternal immunization based upon the alpha-like protein family of GBS 
surface proteins (Alp).

Banks C(1), Lindbom BJ(2), Kitson G(3), Darsley M(4), Fischer PB(2).

A novel Group B Streptococcus (GBS) vaccine, based upon the GBS alpha-like 
surface proteins, is being developed by MinervaX for administration to pregnant 
women. The vaccine is intended to generate antibodies (IgG) capable of crossing 
the placenta, in order to passively immunize the baby and provide protection in 
utero and up to 3 months after birth. An initial vaccine candidate, GBS-NN 
(based on the N-terminal domains of Rib and AlphaC surface proteins) was 
replaced, due to insufficient cross-reactivity with the two other N-terminal 
proteins (Alp1 and Alp2/3), by a modified vaccine candidate designated 
GBS-NN/NN2 that included all four AlpNs. Preclinical studies raised no safety 
concerns and the subsequent Phase I clinical trial demonstrated that the vaccine 
was well tolerated and strongly immunogenic. As the vaccine is intended for use 
during pregnancy for maternal immunization, an embryofetal study in rats and a 
fertility and embryofetal study in rabbits were performed, in both cases using 
GBS-NN/NN2. Vaccination of female rats or rabbits did not adversely affect 
embryofetal development or survival in either species, or mating or fertility in 
rabbits. In both studies, the pregnant animals developed immune responses to 
GBS-NN and GBS-NN2 proteins and concentrations of antibodies to both fusion 
proteins were detected in the fetuses and in the amniotic fluid. Data generated 
during these reproductive studies indicated a suitable safety margin 
(approximately 40-fold clinical dose) considered appropriate to support a 
subsequent human trial of GBS-NN/NN2 administered in the second and third 
trimesters of pregnancy.

Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs improve the cardiovascular profile in 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Giachi A(1), Cugno M(1)(2), Gualtierotti R(1)(2).

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting about 0. 
5-1% of the adult population and manifesting as persistent synovitis, systemic 
inflammation and production of autoantibodies. Patients affected by RA not only 
experience chronic disease progression, but are also burdened by a 1.5-fold 
increased cardiovascular (CV) risk, which is comparable to the risk experienced 
by patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. RA patients also have a higher 
incidence and prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD). Although RA patients 
frequently present traditional CV risk factors such as insulin resistance and 
active smoking, previous studies have clarified the pivotal role of chronic 
inflammation-driven by proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) 
and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)-in accelerating the process of 
atherosclerosis and impairing the coagulation system. Over the last years, a 
number of studies have shown that disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs 
(DMARDs) reducing the inflammatory state in general improve the CV risk, however 
some drugs may carry some apparent negative effects. Thus, RA is a model of 
disease in which targeting inflammation may counteract the progression of 
atherosclerosis and reduce CV risk. Clinical and experimental evidence indicates 
that the management of RA patients should be tailored based on the positive and 
negative effects of DMARDs on CV risk together with the individual traditional 
CV risk profile. The identification of genetic, biochemical and clinical 
biomarkers, predictive of evolution and response to treatment, will be the next 
challenge for a precision approach to reduce the burden of the disease.

Prumnopitys Andina Fruit Extract Activates Liver X Receptors after In Vitro 
Digestion.

Jiménez-Aspee F(1), Pospiech J(1), Bauer S(2), Sus N(1), Kufer TA(2), Frank 
J(1).

SCOPE: 20-Hydroxyecdysone (20E) is the main phytochemical present in the fresh 
arils of Prumnopitys andina. 20E is reported to have anabolic effects by 
modulation of gene transcription by interaction with nuclear receptors. Our aim 
is to evaluate the in vitro bioaccessibility, transepithelial transport of 20E, 
and the capacity of P. andina fruit extract and 20E to activate selected 
mammalian nuclear receptors in transiently transfected human cells after 
simulated gastrointestinal digestion.
RESULTS: 20E shows good stability, solubility, and micellization after in vitro 
digestion. 20E is taken up by Caco-2 cells, but poorly transported through the 
epithelial cell membrane, possibly due to P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux. In 
transiently transfected HepG2 cells, the fruit extract significantly induces the 
signal intensity for the liver X receptor (LXR)-α and -β by 1.6 and 1.4-fold, 
respectively. In contrast, the treatment with 20E, irrespective of its 
concentration, did not change the activity of both LXR receptors. No effects are 
observed for the pregnane X receptor or the constitutive androstane receptor.
CONCLUSION: Our findings show that components of the digested P. andina extract 
other than 20E are responsible for the effects on LXR-α and -β. Our findings 
open new perspectives on the potential role of P. andina fruits in cholesterol 
metabolism and inflammatory diseases.

Exploration the role of INHBA in Hu sheep granulosa cells using RNA-Seq.

Bao Y(1), Li X(1), El-Samahy MA(2), Yang H(1), Wang Z(1), Yang F(1), Yao X(1), 
Wang F(3).

Activin/inhibin is an important factor for the fecundity of Hu sheep, and it is 
involved in follicular development in ovaries. Inhibin subunit beta A (INHBA) 
participates in the synthesis of activin A and inhibin A. In this study, we also 
noted a positive correlation between INHBA level and the secretion of both 
activin A and inhibin A in culture medium. Nevertheless, both knockdown and 
overexpression of INHBA downregulated the expression of Inhibin Subunit Alpha 
(INHA). Based on RNA-Sequencing, we further examined the effect and molecular 
mechanism of INHBA knockdown in GCs on mRNA expression. A total of 1,687 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified (Fold change ≥ 2; 
False-discovory-rates (FDR) ≤ 0.01), of which 602 genes were upregulated and 
1,087 genes were downregulated in the INHBA interference group compared with the 
control groups. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment indicated that these DEGs were 
mainly involved in the regulation of cell cycle, protein serine/threonine kinase 
activity, and actin cytoskeleton reorganization. Moreover, DEGs were 
significantly enriched in 40 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) 
pathways, including P53, progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, and PI3K-AKT 
signaling pathways. We also noted a positive correlation between INHBA level and 
many PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway-related genes at the gene or/and protein expression. 
Overall, this study may contribute to a better understanding of the roles of 
INHBA on GCs of prolific sheep, as well as the molecular effect of low INHBA 
expression on GCs, clarifying some reproductive failures.

The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters C and G subfamilies have been 
reported to be involved in insecticide detoxification, with most studies showing 
increased gene transcript levels in response to insecticide exposure. Our 
previous studies have suggested that ABCC and G transporters participate in 
cyantraniliprole and thiamethoxam resistance of Aphis gossypii. In this study, 
we focused on the potential roles of the ABCC and G transporters of an A. 
gossypii field population (SDR) in neonicotinoid detoxification. The results of 
leaf dip bioassays showed 629.17- and 346.82-fold greater resistance to 
thiamethoxam and imidacloprid in the SDR strain, respectively, than in the 
susceptible strain (SS). Verapamil, an ABC inhibitor, was used for synergism 
bioassays, and the results showed synergistic effects with thiamethoxam, with 
synergistic ratios (SRs) of 2.07 and 6.68 in the SS and SDR strains, 
respectively. In addition to thiamethoxam, verapamil increased imidacloprid 
toxicity by 1.68- and 1.62-fold in the SS and SDR strains respectively. Then, 
the expression levels of several ABCC and G transporters were analyzed in 
different treatments. We found that the transcript levels of AgABCG4, AgABCG17, 
AgABCG26, AgMRP8 and AgMRP12 were higher in the SDR strain than in the SS 
strain. The mRNA expression of AgABCG4, AgABCG7, AgABCG13, AgABCG17, AgABCG26, 
AgMRP8 and AgMRP12 in the SDR strain was increased after thiamethoxam and 
imidacloprid exposure. The results of transgenic Drosophila melanogaster 
bioassays suggested that overexpression of AgABCG4, AgABCG7, AgABCG13, AgABCG17, 
AgABCG26, AgMRP8 and AgMRP12 in transgenic flies was sufficient to confer 
thiamethoxam and imidacloprid resistance, and AgABCG4, AgABCG7, AgABCG13, 
AgABCG26 and AgMRP12 may be related to α-cypermethrin cross-resistance with weak 
effects. In addition, the knockdown of AgABCG4, AgABCG13, AgABCG26, AgMRP8 and 
AgMRP12, and the knockdown of AgABCG7 and AgABCG26 increased thiamethoxam and 
imidacloprid mortality in the SDR strain, respectively. Our results suggest that 
changes in the expression levels of ABCC and G transporters may contribute to 
neonicotinoid detoxification in the SDR strain, and provide a foundation for 
clarify the potential roles of ABCC and G transporters in insecticide 
resistance.

Sequence Divergence in the Arginase Domain of Ornithine Decarboxylase/Arginase 
in Fusobacteriacea Leads to Loss of Function in Oral Associated Species.

Mothersole RG(1), Kolesnikov M(2), Chan ACK(2), Oduro E(1), Murphy MEP(2), 
Wolthers KR(1).

A number of species within the Fusobacteriaceae family of Gram-negative bacteria 
uniquely encode for an ornithine decarboxylase/arginase (ODA) that ostensibly 
channels l-ornithine generated by hydrolysis of l-arginine to putrescine 
formation. However, two aspartate residues required for coordination to a 
catalytically obligatory manganese cluster of arginases are substituted for a 
serine and an asparagine. Curiously, these natural substitutions occur only in a 
clade of Fusobacterium species that inhabit the oral cavity. Herein, we 
expressed and isolated full-length ODA from the opportunistic oral pathogen 
Fusobacterium nucleatum along with the individual arginase and ornithine 
decarboxylase components. The crystal structure of the arginase domain reveals 
that it adopts the classical α/β arginase-fold, but metal ions are absent in the 
active site. As expected, the ureohydrolase activity with l-arginine was not 
detected for wild-type ODA or the isolated arginase domain. However, engineering 
of the complete metal coordination environment through site-directed mutagenesis 
restored Mn2+ binding capacity and arginase activity, although the catalytic 
efficiency for l-arginine was low (60-100 M-1 s-1). Full-length ODA and the 
isolated ODC component were able to decarboxylate both l-ornithine and 
l-arginine to form putrescine and agmatine, respectively, but kcat/KM of 
l-ornithine was ∼20-fold higher compared to l-arginine. We discuss environmental 
conditions that may have led to the natural selection of an inactive arginase in 
the oral associated species of Fusobacterium.

The Effect of Exosomes Derived from Unrestricted Somatic Stem Cells on Murine 
Model of Sepsis.

Akhavan Rahnama M(1), Soufi Zomorrod M(2), Abroun S(2), Atashi A(3).

Sepsis is a systemic infection mainly caused by bacterial infections. Despite 
all efforts and advances in the treatment of sepsis, it is still considered one 
of the leading causes of death in hospitalized patients. Today, we have to use 
novel therapies and one of the most important is cell-free therapy. Exosomes 
have been shown to contain the contents of their parent cells and that they do 
not generate an immune response between different individuals which makes them a 
good candidate for transplantation. Unrestricted somatic stem cells (USSC), also 
known as mesenchymal stem cell progenitors due to their high proliferative 
capacity and low immune response, may be a novel therapy for sepsis. In this 
study, the effect of USSC-derived exosomes on sepsis was investigated using a 
mouse model. USSCs were isolated from human cord blood and characterized by flow 
cytometry and multi-lineage differentiation. The exosomes were then harvested 
from USSCs and characterized by transmission electron microscopy, Western 
blotting, and dynamic light scattering. The harvested exosomes were injected 
into the mouse model of sepsis. Biochemical, histological, molecular, and 
survival studies were performed in different groups. Our observations showed 
that USSC-derived exosomes can reduce inflammation in septic mice. 
Histopathologic and biochemical findings in the sham group showed multiorgan 
involvement, but these changes disappeared after 7 days of exosome 
administration. Moreover, the expression of IRAK-1 and TRAF-6 (main adapter 
molecules in signaling pathways of inflammation) was decreased through negative 
regulation by miR-146a after 72 h of exosome administration. A 2-fold increase 
in the level of IL-10 and a 2-fold decrease in the levels of IL-6 and TNF-α was 
observed. In conclusion, we showed that direct injection of USSC-derived 
exosomes can be one of the important methods for the treatment of various 
aspects of sepsis due to their immunomodulatory properties.

Sexual, physical, and overall adverse effects in patients treated with 
5α-reductase inhibitors: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Zhang JJ(1)(2), Shi X(3), Wu T(4), Zhang MD(1)(2), Tang J(1), Yin GM(1), Long 
Z(1), He LY(1), Qi L(2), Wang L(1).

Postfinasteride syndrome (PFS) is a term coined to characterize a constellation 
of reported undesirable sexual, physical, and neuropsychiatric side effects. In 
the present study, we conducted the meta-analysis to demonstrate whether the use 
of 5α-reductase inhibitors (5ARIs) increases the risk of PFS-like adverse 
effects. A search of studies published until May 10, 2020, was performed using 
PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. We included randomized controlled 
trials with at least one comparison between male patients receiving 5ARIs versus 
placebo for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or androgenetic 
alopecia (AGA), and identified 34 studies from 28 articles that met our 
eligibility criteria. In the random-effects model, the overall use of 5ARIs 
exhibited a 1.87-fold risk of PFS-like adverse effects during the trial (95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 1.64-2.14). Regarding specific types of adverse 
effects, the use of 5ARIs had a 1.89-fold risk of sexual adverse effects (95% 
CI: 1.74-2.05) and was associated with an increased risk of physical adverse 
effects (relative risk [RR]: 1.31, 95% CI: 0.80-2.15), albeit without 
statistical significance. This meta-analysis helped to better define the adverse 
effects caused by 5ARIs. We concluded that the overall use of 5ARIs 
significantly increased the risk of PFS-like adverse effects in men with AGA or 
BPH during treatment. Enhanced awareness of and education on the PFS-like 
adverse effects are necessary for clinicians.

Effect of GuttaClear on Postoperative Pain After Root Canal Retreatment: A 
Randomized Clinical Trial.

Sirijindamai D(1), Wichai W(2), Mitrirattanakul S(3), Jantarat J(1).

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate postoperative pain after 
non-surgical root canal retreatment with or without GuttaClear.
METHODS: Sixty participants were randomly distributed in this non-inferiority 
trial into two parallel singleblinded experimental groups (Group1: non-solvent, 
Group2: solvent). After root canal retreatment, the participants completed 
questionnaires using direct (numerical rating scales) and indirect (number of 
analgesics taken) measurements of postoperative pain at immediate, 6, 12, 24, 
48, and 72 h post-retreatment. The predisposing postoperative pain factors were 
recorded and analysed using Generalized Estimating Equations to identify 
correlated factors (α=0.05).
RESULTS: The pain incidence was not significantly different between the groups 
at any time point. The highest incidence of postoperative pain occurred 
immediately after retreatment (35%) and then decreased to 15% at 24 h (P<0.05). 
The number of participants requiring analgesics was 6.67% in the non-solvent 
group and 9.99% in the solvent group which were similar between the groups. 
Patients with a history of previous postoperative pain were 21.6-fold more 
likely to have postoperative pain than those without (P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: There was no difference in postoperative pain or analgesics required 
after root canal retreatment with or without using GuttaClear. This study is 
registered in ClinicalTrial.gov (NCT04326998). (EEJ-2022-05-069).

Metal-binding and circular permutation-dependent thermodynamic and kinetic 
stability of azurin.

Das D(1), Yadav P(1), Mitra S(1), Ainavarapu SRK(1).

Native topology is known to determine the folding kinetics and the energy 
landscape of proteins. Furthermore, the circular permutation (CP) of proteins 
alters the order of the secondary structure connectivity while retaining the 
three-dimensional structure, making it an elegant and powerful approach to 
altering native topology. Previous studies elucidated the influence of CP in 
proteins with different folds such as Greek key β-barrel, β-sandwich, β-α-β, and 
all α-Greek key. CP mainly affects the protein stability and unfolding kinetics, 
while folding kinetics remains mostly unaltered. However, the effect of CP on 
metalloproteins is yet to be elaborately studied. The active site of 
metalloproteins poses an additional complexity in studying protein folding. 
Here, we investigate a CP variant (cpN42) of azurin-in both metal-free and 
metal-bound (holo) forms. As observed earlier in other proteins, apo-forms of 
wild-type (WT) and cpN42 fold with similar rates. In contrast, zinc-binding 
accelerates the folding of WT but decelerates the folding of cpN42. On 
zinc-binding, the spontaneous folding rate of WT increases by >250 times that of 
cpN42, which is unprecedented and the highest for any CP to date. On the other 
hand, zinc-binding reduces the spontaneous unfolding rate of cpN42 by ~100 
times, making the WT and CP azurins unfold at similar rates. Our study 
demonstrates metal binding as a novel way to modulate the unfolding and folding 
rates of CPs compared to their WT counterparts. We hope our study increases the 
understanding of the effect of CP on the folding mechanism and energy landscape 
of metalloproteins.

Nurses' professional values scale‒three: Validation and psychometric appraisal 
among Saudi undergraduate student nurses.

Alsufyani AM(1), Aboshaiqah AE(1), Alshehri FA(1)(2), Alsufyani YM(3).

OBJECTIVES: Since the nursing professional values have garnered attention as a 
principal criterion for safe‒quality nursing practice, it was measured using the 
Nurses Professional Values Scale‒three. We aimed to validate and ascertain the 
psychometric indicators of the Arabic version of the Nurses Professional Values 
Scale-three among Saudi student nurses.
METHOD: This methodological study recruited student nurses using convenience 
sampling from two nursing colleges at KSA. About 438 valid questionnaires were 
returned out of 500 questionnaires which were distributed over students in a 
formal day class time; representing a response rate of 87.6%. A 2‒fold 
cross‒validation process was adopted. A transcultural process was conducted. 
Face, content, and construct validity using exploratory and confirmatory factor 
analyses were used. Convergent and discriminant validity were also assessed. The 
reliability of the scale was assessed using Cronbach's alpha.
RESULTS: Face validity was achieved. The content validity of items ranged from 
.83 to 1.00, while it was .96 for the overall scale. The exploratory factor 
analysis yielded a scale containing 28 items with a three‒factor model, 
explaining 74.5% of the total variance. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed 
that three‒factor solution had an adequate model fit (CMIN/df = 1.98; 
RMSEA = .065; SRMR = .039, CFI = .972, and GFI = .968). Convergent validity and 
discriminant validity were achieved. Cronbach's alpha values were .89, .90, .90, 
and .96 for activism, caring, professionalism, and the overall scale, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Adequate levels of reliability and validity of the Arabic version of 
the Nurses Professional Values Scale-three were established, indicating the 
appropriateness of using this version to assess the professional values among 
Saudi and other Arabic‒speaking nurses.

Design and Pharmacological Chaperone Effects of N-(4'-Phenylbutyl)-DAB 
Derivatives Targeting the Lipophilic Pocket of Lysosomal Acid α-Glucosidase.

Kato A(1), Nakagome I(2), Kise M(1), Yoshimura K(1), Tanaka N(2), Nash RJ(3), 
Fleet GWJ(4), Kobayashi Y(5), Ikeda H(6), Okada T(5)(6), Toyooka N(5)(6).

This study provides the first example of a strategy to design a practical ligand 
toward lysosomal acid α-glucosidase (GAA) focusing on N-alkyl derivatives of 
1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-d-arabinitol (DAB). The optimized 
N-4'-(p-trifluoromethylphenyl)butyl-DAB (5g) showed a Ki value of 0.73 μM, which 
was 353-fold higher affinity than N-butyl-DAB (3f) without a terminal phenyl 
group. Docking analysis showed that the phenyl part of 5g was accommodated in a 
lipophilic pocket. Furthermore, the p-trifluoromethyl group effectively 
suppresses the fluctuation of the phenyl group, allowing it to produce a stable 
bonding form with GAA. 5g increased the midpoint of the protein's protein 
denaturation temperature (Tm) by 6.6 °C above that in the absence of the ligand 
and acted as a "thermodynamic stabilizer" to improve the thermal stability of 
rhGAA. 5g dose-dependently increased intracellular GAA activities in Pompe 
patient's fibroblasts with the M519V mutation; its effect was comparable to that 
of DNJ, which is under clinical trials.

Identification of a covert evolutionary pathway between two protein folds.

Chakravarty D(1), Sreenivasan S(2), Swint-Kruse L(2), Porter LL(3)(4).

Although homologous protein sequences are expected to adopt similar structures, 
some amino acid substitutions can interconvert α-helices and β-sheets. Such fold 
switching may have occurred over evolutionary history, but supporting evidence 
has been limited by the: (1) abundance and diversity of sequenced genes, (2) 
quantity of experimentally determined protein structures, and (3) assumptions 
underlying the statistical methods used to infer homology. Here, we overcome 
these barriers by applying multiple statistical methods to a family of ~600,000 
bacterial response regulator proteins. We find that their homologous DNA-binding 
subunits assume divergent structures: helix-turn-helix versus α-helix + β-sheet 
(winged helix). Phylogenetic analyses, ancestral sequence reconstruction, and 
AlphaFold2 models indicate that amino acid substitutions facilitated a switch 
from helix-turn-helix into winged helix. This structural transformation likely 
expanded DNA-binding specificity. Our approach uncovers an evolutionary pathway 
between two protein folds and provides a methodology to identify secondary 
structure switching in other protein families.

Highly sensitive paper-based immunoassay: Combining nanomaterials modified 
cellulose with covalent and oriented immobilization of antibody.

Chen Y(1), Xu A(1), Li J(2), Zhu X(3), Zou M(4), Liu S(5).

Among the analytical tools, paper-based analytical devices (PADs) have become a 
leading alternative for point-of care testing (POCT). In this study, PADs were 
fabricated using an office laser printer. Then, the paper zone was modified with 
graphene oxide (GO) and pyrene derivatives, which provide a sufficient amount of 
carboxylic groups for conjugating antibodies. At an optimal pH, antibodies were 
covalently bound onto carboxylated cellulose surface in an oriented manner 
through a two-step strategy: electrostatic adsorption was followed by EDC/NHS 
coupling. α-fetoprotein (AFP) as a detection model, we compared with cellulose 
powder modified and unmodified paper zone. The results showed the color 
intensity and color uniformity on GO modified paper was improved. The activity 
of immobilized antibodies on GO/1-pyrenebutyric acid (GO/PBA) modified was three 
times higher than that of GO modified and about 1.8-fold higher than that of 
GO/1-pyrenecarboxylic acid (GO/PCA) modified. The GO/PBA modified paper-based 
immunoassay has enhanced sensitivity and low detection limit. A linear 
correlation between color intensity and concentration of AFP in the range of 
0.01～16.5 ng mL-1 with a detection limit of 9.0 pg mL-1 were achieved, 
respectively. The obtained results point towards rapid, sensitive, and specific 
early diagnosis of liver cancer at the point of care and other low-resource 
settings.

Anti-tyrosinase flavone derivatives and their anti-melanogenic activities: 
Importance of the β-phenyl-α,β-unsaturated carbonyl scaffold.

D(1), Hong S(1), Kang D(4), Park Y(4), Chun P(5), Young Chung H(2), Ryong Moon 
H(6).

Flavone derivatives were designed and synthesized based on the hypothesis that 
flavones containing the β-phenyl-α,β-unsaturated carbonyl (PUSC) scaffold have 
potential anti-tyrosinase activity. Flavones 1a and 1e inhibited mushroom 
tyrosinase more potently than kojic acid, and 1e inhibited monophenolase and 
diphenolase 61- and 28-fold more than kojic acid, respectively. Kinetic studies 
on mushroom tyrosinase indicated that 1a and 1e competitively inhibit 
monophenolase and diphenolase, and docking results supported these results. In 
an in vitro assay using B16F10 murine cells, 1a and 1e inhibited melanin 
production more potently than kojic acid, and this was attributed to the 
inhibition of tyrosinase. Furthermore, 1a and 1e strongly scavenged DPPH and 
ABTS radicals and ROS, which suggested that their antioxidant properties were at 
least partly responsible for their anti-melanogenic effects. Moreover, flavone 
1a also inhibited the gene expressions of the melanogenesis-related genes 
tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein (TRP)-1, and TRP-2. Our findings that 
flavone derivatives (i) directly inhibit tyrosinase, (ii) act as antioxidants, 
and (iii) inhibit the expressions of melanogenesis-related genes suggest their 
potential use as natural melanogenesis inhibitors. Furthermore, the study 
confirms that the PUSC scaffold confers anti-tyrosinase activity.

Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor α Has a Protective Effect on Fatty 
Liver Caused by Excessive Sucrose Intake.

Yamazaki T(1), Ihato M(1).

Sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-1c is a transcription factor 
that regulates lipid synthesis from glucose in the liver. It is activated by 
sucrose, which activates the fatty acid synthesis pathway. On the other hand, 
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α regulates the transcription 
of several genes encoding enzymes involved in fatty acid β-oxidation in the 
liver. To evaluate the beneficial effects of PPARα on fatty liver caused by 
excessive sucrose intake, we investigated the molecular mechanisms related to 
the development of fatty liver in PPARα-deficient mice that were fed a 
high-sucrose diet (Suc). The SREBP-1c target gene expression was increased by 
sucrose intake, leading to the development of fatty liver. Furthermore, PPARα-/- 
mice developed severe fatty liver. Male and female PPARα-/- mice fed Suc showed 
3.7- and 3.1-fold higher liver fat content than Suc-fed male and female 
wild-type mice, respectively. Thus, PPARα may work to prevent the development of 
fatty liver caused by excessive sucrose intake. Liver TG accumulation differed 
between male and female PPARα-/- mice. A possible explanation is that male mice 
show the increased expression of Pparγ, which usually contributes to 
triglyceride synthesis in the liver, to compensate for Pparα deficiency. In 
contrast, female wild-type mice inherently have low Pparα levels. Thus, Pparα 
deficiency has less pronounced effects in female mice. A diet that activates 
PPARα may be effective for preventing the development of fatty liver due to 
excessive sucrose intake.

The involvement of commensals and opportunistic pathogens and the role of 
protective mechanisms in the development of dental diseases in children with 
cystic fibrosis require more detailed study.
AIM: The aim of the study was to determine the ecological characteristics of the 
oral microbiota and some antimicrobial factors of saliva in children with 
mucoviscidosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study involved an assessment of oral microbiota as 
complex ecological system that protects the human body from colonization by 
pathogenic flora in children with cystic fibrosis. Bacteriological studies have 
been performed on clinical material from 30 children with mucoviscidosis 
diagnosed with dental and periodontal diseases.
RESULTS: In the microbiological study of plaque microbiota, 70 strains of 
opportunistic pathogens were isolated in patients with mucoviscidosis. The most 
significant were alpha-hemolytic Streptococci (40%). The proportion of bacteria 
of Neisseria genus in patients with cystic fibrosis was lower and amounted to 
24.3%. C. albicans fungi were isolated in comparable values (18.5%), S. aureus 
(8.5%), as well as gram-negative strains of E. aerogenes (4.3%) and E. coli 
(4.3%) significantly dominated. The results indicate that opportunistic 
pathogens S. aureus, E. aerogenes and E. coli partially replaced the 
representatives of the normal oral microbiota alpha-hemolytic streptococci and 
non-pathogenic species of Neisseria genus in patients with mucoviscidosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Microbiota of plaque in children with mucoviscidosis is 
characterized by an expansion of the spectrum of opportunistic pathogens due to 
Staphylococcus aureus, enterobacteria and C. albicans fungi, which indicates a 
violation of the microbiocenosis due to reduced mucosal immunity. Mucosal 
immunity of the oral cavity in children with mucoviscidosis is characterized by 
a 1.5-fold decrease in lysozyme activity and the level of secretory IgA in the 
saliva of children.

The BACH1 inhibitor ASP8731 inhibits inflammation and vaso-occlusion and induces 
fetal hemoglobin in sickle cell disease.

In sickle cell disease (SCD), heme released during intravascular hemolysis 
promotes oxidative stress, inflammation, and vaso-occlusion. Conversely, free 
heme can also activate expression of antioxidant and globin genes. Heme binds to 
the transcription factor BACH1, which represses NRF2-mediated gene 
transcription. ASP8731, is a selective small molecule inhibitor of BACH1. We 
investigated the ability of ASP8731 to modulate pathways involved in SCD 
pathophysiology. In HepG2 liver cells, ASP8731 increased HMOX1 and FTH1 mRNA. In 
pulmonary endothelial cells, ASP8731 decreased VCAM1 mRNA in response to TNF-α 
and blocked a decrease in glutathione in response to hemin. Townes-SS mice were 
gavaged once per day for 4 weeks with ASP8731, hydroxyurea (HU) or vehicle. Both 
ASP8731 and HU inhibited heme-mediated microvascular stasis and in combination, 
ASP8731 significantly reduced microvascular stasis compared to HU alone. In 
Townes-SS mice, ASP8731 and HU markedly increased heme oxygenase-1 and decreased 
hepatic ICAM-1, NF-kB phospho-p65 protein expression in the liver, and white 
blood cell counts. In addition, ASP8731 increased gamma-globin expression and 
HbF+ cells (F-cells) as compared to vehicle-treated mice. In human erythroid 
differentiated CD34+ cells, ASP8731 increased HGB mRNA and increased the 
percentage of F-cells 2-fold in manner similar to HU. ASP8731 and HU when given 
together induced more HbF+ cells compared to either drug alone. In CD34+ cells 
from one donor that was non-responsive to HU, ASP8731 induced HbF+ cells 
~2-fold. ASP8731 and HU also increased HBG and HBA, but not HBB mRNA in 
erythroid differentiated CD34+ cells derived from SCD patients. These data 
indicate that BACH1 may offer a new therapeutic target to treat SCD.

Genome-wide analysis of bromodomain gene family in Arabidopsis and rice.

Abiraami TV(1), Sanyal RP(1), Misra HS(1)(2), Saini A(1)(2).

The bromodomain-containing proteins (BRD-proteins) belongs to family of 
'epigenetic mark readers', integral to epigenetic regulation. The BRD-members 
contain a conserved 'bromodomain' (BRD/BRD-fold: interacts with 
acetylated-lysine in histones), and several additional domains, making them 
structurally/functionally diverse. Like animals, plants also contain multiple 
Brd-homologs, however the extent of their diversity and impact of molecular 
events (genomic duplications, alternative splicing, AS) therein, is relatively 
less explored. The present genome-wide analysis of Brd-gene families of 
Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa showed extensive diversity in structure of 
genes/proteins, regulatory elements, expression pattern, domains/motifs, and the 
bromodomain (w.r.t. length, sequence, location) among the Brd-members. Orthology 
analysis identified thirteen ortholog groups (OGs), three paralog groups (PGs) 
and four singleton members (STs). While more than 40% Brd-genes were affected by 
genomic duplication events in both plants, AS-events affected 60% A. thaliana 
and 41% O. sativa genes. These molecular events affected various regions 
(promoters, untranslated regions, exons) of different Brd-members with potential 
impact on expression and/or structure-function characteristics. RNA-Seq data 
analysis indicated differences in tissue-specificity and stress response of 
Brd-members. Analysis by RT-qPCR revealed differential abundance and salt stress 
response of duplicate A. thaliana and O. sativa Brd-genes. Further analysis of 
AtBrd gene, AtBrdPG1b showed salinity-induced modulation of splicing pattern. 
Bromodomain (BRD)-region based phylogenetic analysis placed the A. thaliana and 
O. sativa homologs into clusters/sub-clusters, mostly consistent with 
ortholog/paralog groups. The bromodomain-region displayed several conserved 
signatures in key BRD-fold elements (α-helices, loops), along with variations 
(1-20 sites) and indels among the BRD-duplicates. Homology modeling and 
superposition identified structural variations in BRD-folds of divergent and 
duplicate BRD-members, which might affect their interaction with the chromatin 
histones, and associated functions. The study also showed contribution of 
various duplication events in Brd-gene family expansion among diverse plants, 
including several monocot and dicot plant species.

Lycopene Scavenges Cellular ROS, Modulates Autophagy and Improves Survival 
through 7SK snRNA Interaction in Smooth Muscle Cells.

Shati AA(1), Eid RA(2), Zaki MSA(3)(4), Alqahtani YA(1), Al-Qahtani SM(1), 
Chandramoorthy HC(5)(6)(7).

The chance of survival rate and autophagy of smooth muscle cells under calcium 
stress were drastically improved with a prolonged inclusion of Lycopene in the 
media. The results showed an improved viability from 41% to 69% and a reduction 
in overall autophagic bodies from 7% to 3%, which was well in agreement with the 
LC3II and III mRNA levels. However, the proliferation was slow compared to the 
controls. The fall in the major inflammatory marker TNF-α and improved 
antioxidant enzyme GPx were regarded as significant restoration markers of cell 
survival. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) were reduced from 8 fold to 3 fold 
post addition of lycopene for 24 h. Further, the docking studies revealed 
binding of lycopene molecules with 7SK snRNA at 7.6 kcal/mol docking energy with 
300 ns stability under physiological conditions. Together, these results suggest 
that Lycopene administration during ischemic heart disease might improve the 
functions of the smooth muscle cells and 7SK snRNA might be involved in the 
binding of lycopene and its antioxidant protective effects.

Effects of an enzyme agent containing mutanase and dextranase for treatment of 
biofilms in bacteria- and yeast-infected canine otitis externa.

Fujimura M(1).

The purpose of this study was to evaluate in detail both the in vivo and in 
vitro efficacy of the enzyme agents, ZYMOX® Plus Otic (ZYMOX-P), in the 
treatment of canine otitis externa (OE). Eight dogs with a diagnosis of 
non-seasonal severe chronic OE were recruited for the study. ZYMOX-P was 
administered for 2-4 weeks. The Otitis Index Score (OTIS3) and bacteria or yeast 
colony growth were measured. Also, minimum biofilm (BF) formation inhibition 
concentration (MBIC) and BF bactericidal concentration (BBC) were measured in 
vitro. OTIS3 showed a statistically significant reduction after treatment 
(88.2%, p⟨0.001; pre-treatment = 11.0 ± 0.9; post-treatment = 1.3 ± 0.4, mean ± 
SEM). The individual OTIS scores, erythema, edema, erosions/ ulcerations, 
exudate and pruritus showed significant reduction (85.7%, 95.7%, 83.3%, 80.0%, 
and 89.3%, respectively). Microscopic examination revealed the presence of BF 
exopolysaccharide in all 8 ear samples when stained with alcian blue. Seven of 
the 8 dogs (87.5%) showed a reduction in colony growth. ZYMOX-P was effective at 
34-fold and 16-fold dilutions on MBIC and BBC, respectively. These findings 
indicate that ZYMOX-P has efficacy against BF-related infection and is 
beneficial when used for the management of canine OE.

Tandem mass tag-based quantitative proteomics analyses of a chicken-original 
virulent and its attenuated Histomonas meleagridis strain in China.

Chen QG(1)(2), Zhang YM(1)(2), Chen C(1)(2), Wang S(1)(2), Li ZF(1)(2), Hou 
ZF(1)(2), Liu DD(1)(2), Tao JP(1)(2), Xu JJ(1)(2).

INTRODUCTION: Histomonas meleagridis can cause histomonosis in poultry. Due to 
the prohibition of effective drugs, the prevention and treatment of the disease 
requires new strategies. Questions about its pathogenic mechanisms and virulence 
factors remain puzzling.
METHODS: To address these issues, a tandem mass tag (TMT) comparative proteomic 
analysis of a virulent strain and its attenuated strain of Chinese 
chicken-origin was performed.
RESULTS: A total of 3,494 proteins were identified in the experiment, of which 
745 proteins were differentially expressed (fold change ≥1.2 or ≤0.83 and p < 
0.05), with 192 up-regulated proteins and 553 down-regulated proteins in the 
virulent strain relative to the attenuated strain.
DISCUSSION: Surface protein BspA like, digestive cysteine proteinase, actin, and 
GH family 25 lysozyme were noted among the proteins up regulated in virulent 
strains, and these several proteins may be directly related to the pathogenic 
capacity of the histomonad. Ferredoxin, 60S ribosomal protein L6, 40S ribosomal 
protein S3, and NADP-dependent malic enzyme which associated with biosynthesis 
and metabolism were also noted, which have the potential to be new drug targets. 
The up-regulation of alpha-amylase, ras-like protein 1, ras-like protein 2, and 
involucrin in attenuated strains helps to understand how it is adapted to the 
long-term in vitro culture environment. The above results provide some candidate 
protein-coding genes for further functional verification, which will help to 
understand the molecular mechanism of pathogenicity and attenuation of H. 
meleagridis more comprehensively.

Fabrication and evaluation of agarose-curdlan blend derived multifunctional 
nanofibrous mats for diabetic wounds.

Latiyan S(1), Kumar TSS(2), Doble M(3).

Diabetic wounds with complex pathophysiology significantly burden the wound care 
industry and require novel management strategies. In the present study, we 
hypothesized that agarose-curdlan based nanofibrous dressings could be an 
effective biomaterial for addressing diabetic wounds due to their inherent 
healing properties. Hence, agarose/curdlan/polyvinyl alcohol based nanofibrous 
mats loaded with ciprofloxacin (0, 1, 3, and 5 wt%) were fabricated using an 
electrospinning technique with water and formic acid. In vitro evaluation 
revealed the average diameter of the fabricated nanofibers between 115 and 
146 nm with high swelling (~450-500 %) properties. They exhibited enhanced 
mechanical strength (7.46 ± 0.80 MPa -7.79 ± 0.007 MPa) and significant 
biocompatibility (~90-98 %) with L929 and NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts. In vitro 
scratch assay showed higher proliferation and migration of fibroblasts 
(~90-100 % wound closure) compared to electrospun PVA and control. Significant 
antibacterial activity was observed against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus 
aureus. In vitro real-time gene expression studies with human THP-1 cell line 
revealed a significant downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (8.64 fold 
decrease for TNF-α) and upregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines (6.83 fold 
increase for IL-10) compared to lipopolysaccharide. In brief, the results 
advocate agarose-curdlan mat as a potential multifunctional, bioactive, and 
eco-friendly dressing for healing diabetic wounds.

The Effect of TGFβ1 in Adipocyte on Inflammatory and Fibrotic Markers at 
Different Stages of Adipocyte Differentiation.

Maharjan BR(1)(2), McLennan SV(1)(3), Twigg SM(1)(4), Williams PF(1).

Transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) is a versatile cytokine. Although a 
profibrotic role of TGFβ is well established, its effect on tissue inhibitor of 
metalloproteinase (TIMPs) and inflammatory mediators are incompletely described. 
This study investigates the profibrotic and pro-inflammatory role of TGFβ1 
during adipocyte differentiation. NIH3T3L1 cells were used for the in vitro 
study and were differentiated by adding a standard differentiation mix either 
with rosiglitazone (R-Diff) or without (S-Diff). Recombinant TGFβ1 (2 ng/mL) was 
added to the undifferentiated preadipocyte during the commitment stage and at 
the terminal differentiation stage. TGFβ1 treatment significantly decreased 
adiponectin mRNA at both early commitment (>300 fold) and terminal 
differentiated cells [S-Diff (~33%) or R-Diff (~20%)]. TGFβ1 upregulated 
collagen VI mRNA and its regulators connective tissue growth factor (CCN2/CTGF), 
TIMP1 and TIMP3 mRNA levels in undifferentiated preadipocytes and adipocytes at 
commitment stage. But in the terminal differentiated adipocytes, changes in mRNA 
and protein of collagen VI and TIMP3 mRNA were not observed despite an increase 
in CCN2/CTGF, TIMP1 mRNA. Although TGFβ1 upregulated interleukin-6 (IL6) and 
monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1) mRNA at all stages of differentiation, 
decreased tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) mRNA was observed early in adipocyte 
differentiation. This study highlights the complex role of TGFβ1 on 
extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and inflammatory markers in stimulating 
both synthetic and inhibitory markers of fibrosis at different stages of 
adipocyte differentiation.

Inhibition of α(1)-Adrenergic, Non-Adrenergic and Neurogenic Human Prostate 
Smooth Muscle Contraction and of Stromal Cell Growth by the Isoflavones 
Genistein and Daidzein.

Huang R(1), Liu Y(1), Hu S(1), Tamalunas A(1), Waidelich R(1), Strittmatter 
F(1), Stief CG(1), Hennenberg M(1).

Isoflavone-rich legumes, including soy, are used for food production, as dietary 
supplements and in traditional medicine. Soy consumption correlates negatively 
with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and voiding symptoms. However, 
isoflavone effects on the prostate are hardly known. Here, we examined the 
effects on human prostate smooth muscle contractions and stromal cell growth, 
which are driving factors of voiding symptoms in BPH. Smooth muscle contractions 
were induced in prostate tissues from radical prostatectomy. Growth-related 
functions were studied in cultured stromal cells (WPMY-1). Neurogenic, 
α1-adrenergic and non-adrenergic contractions were strongly inhibited with 50 µM 
and by around 50% with 10 µM genistein. Daidzein inhibited neurogenic 
contractions using 10 and 100 µM. Agonist-induced contractions were inhibited by 
100 µM but not 10 µM daidzein. A combination of 6 µM genistein with 5 µM 
daidzein still inhibited neurogenic and agonist-induced contractions. 
Proliferation of WPMY-1 cells was inhibited by genistein (>50%) and daidzein 
(<50%). Genistein induced apoptosis and cell death (by seven-fold relative to 
controls), while daidzein induced cell death (6.4-fold) without apoptosis. 
Viability was reduced by genistein (maximum: 87%) and daidzein (62%). In 
conclusion, soy isoflavones exert sustained effects on prostate smooth muscle 
contractions and stromal cell growth, which may explain the inverse 
relationships between soy-rich nutrition, BPH and voiding symptoms.

In vitro and in vivo evaluation of a novel lidocaine-loaded cubosomal gel for 
prolonged local anesthesia.

Jiang J(1), Wu H(1), Zou Z(1).

Marketed lidocaine dosage forms (such as ointment, gels, and injections) used to 
manage acute and chronic pain showed a short duration of action (<2 h). In this 
study, a lidocaine-loaded cubosomal gel was prepared to sustain the release of 
lidocaine to prolong the local anesthetic effect (high drug retention in the 
skin). Lidocaine-loaded cubosomal gels were prepared by melt emulsification and 
sonication using Pluronic F127 and DL-α-monoolein (at different levels). The 
cubosomal gels were characterized by morphology, size, zeta potential, 
entrapment efficacy, assay, viscosity, pH, and texture profiles. Ex vivo 
lidocaine permeation and retention studies were performed using Sprague-Dawley 
rat skin. Transmission electron microscopy images confirmed the bi-continuous 
liquid crystalline phase with a honeycomb cubosome structure. The cubosomal 
particle size (103-227 nm), viscosity (13,524-15,627cp), and entrapment efficacy 
(78.4-94.7%) increase with the level of monoolein. The ex-vivo permeation study 
showed a biphasic release pattern, with lidocaine cleared from ointment within 
4 h (97.9% cumulative release), while cubosomal gels showed sustained release up 
to 24 h (53.33-98.86% cumulative release). A skin retention study demonstrated 
that cubosomes can increase (up to 28-fold) the lidocaine content in the skin 
(4.56 mg) compared to ointment (0.19 mg). A rabbit skin irritation study showed 
no sign of irritation after the application of cubosomal gel. In the radiant 
heat tail-flick study, the local anesthetic effect of lidocaine from the 
cubosomal gel was sustained for up to 16 h with 1.43-fold higher efficacy than 
marketed ointment. In conclusion, the study demonstrated the potential of 
cubosomal nanoparticle-laden gel to sustain the release of lidocaine for 
prolonging local anesthetic effects for pain management.

Arabidopsis stromal carbonic anhydrases exhibit non-overlapping roles in 
photosynthetic efficiency and development.

Sharma N(1), Froehlich JE(1)(2), Rillema R(1), Raba DA(1), Chambers T(1), 
Kerfeld CA(1)(2), Kramer DM(1)(2), Walker B(1)(3), Brandizzi F(1)(3)(4).

Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are ubiquitous enzymes that accelerate the reversible 
conversion of CO2 to HCO3 - . The Arabidopsis genome encodes members of the α-, 
β- and γ-CA families, and it has been hypothesized that βCA activity has a role 
in photosynthesis. In this work, we tested this hypothesis by characterizing the 
two plastidial βCAs, βCA1 and βCA5, in physiological conditions of growth. We 
conclusively established that both proteins are localized in the chloroplast 
stroma and that the loss of βCA5 induced the expression of βCA1, supporting the 
existence of regulatory mechanisms to control the expression of stromal βCAs. We 
also established that βCA1 and βCA5 have markedly different enzymatic kinetics 
and physiological relevance. Specifically, we found that βCA5 had a first-order 
rate constant ~10-fold lower than βCA1, and that the loss of βCA5 is detrimental 
to growth and could be rescued by high CO2 . Furthermore, we established that, 
while a βCA1 mutation showed near wild-type growth and no significant impact on 
photosynthetic efficiency, the loss of βCA5 markedly disrupted photosynthetic 
efficiency and light-harvesting capacity at ambient CO2 . Therefore, we conclude 
that in physiological autotrophic growth, the loss of the more highly expressed 
βCA1 does not compensate for the loss of a less active βCA5, which in turn is 
involved in growth and photosynthesis at ambient CO2 levels. These results lend 
support to the hypothesis that, in Arabidopsis,βCAs have non-overlapping roles 
in photosynthesis and identify a critical activity of stromal βCA5 and a 
dispensable role for βCA1.

Inhibition of adenylyl cyclase 1 by ST034307 inhibits IP(3)-evoked changes in 
sino-atrial node beat rate.

Bose SJ(1), Read MJ(1), Akerman E(1), Capel RA(1), Ayagama T(1), Russell 
A(1)(2), Terrar DA(1), Zaccolo M(3), Burton RAB(1).

Atrial arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation (AF), are a major mortality risk 
and a leading cause of stroke. The IP3 signalling pathway has been proposed as 
an atrial-specific target for AF therapy, and atrial IP3 signalling has been 
linked to the activation of calcium sensitive adenylyl cyclases AC1 and AC8. We 
investigated the involvement of AC1 in the response of intact mouse atrial 
tissue and isolated guinea pig atrial and sino-atrial node (SAN) cells to the 
α-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine (PE) using the selective AC1 inhibitor 
ST034307. The maximum rate change of spontaneously beating mouse right atrial 
tissue exposed to PE was reduced from 14.5% to 8.2% (p = 0.005) in the presence 
of 1 μM ST034307, whereas the increase in tension generated in paced left atrial 
tissue in the presence of PE was not inhibited by ST034307 (Control = 14.2%, 
ST034307 = 16.3%; p > 0.05). Experiments were performed using isolated guinea 
pig atrial and SAN cells loaded with Fluo-5F-AM to record changes in calcium 
transients (CaT) generated by 10 μM PE in the presence and absence of 1 μM 
ST034307. ST034307 significantly reduced the beating rate of SAN cells 
(0.34-fold decrease; p = 0.003) but did not inhibit changes in CaT amplitude in 
response to PE in atrial cells. The results presented here demonstrate 
pharmacologically the involvement of AC1 in the downstream response of atrial 
pacemaker activity to α-adrenoreceptor stimulation and IP3R calcium release.

Carbohydrate Repartitioning in the Rice Starch Branching Enzyme IIb Mutant 
Stimulates Higher Resistant Starch Content and Lower Seed Weight Revealed by 
Multiomics Analysis.

Chen Y(1), Luo L(1), Xu F(2), Xu X(3), Bao J(2)(3)(4).

The starch branching enzyme IIb mutant (be2b) in rice significantly increases 
the resistant starch (RS) content and leads to reduced seed weight. However, the 
underlying metabolic mechanisms remain unclear. Proteomic analysis indicated 
that upregulation of starch synthase IIa (SSIIa) and SSIIIa and downregulation 
of BEI and SSI were possibly responsible for the decreased short amylopectin 
chains (DP 6-15) and increased longer chains (DP > 16) of be2b starch. The 
upregulation of granule-bound starch synthase led to increased amylose content 
(AC). These changes in the amylopectin structure and AC accounted for the 
increased RS content. α-Amylase 2A showed the strongest upregulation (up to 
8.45-fold), indicating that the loss of BEIIb activity enhanced starch 
degradation. Upregulation of glycolysis-related proteins stimulated carbohydrate 
repartitioning through glycerate-3-phosphate and promoted the accumulation of 
tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, amino acids, and fatty acids. The 
unexpected carbohydrate partitioning and enhanced starch degradation resulted in 
the reduced seed weight in the be2b mutant.

Enzymatic Synthesis of Novel and Highly Soluble Puerarin Glucoside by 
Deinococcus geothermalis Amylosucrase.

Ding HY(1), Wang TY(2), Wu JY(3), Tsai YL(4), Chang TS(4).

Puerarin (daidzein-8-C-glucoside) is an isoflavone isolated from several 
leguminous plants of the genus Pueraria. Puerarin possesses several 
pharmacological properties; however, the poor solubility of puerarin limits its 
applications. To resolve this poor solubility, Deinococcus geothermalis 
amylosucrase (DgAS) was used to modify puerarin into more soluble derivatives. 
The results showed that DgAS could biotransform puerarin into a novel compound: 
puerarin-4'-O-α-glucoside. The biotransformation reaction was manipulated at 
different temperatures, pH values, sucrose concentrations, reaction times, and 
enzyme concentrations. The results showed that the optimal reaction condition 
was biotransformed by 200 μg/mL DgAS with 20% (w/v) sucrose at pH 6 and 
incubated at 40 °C for 48 h, and the optimal production yield was 35.1%. 
Puerarin-4'-O-α-glucoside showed 129-fold higher solubility than that of 
puerarin and, thus, could be further applied for pharmacological use in the 
future.

A Sulfur-Bridging Sulfonate-Modified Zinc(II) Phthalocyanine Nanoliposome 
Possessing Hybrid Type I and Type II Photoreactions with Efficient Photodynamic 
Anticancer Effects.

Chen Z(1), Zhao YY(1), Li L(1), Li Z(1), Fu S(1), Xu Y(1), Zheng BY(1), Ke M(1), 
Li X(1), Huang JD(1).

Phthalocyanines are potentially promising photosensitizers (PSs) for 
photodynamic therapy (PDT), but the inherent defects such as aggregation-caused 
quenching effects and non-specific toxicity severely hinder their further 
application in PDT. Herein, we synthesized two zinc(II) phthalocyanines (PcSA 
and PcOA) monosubstituted with a sulphonate group in the alpha position with "O 
bridge" and "S bridge" as bonds and prepared a liposomal nanophotosensitizer 
(PcSA@Lip) by thin-film hydration method to regulate the aggregation of PcSA in 
the aqueous solution and enhance its tumor targeting ability. PcSA@Lip exhibited 
highly efficient production of superoxide radical (O2∙-) and singlet oxygen 
(1O2) in water under light irradiation, which were 2.6-fold and 15.4-fold higher 
than those of free PcSA, respectively. Furthermore, PcSA@Lip was able to 
accumulate selectively in tumors after intravenous injection with the 
fluorescence intensity ratio of tumors to livers was 4.1:1. The significant 
tumor inhibition effects resulted in a 98% tumor inhibition rate after PcSA@Lip 
was injected intravenously at an ultra-low PcSA@Lip dose (0.8 nmol g-1 PcSA) and 
light dose (30 J cm-2). Therefore, the liposomal PcSA@Lip is a prospective 
nanophotosensitizer possessing hybrid type I and type II photoreactions with 
efficient photodynamic anticancer effects.

Mechanism of autophagy induced by low concentrations of chlorantraniliprole in 
silk gland, Bombyx mori.

Mao T(1), Ye W(1), Dai M(1), Bian D(1), Zhu Q(1), Feng P(1), Ren Y(1), Li F(2), 
Li B(3).

Chlorantraniliprole (CAP) is widely used in the control of agricultural pests, 
and its residues can affect the formation of silkworm (Bombyx. mori) cocoon 
easily. To accurately evaluate the toxicity of CAP to silkworms and clarify the 
mechanism of its effect on silk gland function, we proposed a novel toxicity 
evaluation method based on the body weight changes after CAP exposure. We also 
analyzed the Ca2+-related ATPase activity, characterized energy metabolism and 
transcriptional changes about the autophagy key genes on the downstream 
signaling pathways. The results showed that after a low concentration of CAP 
exposed for 96 h, there were CAP residues in the silk glands of B. mori, the 
activities of Ca2+-ATPase and Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPase decreased significantly 
(P ≤ 0.01), and the activation of AMPK-related genes AMPK-α and AMPK-β were 
up-regulated by 6.39 ± 0.02-fold and 12.33 ± 1.06-fold, respectively, reaching a 
significant level (P ≤ 0.01)). In addition, the autophagy-related genes Atg1, 
Atg6, Atg5, Atg7, and Atg8 downstream AMPK were significantly up-regulated at 
96 h (P ≤ 0.05). The results of immunohistochemistry and protein expression 
assay for autophagy marker Atg8 further confirmed the occurrence of autophagy. 
Overall, our results indicate that CAP exposure leads to autophagy in the silk 
gland of B. mori and affects their physiological functions, which provides 
guidance for the evaluation of toxicity of low concentration environmental CAP 
residues to insects.

Transgenic overexpression of microRNA-30d in pancreatic beta-cells progressively 
regulates beta-cell function and identity.

Mao Y(1), Schoenborn J(1), Wang Z(1), Chen X(1), Matson K(1), Mohan R(1), Zhang 
S(1), Tang X(1), Arunagiri A(2), Arvan P(2), Tang X(3).

Abnormal microRNA functions are closely associated with pancreatic β-cell loss 
and dysfunction in type 2 diabetes. Dysregulation of miR-30d has been reported 
in the individuals with diabetes. To study how miR-30d affects pancreatic β-cell 
functions, we generated two transgenic mouse lines that specifically 
overexpressed miR-30d in β-cells at distinct low and high levels. Transgenic 
overexpressed miR-30d systemically affected β-cell function. Elevated miR-30d at 
low-level (TgL, 2-fold) had mild effects on signaling pathways and displayed no 
significant changes to metabolic homeostasis. In contrast, transgenic mice with 
high-level of miR-30d expression (TgH, 12-fold) exhibited significant 
diet-induced hyperglycemia and β-cell dysfunction. In addition, loss of β-cell 
identity was invariably accompanied with increased insulin/glucagon-double 
positive bihormonal cells and excess plasma glucagon levels. The transcriptomic 
analysis revealed that miR-30d overexpression inhibited β-cell-enriched gene 
expression and induced α-cell-enriched gene expression. These findings implicate 
that an appropriate miR-30d level is essential in maintaining normal β-cell 
identity and function.

Extraction of essential oils from tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia) and lemon 
grass (Cymbopogon citratus) using betaine-based deep eutectic solvent (DES).

Mori N(1), Usuki T(1).

INTRODUCTION: The essential oils of tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia) leaves 
mainly contain eucalyptol, α-terpinene, γ -terpinene, and terpinen-4-ol and have 
anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-infective, and anti-inflammatory actions. The 
essential oils of lemon grass (Cymbopogon citratus) leaves mainly contain neral, 
geranial, and geraniol and have anti-microbial and anti-fungal activities and 
hypocholesterolemic effect.
OBJECTIVES: The present study describes the use of low-toxicity solvents called 
betaine-based deep eutectic solvents (DESs) for efficient extraction of 
essential oils from tea tree and lemon grass. H2 O and EtOH were used for 
extraction as control methods.
METHODOLOGY: Quantitative analysis was performed using gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometry (GC-MS) in selected ion monitoring mode. Scanning electron 
micrography (SEM) and antioxidant assays for extracted samples were also 
conducted.
RESULTS: The results indicated that extraction for tea tree using 
betaine/sucrose (molar ratio 2:1) improved the yields of terpinolene and 
eucalyptol 2.5- and 1.9-fold, respectively, compared with the control method. In 
lemon grass, extraction using betaine/sucrose (molar ratio 2:1) improved the 
yields of neral and geranial 1.9- and 1.7-fold, respectively, compared with the 
control method.
CONCLUSION: These results demonstrated the effective extraction of essential 
oils from plant leaves under milder conditions than those needed for the 
conventional methods. The environmentally benign DESs for the extraction would 
be applicable to the food and cosmetic industries.

Development of an Efficient Extraction Methodology to Analyse Potential 
Inflammatory Biomarkers from Sebum.

Jayabal H(1), Bader DL(1), Worsley P(1).

INTRODUCTION: Proteins, such as cytokines and chemokines, are present in varying 
concentrations in a range of biofluids, with an important signalling role in 
maintaining homeostasis. Commercial tapes have been employed to non-invasively 
collect these potential biomarkers in sebum from the skin surface to examine 
their concentrations in conditions including acne, atopic dermatitis, and 
pressure ulcers. However, the identification of robust biomarker candidates is 
limited by the low abundance of specific proteins extracted by current 
methodologies. Therefore, this study was designed to develop an optimized 
extraction method for potential inflammatory biomarkers in sebum collected with 
Sebutapes.
METHODS: Commercial tapes (Sebutapes) coated with synthetic sebum were used to 
systematically evaluate the effects of chemical and mechanical stimuli on 
extraction efficiency. Varying concentrations of high- and low-abundance 
biomarkers (IL-1α, IL-6, IL-8, INF-γ, TNF-α, and IL-1RA) were used to spike the 
synthetic sebum samples. Methodological variables included different 
surfactants, mechanical stimuli, and buffer volume. Extraction efficiency was 
estimated using immunoassay kits from the extracted buffer.
RESULTS: The results revealed that the use of a surfactant, i.e., β-dodecyl 
maltoside, in addition to the mechanical stimuli, namely, sonication and 
centrifugation, resulted in an increased recovery of cytokines, ranging from 80% 
for high-abundant cytokines, such as IL-1α and IL-1RA, and up to 50% for 
low-abundance cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8. Compared to previous 
methods, the new extraction protocol resulted in between a 1.5-2.0-fold increase 
in extraction efficiency.
CONCLUSION: The study revealed that there was a high degree of variability in 
the extraction efficiency of different cytokines. However, improved efficiency 
was achieved across all cytokines with selective surfactants and mechanical 
stimuli. The optimised protocol will provide means to detect low levels of 
potential biomarkers from skin surface, enabling the evaluation of local changes 
in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines present in different skin conditions.

Geranium wallichianum D. Don Ex Sweet Ameliorates Rheumatoid Arthritis by 
Curtailing the Expression of COX-II and Inflammatory Cytokines as Well as by 
Alleviating the Oxidative Stress.

Jabeen Q(1), Haider SI(1)(2), Asif A(3), Rasheed R(3), Gul S(1), Arshad S(4).

Geranium wallichianum D. Don ex sweet traditionally been used as home remedy for 
backaches, joint pain, colic, and rheumatism. The objective of this study was to 
investigate the therapeutic benefits of plant in an adjuvant-induced arthritis 
paradigm. Immune-mediated rheumatoid arthritis was developed by injecting 
complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) into the hind paws of rats and the aqueous 
methanolic crude extract was administered. The animals were physically monitored 
for changes in paw edema size and arthritic score. Hematological parameters and 
systemic inflammatory indicators evaluated. Genetic expressions of tumor 
necrosis factor (TNF-α), interleukins (IL-1β, IL-6), necrosis factor (NF-κB), 
and cyclooxygenase (COX-II) enzyme were studied using real-time qPCR. PGE2 
levels in blood were quantified through Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay 
(ELISA). On the 14th day, Immunoglobulin E (IGE) exhibited a substantial decline 
in paw edema and arthritic score. At the doses of 500 mg/Kg (P ≤ .05) and 
1000 mg/Kg (P ≤ .001), IGE significantly reduced TNF-α, interleukins, and COX-II 
mRNA expression. IGE significantly lowered the MDA levels at the doses of 500 
and 1000 mg/Kg (13.18 ± .70 and 9.04 ± .26 μM/L respectively) as compared to 
arthritic control (30.82 ± 1.12 μM/L) group. IGE significantly improved the 
antioxidant enzyme activities of CAT and SOD (P ≤ .001) in treated animals. 
TNF-α, interleukins, and COX-II mRNA expression were also significantly reduced 
at the doses of 300 (P ≤ .05), 500 (P ≤ .01) and 1000 mg/Kg (P ≤ .001) which 
were expressed as fold changes. This study shows that Geranium wallichianum D. 
Don ex sweet has a strong potential to alleviate immune-mediated arthritis by 
lowering oxidative stress and downregulating the proinflammatory cytokines 
signaling mechanisms.

Screening potential hypertensive peptides using two consecutive bioassay-guided 
SPE fractionations and identification of an ACE inhibitory peptide, DHSTAVW 
(DW7), derived from pearl garlic protein hydrolysate.

Yudho Sutopo CC(1), Aznam N(2), Arianingrum R(2), Hsu JL(3).

The pearl garlic (Allium sativum L.) protein (PGP) was digested using pepsin, 
trypsin, α-chymotrypsin, thermolysin, and simulated gastrointestinal digestion. 
The α-chymotrypsin hydrolysate showed the highest angiotensin-I-converting 
enzyme inhibitory (ACEI) activity, with an IC50 value of 190.9 ± 11 µg/mL. A 
reversed-phase C18 solid-phase extraction (RP-SPE) cartridge was used for the 
first fractionation, and the S4 fraction from RP-SPE showed the most potent ACEI 
activity (IC50 =124.1 ± 11 3 µg/mL). The S4 fraction was further fractionated 
using a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography SPE (HILIC-SPE). The H4 
fraction from HILIC-SPE showed the highest ACEI activity (IC50 =57.7 ± 3 µg/mL). 
Four ACEI peptides (DHSTAVW, KLAKVF, KLSTAASF, and KETPEAHVF) were identified 
from the H4 fraction using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry 
(LC-MS/MS), and their biological activities were appraised in silico. Among the 
identified α-chymotryptic peptides, DHSTAVW (DW7), derived from I lectin partial 
protein, exhibited the most potent ACEI activity (IC50 value of 2.8 ± 0.1 µM). 
DW7 was resistant to simulated gastrointestinal digestion, and it was classified 
as a prodrug-type inhibitor according to the preincubation experiment. The 
inhibition kinetics indicated that DW7 was a competitive inhibitor, which was 
rationalized by the molecular docking simulation. The quantities of DW7 in 1 mg 
of hydrolysate, S4 fraction, and H4 fraction were quantified using LC-MS/MS to 
give 3.1 ± 0.1, 4.2 ± 0.1, and 13.2 ± 0.1 µg, respectively. The amount of DW7 
was significantly increased by 4.2-fold compared with the hydrolysate, which 
suggested that this method is efficient for active peptide screening.

The neutralising and stimulatory effects of antimicrobial peptide LL-37 in human 
gingival fibroblasts.

Lappin MJ(1), Dellett M(2), Mills KI(2), Lundy FT(3), Irwin CR(4).

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of LL-37, a broad spectrum antimicrobial 
peptide expressed in periodontal tissues, on human gingival fibroblast 
responsiveness to microbial challenge and to explore the direct effects of LL-37 
on human gingival fibroblasts.
DESIGN: The effect of LL-37 on bacterial lipopolysaccharide-induced expression 
of Interleukin (IL-6) and chemokine C-X-C motif ligand (CXCL) 8 was determined 
by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). LL-37's influence on bacterial 
lipopolysaccharide-induced IκBα degradation was investigated by western blot. 
DNA microarray analysis initially determined the direct effects of LL-37 on gene 
expression, these findings were subsequently confirmed by quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction and ELISA analysis of selected genes.
RESULTS: Bacterial lipopolysaccharide-induced IL-6 and CXCL8 production by human 
gingival fibroblasts was significantly reduced in the presence of LL-37 at 
concentrations in the range of 1-10 µg/ml. LL-37 led to a reduction in 
lipopolysaccharide-induced IκBα degradation by Escherichia coli 
lipopolysaccharide and Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (10 µg/ml). 
LL-37 (50 µg/ml) significantly altered the gene expression of 367 genes in human 
gingival fibroblasts by at least 2-fold. CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, Interleukin-24 
(IL-24), CXCL8, Chemokine (C-C motif) Ligand 2, and Suppressor of Cytokine 
Signalling 3 mRNA were significantly upregulated by LL-37. LL-37 also 
significantly stimulated expression of CXCL8, hepatocyte growth factor and CXCL1 
at the protein level.
CONCLUSION: LL-37 plays an important regulatory role in the immunomodulatory 
activity of gingival fibroblasts by inhibiting lipopolysaccharide -induced 
expression of inflammatory cytokines and directly stimulating the expression of 
an array of bioactive molecules involved in inflammation and repair.

Rubisco forms a lattice inside alpha-carboxysomes.

Metskas LA(1)(2)(3), Ortega D(4), Oltrogge LM(5), Blikstad C(5)(6), Lovejoy 
DR(7), Laughlin TG(5)(8), Savage DF(5), Jensen GJ(9)(10).

Despite the importance of microcompartments in prokaryotic biology and 
bioengineering, structural heterogeneity has prevented a complete understanding 
of their architecture, ultrastructure, and spatial organization. Here, we employ 
cryo-electron tomography to image α-carboxysomes, a pseudo-icosahedral 
microcompartment responsible for carbon fixation. We have solved a 
high-resolution subtomogram average of the Rubisco cargo inside the carboxysome, 
and determined the arrangement of the enzyme. We find that the H. neapolitanus 
Rubisco polymerizes in vivo, mediated by the small Rubisco subunit. These 
fibrils can further pack to form a lattice with six-fold pseudo-symmetry. This 
arrangement preserves freedom of motion and accessibility around the Rubisco 
active site and the binding sites for two other carboxysome proteins, CsoSCA (a 
carbonic anhydrase) and the disordered CsoS2, even at Rubisco concentrations 
exceeding 800 μM. This characterization of Rubisco cargo inside the 
α-carboxysome provides insight into the balance between order and disorder in 
microcompartment organization.

Chronic administration of catalase inhibitor attenuates hypertension in 
renovascular hypertensive rats.

Lauar MR(1), Colombari DSA(1), De Paula PM(1), Colombari E(1), Andrade CAF(1), 
De Luca LA Jr(1), Menani JV(2).

AIMS: Reactive oxygen species like hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) are produced 
endogenously and may participate in intra- and extracellular signaling, 
including modulation of angiotensin II responses. In the present study, we 
investigated the effects of chronic subcutaneous (sc) administration of the 
catalase inhibitor 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (ATZ) on arterial pressure, autonomic 
modulation of arterial pressure, hypothalamic expression of AT1 receptors and 
neuroinflammatory markers and fluid balance in 2-kidney, 1clip (2K1C) 
renovascular hypertensive rats.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Holtzman rats with a clip occluding partially the 
left renal artery and chronic sc injections of ATZ were used.
KEY FINDINGS: Subcutaneous injections of ATZ (600 mg/kg of body weight/day) for 
9 days in 2K1C rats reduced arterial pressure (137 ± 8, vs. saline: 
182 ± 8 mmHg). ATZ also reduced the sympathetic modulation and enhanced the 
parasympathetic modulation of pulse interval, reducing the sympatho-vagal 
balance. Additionally, ATZ reduced mRNA expression for interleukins 6 and IL-1β, 
tumor necrosis factor-α, AT1 receptor (0.77 ± 0.06, vs. saline: 1.47 ± 0.26 fold 
change), NOX 2 (0.85 ± 0.13, vs. saline: 1.75 ± 0.15 fold change) and the marker 
of microglial activation, CD 11 (0.47 ± 0.07, vs. saline, 1.34 ± 0.15 fold 
change) in the hypothalamus of 2K1C rats. Daily water and food intake and renal 
excretion were only slightly modified by ATZ.
SIGNIFICANCE: The results suggest that the increase of endogenous H2O2 
availability with chronic treatment with ATZ had an anti-hypertensive effect in 
2K1C hypertensive rats. This effect depends on decreased activity of sympathetic 
pressor mechanisms and mRNA expression of AT1 receptors and neuroinflammatory 
markers possibly due to reduced angiotensin II action.

Soil filtration-sedimentation improves shelled protist recovery in eukaryotic 
eDNA surveys.

J(5)(6), Peñas J(5), Huang S(4), Strasberg D(2), Vittoz P(7), Mitchell EAD(1).

A large part of the soil protist diversity is missed in metabarcoding studies 
based on 0.25 g of soil environmental DNA (eDNA) and universal primers due to 
ca. 80% co-amplification of non-target plants, animals and fungi. To overcome 
this problem, enrichment of the substrate used for eDNA extraction is an easily 
implemented option but its effect has not yet been tested. In this study, we 
evaluated the effect of a 150 μm mesh size filtration and sedimentation method 
to improve the recovery of protist eDNA, while reducing the co-extraction of 
plant, animal and fungal eDNA, using a set of contrasted forest and alpine soils 
from La Réunion, Japan, Spain and Switzerland. Total eukaryotic diversity was 
estimated by V4 18S rRNA metabarcoding and classical amplicon sequence variant 
calling. A 2- to 3-fold enrichment in shelled protists (Euglyphida, Arcellinida 
and Chrysophyceae) was observed at the sample level with the proposed method, 
with, at the same time, a 2-fold depletion of Fungi and a 3-fold depletion of 
Embryophyceae. Protist alpha diversity was slightly lower in filtered samples 
due to reduced coverage in Variosea and Sarcomonadea, but significant 
differences were observed in only one region. Beta diversity varied mostly 
between regions and habitats, which explained the same proportion of variance in 
bulk soil and filtered samples. The increased resolution in soil protist 
diversity estimates provided by the filtration-sedimentation method is a strong 
argument in favour of including it in the standard protocol for soil protist 
eDNA metabarcoding studies.

Increasing Linker Chain Length and Intestinal Stability Enhances Lymphatic 
Transport and Lymph Node Exposure of Triglyceride Mimetic Prodrugs of a Model 
Immunomodulator Mycophenolic Acid.

Simpson JS(1), Trevaskis NL, Porter CJH.

Targeted delivery of immunomodulators to the lymphatic system has the potential 
to enhance therapeutic efficacy by increasing colocalization of drugs with 
immune targets such as lymphocytes. A triglyceride (TG)-mimetic prodrug strategy 
has been recently shown to enhance the lymphatic delivery of a model 
immunomodulator, mycophenolic acid (MPA), via incorporation into the intestinal 
TG deacylation-reacylation and lymph lipoprotein transport pathways. In the 
current study, a series of structurally related TG prodrugs of MPA were examined 
to optimize structure-lymphatic transport relationships for lymph-directing 
lipid-mimetic prodrugs. MPA was conjugated to the sn-2 position of the glyceride 
backbone of the prodrugs using linkers of different chain length (5-21 carbons) 
and the effect of methyl substitutions at the alpha and/or beta carbons to the 
glyceride end of the linker was examined. Lymphatic transport was assessed in 
mesenteric lymph duct cannulated rats, and drug exposure in lymph nodes was 
examined following oral administration to mice. Prodrug stability in simulated 
intestinal digestive fluid was also evaluated. Prodrugs with straight chain 
linkers were relatively unstable in simulated intestinal fluid; however, 
co-administration of lipase inhibitors (JZL184 and orlistat) was able to reduce 
instability and increase lymphatic transport (2-fold for a prodrug with a 
6-carbon spacer, i.e., MPA-C6-TG). Methyl substitutions to the chain resulted in 
similar trends in improving intestinal stability and lymphatic transport. 
Medium- to long-chain spacers (C12, C15) between MPA and the glyceride backbone 
were most effective in promoting lymphatic transport, consistent with increases 
in lipophilicity. In contrast, short-chain (C6-C10) linkers appeared to be too 
unstable in the intestine and insufficiently lipophilic to associate with lymph 
lipid transport pathways, while very long-chain (C18, C21) linkers were also not 
preferred, likely as a result of increases in molecular weight reducing 
solubility or permeability. In addition to more effectively promoting drug 
transport into mesenteric lymph, TG-mimetic prodrugs based on a C12 linker 
resulted in marked increases (>40 fold) in the exposure of MPA in the mesenteric 
lymph nodes in mice when compared to administration of MPA alone, suggesting 
that optimizing prodrug design has the potential to provide benefit in targeting 
and modulating immune cells.

Effect of an Oral Bivalent Vaccine on Immune Response and Immune Gene Profiling 
in Vaccinated Red Tilapia (Oreochromis spp.) during Infections with 
Streptococcus iniae and Aeromonas hydrophila.

Azzam-Sayuti M(4), Ina-Salwany MY(1)(4).

Streptococcosis and aeromonasis inflicted by Streptococcus iniae and Aeromonas 
hydrophila, respectively, have affected tilapia industries worldwide. In this 
study, we investigated antibody responses and explored the mechanisms of 
protection rendered by an oral bivalent vaccine in red tilapia following 
challenges with S. iniae and A. hydrophila. The results of specific IgM antibody 
response revealed that the IgM titers against S. iniae and A. hydrophila in the 
bivalent incorporated (BI) vaccine group were significantly higher (p < 0.05) 
than those in the bivalent spray (BS) vaccine fish and unvaccinated control fish 
throughout the experiment. Real-time qPCR results also showed that the gene 
expression of CD4, MHC-I, MHC-II, IgT, C-type lysozyme, IL-1β, TNF-α, and TGF-β 
remained significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that of the controls between 24 
and 72 h post-infection (hpi) in both mucosal (hindgut) and systemic (spleen and 
head−kidney) organs of BI vaccinated fish. Furthermore, the highest relative 
expression of the TGF-β, C-type lysozyme, and IgT genes in the BI vaccinated 
group was observed in the challenged fish’s spleen (8.8-fold), head kidney 
(4.4-fold), and hindgut (19.7-fold) tissues, respectively. The present study 
suggests that the bivalent incorporated (BI) vaccine could effectively improve 
the immune function and activate both humoral and cell-mediated immunities in 
vaccinated red tilapia following the bacterial challenges.

The lactate receptor GPR81 is predominantly expressed in type II human skeletal 
muscle fibers: potential for lactate autocrine signaling.

Nordström F(1), Liegnell R(1), Apró W(1)(2), Blackwood SJ(1), Katz A(1), Moberg 
M(1)(3).

Gi-coupled protein receptor 81 (GPR81) was first identified in adipocytes as a 
receptor for l-lactate, which upon binding inhibits cyclicAMP (cAMP)-protein 
kinase (PKA)-cAMP-response element binding (CREB) signaling. Moreover, 
incubation of myotubes with lactate augments expression of GPR81 and genes and 
proteins involved in lactate- and energy metabolism. However, characterization 
of GPR81 expression and investigation of related signaling in human skeletal 
muscle under conditions of elevated circulating lactate levels are lacking. 
Muscle biopsies were obtained from healthy men and women at rest, after leg 
extension exercise, with or without venous infusion of sodium lactate, and 90 
and 180 min after exercise (8 men and 8 women). Analyses included protein and 
mRNA levels of GPR81, as well as GPR81-dependent signaling molecules. GPR81 
expression was 2.5-fold higher in type II glycolytic compared with type I 
oxidative muscle fibers, and the expression was inversely related to the 
percentage of type I muscle fibers. Muscle from women expressed about 25% more 
GPR81 protein than from men. Global PKA activity increased by 5%-8% after 
exercise, with no differences between trials. CREBS133 phosphorylation was 
reduced by 30% after exercise and remained repressed during the entire trials, 
with no influence of the lactate infusion. The mRNA expression of vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor 
gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α) were increased by 2.5-6-fold during recovery, 
and that of lactate dehydrogenase reduced by 15% with no differences between 
trials for any gene at any time point. The high expression of GPR81-protein in 
type II fibers suggests that lactate functions as an autocrine signaling 
molecule in muscle; however, lactate does not appear to regulate CREB signaling 
during exercise.

Biochemical characterization and peptide mass fingerprinting of two glutathione 
transferases from Biomphalaria alexandrina snails (Gastropoda: Planorbidae).

Abdalla AM(1), Abdel Karim GSA(2).

BACKGROUND: The freshwater snails Biomphalaria alexandrina (Gastropoda: 
Planorbidae) has public health importance of being an intermediate host of 
Schistosoma mansoni, the parasite species that causes intestinal schistosomiasis 
in humans. Glutathione transferases (GSTs) play an important role in 
detoxification of a broad range of compounds including secondary metabolites and 
exogenous compounds. Studying GSTs in snails may clarify their role in 
detoxification of molluscicides.
RESULTS: Two glutathione transferases (BaGST2 and BaGST3) were purified and 
characterized from B. alexandrina snails. BaGST2 and BaGST3 were 
electrophoretically homogeneous preparations with subunit molecular weight of 
23.6 kDa and molecular weight of 45 kDa. Isoelectric focusing of BaGST2 revealed 
the presence of two components at pI 4.47 and 4.67, while BaGST3 showed one band 
at pI 4.17. The specific activity of BaGST2 and BaGST3 toward 
1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) was 19.0 and 45.2 μmol/min/mg protein 
following 146- and 346-fold purification, respectively. The catalytic pH optima, 
km values, and the activation energies for BaGST2 and BaGST3 were determined. 
BaGST2 and BaGST3 were significantly inhibited by hematin and Cibacron Blue and 
to a less extent by bromosulfophthalein, S-butyl-GSH, S-hexyl-GSH, and 
S-P-bromobenzyl-GSH. BaGST2 and BaGST3 showed high activity against ethacrynic 
acid as substrate, and they also exhibited peroxidase activity on cumene 
hydroperoxide. The two enzymes showed identical patterns of lysine-C digestion 
after high-performance liquid chromatography. The amino acid sequences of three 
peptide fragments and peptide mass fingerprinting of fourteen peptides were used 
to predict the primary structure of BaGST2. A polypeptide of 206 amino acids 
(with 7 gaps, 3 of which could not identified) was predicted for BaGST2. The 
theoretical subunit molecular weight of BaGST2 is 22.6 kDa, with pI of 8.58. 
BaGST2 has 65% sequence identity and 78% positive with Biomphalaria glabrata 
GST7. The overall structure of BaGST2 at the N-terminal domain is identical to 
the canonical GST N-terminal domain, having the typical thioredoxin-like fold 
with a βαβ-α-ββα motif, whereas the C-terminal domain is made from 6 α-helices. 
A conservative GST-N-domain includes glutathione binding sites Y11, L17, Q53, 
M54, Q65, and S66, while a variable GST-C domain contains electrophilic 
substrate binding site H99, R102, A103, F106, K107, L161, and Y167. Phylogenetic 
tree showed that BaGST2 was clustered in the sigma group with GSTs sigma class 
from invertebrates and vertebrates.
CONCLUSIONS: We have purified and characterized two GSTs from B. alexandrina 
snails. Our study broadens the biochemical information on freshwater snail GSTs 
by demonstrating the role of BaGSTs in defense mechanisms against structurally 
different electrophilic compounds. BaGST2 and BaGST3 have Se-independent 
peroxidase activity, which indicates their role in cellular antioxidant defense 
by reducing organic hydroperoxides in B. alexandrina. A polypeptide chain of 206 
amino acids was predicted. The primary structure of BaGST2 showed 65% sequence 
identity with Biomphalaria glabrata GST7. Sequence analysis indicates that 
BaGST2 is a GST-N-sigma-like with a thioredoxin-like superfamily. Phylogenetic 
tree confirms that BaGST2 belongs to the sigma class of GSTs superfamily.

facultative endosymbiont Sinorhizobium (Ensifer) meliloti, we identified a 
previously uncharacterized gene required for growth on solid media with 
increased NaCl concentrations. The encoded protein carries a predicted 
thioredoxin fold and deletion of the gene also results in increased sensitivity 
to hydrogen peroxide and cumene hydroperoxide. We have designated the gene srlA 
(stress resistance locus A) based on these phenotypes. A deletion mutant yields 
phenotypic revertants on high salt medium and genome sequencing revealed that 
all revertants carry a mutation in genes homologous to either cenK or cenR. srlA 
promoter activity is abolished in these revertant host backgrounds and in a 
strain carrying a deletion in cenK. We also observed that the srlA promoter is 
autoregulated, displaying low activity in a wildtype (wt) host background and 
high activity in the srl deletion mutant background. The srlA promoter includes 
a conserved inverted repeat directly upstream of the predicted -35 subsequence. 
A mutational analysis demonstrated that the site is required for the high 
promoter activity in the srlA deletion background. Electromobility shift assays 
using purified wildtype CenR response regulator and a D55E phosphomimetic 
derivative suggest this protein acts as a likely Class II activator by binding 
promoter DNA. These results document the first identified CenK-CenR regulon 
member in S. meliloti and demonstrate this two-component regulatory system and 
gene srlA influences cellular growth and persistence under certain 
stress-inducing conditions.

Upregulation of leucine-rich alpha-2 glycoprotein: A key regulator of 
inflammation and joint fibrosis in patients with severe knee osteoarthritis.

Sarkar A(1)(2), Chakraborty D(1)(2), Kumar V(3), Malhotra R(3), Biswas S(1).

INTRODUCTION: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease of the joints mainly 
affecting older individuals. Since the etiology behind the progression of OA is 
not well understood, several associated consequences, such as synovial joint 
stiffness and its progression due to joint fibrosis, are still poorly 
understood. Although a lot of developments have been achieved in the diagnosis 
and management of OA, synovial fibrosis remains one of the major challenging 
consequences. The present study was therefore focused on understanding the 
mechanism of synovial fibrosis, which may further contribute to improving 
symptomatic treatments, leading to overall improvements in the treatment 
outcomes of patients with OA.
METHODS: We used advanced proteomic techniques including isobaric tag for 
relative and absolute quantitation and sequential window acquisition of all 
theoretical mass spectra for the identification of differentially expressed 
proteins in the plasma samples of patients with OA. An in silico study was 
carried out to evaluate the association of the identified proteins with their 
biological processes related to fibrosis and remodeling of the extracellular 
matrix (ECM). The most significantly upregulated protein was then validated by 
Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The target protein was then 
further investigated for its role in inflammation and joint fibrosis using an in 
vitro study model.
RESULTS: Leucine-rich alpha-2 glycoprotein (LRG1) was found to be the most 
highly differentially expressed upregulated (9.4-fold) protein in the plasma 
samples of patients with OA compared to healthy controls. The knockdown of LRG1 
followed by in vitro studies revealed that this protein promotes the secretion 
of the ECM in synovial cells and actively plays a role in wound healing and cell 
migration. The knockdown of LRG1 further confirmed the reduction of the 
inflammatory- and fibrosis-related markers in primary cells.
CONCLUSION: LRG1 was identified as a highly significant upregulated protein in 
the plasma samples of patients with OA. It was found to be associated with 
increased fibrosis and cell migration, leading to enhanced inflammation and 
joint stiffness in OA pathogenesis.

Melittin Tryptophan Substitution with a Fluorescent Amino Acid Reveals the 
Structural Basis of Selective Antitumor Effect and Subcellular Localization in 
Tumor Cells.

Melittin is a membrane-active peptide with strong anticancer activity against 
various cancers. Despite decades of research, the role of the singular Trp in 
the anticancer activity and selectivity of melittin remains poorly understood. 
Here, we propose a theranostic solution based on the substitution of Trp19 with 
a noncanonical fluorescent amino acid (DapAMCA). The introduction of DapAMCA 
residue in melittin stabilized the helical structure of the peptide, as 
evaluated by circular dichroism spectra and molecular dynamics simulations. In 
vitro hemolytic and anticancer activity assays revealed that introducing DapAMCA 
residue in melittin changed its mode of action with the cell membrane, resulting 
in reduced hemolytic toxicity and an improved the selectivity index (SI), with 
up to a five-fold increase compared to melittin. In vitro fluorescence imaging 
of DapAMCA-labeled melittin (MELFL) in cancer cells demonstrated high 
membrane-penetrating activity, with strong nuclear and nucleolar localization 
ability. These findings provide implications for novel anticancer therapies 
based on Trp-substituted designs and nuclear/nucleolar targeted therapy.

PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway and exhibits anticoagulant effects with 
antimicrobial properties.

A(3), Ghanim M(3), Murad H(2), Modallal A(2), Shalabni K(2).

Background: Arum palaestinum Boiss (AP) is a wild plant in Palestine whose 
leaves have a long history as food and medicine in Middle Eastern countries. The 
current study aimed to evaluate the biological characteristics of AP flower 
extract, including its antimicrobial and coagulation cascade activities and its 
effects on anticancer molecular pathways. Methods: The antimicrobial activity of 
the aqueous extract of AP flowers was assessed using a microdilution assay 
against eight pathogens. The coagulation properties were assessed by prothrombin 
time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and thrombin time (TT) 
tests using standard hematological methods. The biological effects of AP on 
hepatocellular carcinoma were measured by assessing the impact of AP on cell 
cycle, proliferation (CFSE), apoptosis (annexin-v+/PI), and tumorigenicity (αFP 
and HBsAg), as well as its effects on the PI3K-AKT-mTOR molecular signaling 
pathway. Results: The antimicrobial screening results revealed that the aqueous 
extract of AP had potent antibacterial effects against P. vulgaris and E. 
faecium compared to ampicillin, with MIC values of 6.25, 6.25, and 18 μg/mL, 
respectively. Moreover, the AP aqueous extract exerted anticoagulant activity, 
with significant prolonged results in the aPTT and TT tests (25 μg/mL and 
50 μg/mL, respectively) and slightly prolonged results in the PT test 
(50 μg/mL). The anticancer results indicated a delay in the cell cycle through 
decreased cell proliferation rates following incubation with AP fractions. The 
effect of the aqueous fraction was most evident in a delay in the S phase. The 
aqueous and DMSO fractions maintained the cells in the G2-M phase, similar to 
the DOX, while the flower extract in methanol accelerated the cells in the G2-M 
phase, suggesting that AF flower extracts may have anti-cancer properties. The 
aqueous extract of AP 1) reduced secretions of HCC αFP by 1.55-fold and 3.3-fold 
at the 50 and 100 μg/mL concentrations, respectively (p = 0.0008); 2) decreased 
phosphorylation in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway (p < 0.05); and 3) 
shifted cells from necrosis to apoptosis by 50% and 70% at the 50 and 100 μg/mL 
concentrations, respectively (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The results of this study 
showed the activities of the bioactive components for the treatment of 
infectious diseases and blood coagulation disorders, which could also be a 
potential therapeutic approach for delaying HCC tumorigenicity.

Nutrients, Phytochemicals and In Vitro Disease Prevention of Nephelium 
hypoleucum Kurz Fruit.

Luu LK(1), Thangsiri S(1), Sahasakul Y(1), Aursalung A(1), Inthachat W(1), 
Temviriyanukul P(1), On-Nom N(1), Chupeerach C(1), Suttisansanee U(1).

Nephelium hypoleucum Kurz is an evergreen tree in the Sapindaceae family, mostly 
found in the forests of some Southeast Asia countries, especially Thailand. The 
lack of biological information regarding this tree has led to inappropriate 
agricultural management, conservation and utilization. Thus, this study aims to 
examine the nutritional composition, organic acid and phenolic profiles and in 
vitro health properties through several key enzyme inhibitions against some 
civilization diseases including Alzheimer's disease (β-secretase (BACE-1), 
butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE)), obesity (lipase), 
hypertension (angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)) and diabetes (dipeptidyl 
peptidase-IV (DPP-IV), α-amylase and α-glucosidase) on the aril (flesh) part of 
N. hypoleucum Kurz fruit. The remaining fruit parts including the pericarp 
(peel) and seed were also assessed as sources of potential phenolics as well as 
key enzyme inhibitors. As results, carbohydrate (17.18 g) was found to be a 
major source of energy (74.80 kcal) in the aril (100 g fresh weight), with trace 
amounts of protein (0.78 g) and fat (0.32 g). The fruit aril also contained high 
insoluble dietary fiber (5.02 g) and vitamin C (11.56 mg), while potassium 
(215.82 mg) was detected as the major mineral. Organic acid profile indicated 
that the aril was rich in citric acid, while the phenolic profile suggested 
predominant quercetin and kaempferol. Interestingly, high gallic acid contents 
were detected in both pericarp and seed, with the latter 3.2-fold higher than 
the former. The seed also possessed the highest total phenolic content (TPC, 
149.45 mg gallic acid equivalent/g dry weight), while total anthocyanin content 
(TAC, 0.21 mg cyanidin-3-O-glucoside equivalent/g dry weight) was only detected 
in pericarp. High TPC also led to high enzyme inhibitory activities in seed 
including BACE-1, AChE, BChE, ACE, DPP-IV and α-glucosidase. Interestingly, aril 
with the highest α-amylase inhibition suggested strong inhibitory distribution, 
predominantly from quercetin and kaempferol. Lipase inhibitory activities were 
only detected in the aril and pericarp, suggesting the biological function of 
these two phenolics and possibly anthocyanins.

Thermostability engineering of an inulin fructotransferase for the biosynthesis 
of difructose anhydride I.

Cheng M(1), Huang Z(1), Zhang W(1), Kim BG(2), Mu W(3).

The thermostability of enzymes is an essential factor that performs a vital role 
during practical applications. Inulin fructotransferases can efficiently convert 
inulin into bio-functional difructose anhydrides (DFAs). The present study aimed 
to improve the thermostability of a previously reported inulin 
fructotransferase, SpIFTase, and apply it to the biosynthesis of DFA I. In 
silico rational design was used to predict mutation sites, based on sequential 
and structural information. Two triple-site mutants, Q69L/Q234L/K310G and 
E201I/Q234L/K310G, were characterized and exhibited enhanced thermostability 
with approximately 5 °C higher in melting temperature (Tm), respectively, and a 
45-fold longer half-life (t1/2) at 70 °C, compared to that of SpIFTase. 
Molecular dynamic simulations and elaborate structural analysis suggested that 
the combinations of hydrophobic interaction, electrostatic potential 
distribution, and decreased flexibility via stabilization of loops and α-helix 
improved the thermostability of SpIFTase. Additionally, the promising mutants 
exhibited great potential to the industrial production of DFA I.

Computational Study of Driving Forces in ATSP, PDIQ, and P53 Peptide Binding: 
C═O···C═O Tetrel Bonding Interactions at Work.

Lang L(1), Frontera A(2), Perez A(1), Bauzá A(2).

Understanding the molecular interactions that drive peptide folding is crucial 
to chemistry and biology. In this study, we analyzed the role of CO···CO tetrel 
bonding (TtB) interactions in the folding mechanism of three different peptides 
(ATSP, pDIQ, and p53), which exhibit a different propensity to fold in an α 
helix motif. To achieve this goal, we used both a recently developed Bayesian 
inference approach (MELDxMD) and Quantum Mechanics (QM) calculations at the 
RI-MP2/def2-TZVP level of theory. These techniques allowed us to study the 
folding process and to evaluate the strength of the CO···CO TtBs as well as the 
synergies between TtBs and hydrogen-bonding (HB) interactions. We believe that 
the results derived from our study will be helpful for those scientists working 
in computational biology, peptide chemistry, and structural biology.

Optimization of Triterpene Yield from Ganoderma atrum HBSD Z19 (Agaricomycetes) 
by Optimization of Medium Components and Evaluation of Bioactivity Under 
Simulated Gastrointestinal Digestion In Vitro.

Dong R(1), Qiao J(2), Song S(3), Zhuansun W(2), Hu Y(2), Zeng X(2), Xin B(2), 
Weng Q(2), Zeng H(1), Yin X(4).

The intracellular triterpene yield from Ganoderma atrum was enhanced by 
optimization based on single-factor experiments, Plackett-Burman experimental 
design (PBED) and response surface methodology (RSM) under liquid fermentation 
conditions. The optimal medium composition (g·L-1) was glucose (46.0), bean cake 
powder (30.2), KH2PO4 (2.0), CaCl2 (3.0), MgSO4 (1.5), FeSO4 (0.2), and pH 6.0. 
Under the optimal conditions, the highest triterpene yield of 0.527 g·L-1 was 
obtained, which was 4.705-fold higher than before optimization. The fermented 
powder that was collected from the optimal medium was subjected to simulated 
gastrointestinal digestion, with differences resulting from extraction in 
different digestive juices (purified water, simulated gastric digestive juice, 
simulated gastrointestinal digestive juice). The content of triterpenes and 
polysaccharides increased, except for total phenol content. In terms of the 
antioxidant activity, the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical 
2,2-diphenyl-1-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl) hydrazyl (DPPH+⋅) scavenging activity 
gradually decreased whereas the 2, 2'-azino-bis 
(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS+⋅) scavenging activity first 
decreased and then increased. In terms of enzyme viability, the activity of 
α-amylase (α-AL) and α-glucosidase (α-GC) in the digestive juices decreased 
dramatically. The main bioactive components of G. atrum and their bioactivity in 
digestive juices were evaluated, providing a reference for the effective use of 
fermented power from G. atrum.

streptozotocin-diabetic rats by activating AMPK.

ALTamimi JZ(1), Alshammari GM(2), AlFaris NA(1), Alagal RI(1), Aljabryn DH(1), 
Albekairi NA(3), Alkhateeb MA(4), Yahya MA(2).

CONTEXT: Ellagic acid (EA) is used in traditional medicine to treated 
hyperlipidaemia.
OBJECTIVE: This study examined if AMPK mediates the anti-steatotic effect of 
ellagic acid (EA) in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetes mellitus in 
rats.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult male Wistar rats (130 ± 10 g) were divided into 6 
groups (n = 8 rats/group) as control, control + EA, control + EA + CC an AMPK 
inhibitor), T1DM, T1DM + EA, and T1DM + EA + CC. The treatments with EA 
(50 mg/kg/orally) and CC (200 ng/rat/i.p.) were given the desired groups for 12 
weeks, daily.
RESULTS: In T1DM-rats, EA reduced fasting glucose levels (44.8%), increased 
fasting insulin levels (92.8%), prevented hepatic lipid accumulation, and 
decreased hepatic and serum levels of total triglycerides (54% & 61%), 
cholesterol (57% & 48%), and free fatty acids (40% & 37%). It also reduced 
hepatic levels of ROS (62%), MDA (52%), TNF-α (62%), and IL-6 (57.2%) and the 
nuclear activity of NF-κB p65 (54%) but increased the nuclear activity of Nrf-2 
(4-fold) and levels of GSH (107%) and SOD (87%). Besides, EA reduced 
downregulated SREBP1 (35%), SREBP2 (34%), ACC-1 (36%), FAS (38%), and HMG-CoAR 
(49%) but stimulated mRNA levels of PPARα (1.7-fold) and CPT1a (1.8-fold), CPT1b 
(2.9-fold), and p-AMPK (4-fold). All these events were prevented by the 
co-administration of CC.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: These findings encourage the use of EA to treat 
hepatic disorders, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Further 
in vivo and in vitro studies are needed to validate its potential in clinical 
medicine.

Bioavailability, anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic effect of Acetyl Keto 
Boswellic acid and its combination with methotrexate in an arthritic animal 
model.

Banji D(1), Banji OJF(2), Rashida S(3), Alshahrani S(4), Alqahtani SS(5).

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Rheumatoid arthritis is one of the most common 
disabling chronic progressive autoimmune diseases affecting the adult world 
population. Boswellia serrata has been a known anti-inflammatory agent since 
ancient times. Therefore, research on Boswellia extract based on Acetyl Keto 
Boswellic Acid (AKBA) content evaluating its efficacy and safety is necessary. 
The study aimed to find a suitable Boswellia extract rich in AKBA to evaluate 
its bioavailability, anti-inflammatory, and anti-arthritic effect. In addition, 
the synergistic action of AKBA extract with methotrexate (MTX) was also assessed 
on an animal model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Oral bioavailability of AKBA and the anti-inflammatory 
activity of 10% AKBA (5, 10, 20, 40 mg/kg b.w) was assessed and compared with 2% 
AKBA (40 mg/kg) and diclofenac (10 mg/kg). The effect of 10% AKBA at 20 mg/kg 
and 40 mg/kg was evaluated in the FCA induced arthritis animal model alone and 
combined with methotrexate (MTX) at 2 mg/kg b.w. Subplantar injection of FCA 
produced edema within a few hours with progressive arthritis by the 9th day 
after injection. All the treatments were initiated from the 10th day until the 
45th day. Oral administration of 10% AKBA was done daily and MTX by 
intraperitoneal route once a week from day 10 to day 45. Paw volume, erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate (ESR), serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum 
glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total 
bilirubin, oxidative markers (superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels, malondialdehyde 
(MDA), total proteins and liver histopathology were examined.
RESULTS: 10% AKBA provided 8.48-fold, 24.22-fold, 47.36-fold, and 110.53-fold 
higher AUC (0-α) of AKBA at 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg, 
respectively compared to 2% AKBA at 40 mg/kg. Percentage paw edema inhibition of 
10% AKBA at 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg were significantly higher than 2% regular AKBA 
(40 mg/kg) and diclofenac (10 mg/kg). 10% AKBA at a dose of 20 and 40 mg/kg 
significantly reduced ESR compared with FCA treated group. A combination of 
methotrexate with 10% AKBA showed the highest reduction in ESR. 10% AKBA at both 
dose levels significantly reduced hepatic marker enzymes and total bilirubin 
levels. Treatment with 10% AKBA showed a significant increase in total proteins, 
antioxidant enzymes and a decrease in malondialdehyde levels. Similarly, 10% 
AKBA protected the hepatocytes compared with the FCA and FCA + MTX treated 
group. 10% AKBA was capable of significantly minimizing FCA and FCA + MTX 
induced changes.
CONCLUSION: Anti-inflammatory activity of AKBA due to inhibition of lipoxygenase 
(LOX) enzymes supports the use of AKBA in inflammatory disorders. Combination 
therapy of 10% AKBA with MTX is effective in inhibiting arthritis and 
circumventing hepatotoxicity produced by MTX in arthritic animals.

Increased nitrate intake from beetroot juice does not alter soluble cellular 
adhesion molecules and circulating inflammatory cytokines in individuals with 
treated hypertension: a randomised, controlled trial.

K(3), Neubauer O(8)(9)(10), Hodgson JM(1)(2), Bondonno CP(1)(2).

Dietary nitrate, found predominantly in green leafy vegetables and other 
vegetables such as radish, celery, and beetroot, has been shown to beneficially 
modulate inflammatory processes and immune cell function in animals and healthy 
individuals. The impact of increased nitrate intake on soluble inflammatory 
mediators in individuals with hypertension is unclear. We assessed whether the 
daily consumption of dietary nitrate via beetroot juice for 1-week lowered 
levels of circulating inflammatory markers in men and women with treated 
hypertension. Twenty-seven male and female participants were recruited to a 
randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover trial. The effects of 
1-week intake of nitrate-rich beetroot juice versus 1-week intake of 
nitrate-depleted beetroot juice (placebo) were investigated. Plasma 
concentrations of circulating soluble adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, CD62E, 
CD62P), inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, TNF-α) and 
chemokines (IL-8, MCP-1) were measured by multiplex flow cytometric bead array 
in samples collected on day 7 of each intervention period. Other outcomes 
included alterations in nitrate metabolism assessed by measuring nitrate and 
nitrite concentrations in plasma, saliva, and urine. One week of beetroot juice 
did not alter levels of the soluble adhesion markers or cytokines assessed. A 
7-fold increase in salivary nitrite, an 8-fold increase in salivary nitrate, a 
3-fold increase in plasma nitrate and nitrite, and a 4-fold increase in urinary 
nitrate and nitrite compared to the placebo was observed (p < 0.001 for all 
comparisons). Increasing dietary nitrate consumption over 7 days is not 
effective in reducing soluble inflammatory mediators in individuals with treated 
hypertension. This trial was registered at anzctr.org.au as ACTRN 
12613000116729.

Dysregulation of peripheral monocytes and pro-inflammation of alpha-synuclein in 
Parkinson's disease.

B(1)(3), Mao C(7)(8)(9)(10), Xu Y(11)(12)(13).

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Mounting evidence indicates the involvement of the 
innate immune system in Parkinson's disease (PD). Nevertheless, the implications 
of peripheral monocytes have not been fully elucidated. Although alpha-synuclein 
(α-synuclein) has been described as a pathological hallmark of PD, the 
proinflammatory effect of α-synuclein on monocytes is understudied. This study 
aimed to comprehensively characterize peripheral monocytes in PD patients and to 
investigate the proinflammatory magnitude of fibrillar α-synuclein.
METHODS: Using flow cytometry, we explored the distribution of monocytic 
subpopulations. We also investigated the actions of peripheral monocytes in 
response to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and to fibrillar α-synuclein stimuli by 
measuring inflammatory molecule levels in post-culture supernatants.
RESULTS: Classical monocytes were enriched, in parallel with lower proportions 
of intermediate and nonclassical monocytes in patients with PD than in controls. 
Lower levels of TNF-α and IL-6 were spontaneously produced by unstimulated 
monocytes in patients with PD. LPS and fibrillar α-synuclein stimuli induced 
high levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and sCD163 in the PD and control groups. 
Strikingly, the fold induction of TNF-α and IL-6 was lower in patients with PD 
than that in normal controls under the same stimulation.
CONCLUSION: Our results revealed a strong dysregulation of peripheral monocytes 
in PD patients, including subpopulation shifts and impaired response to specific 
stimuli, and the proinflammatory effect of α-synuclein on monocytes. Further 
studies are needed to clarify the specific mechanisms by which these 
immunological abnormalities are present in PD to open the possibility of 
immunoregulatory therapy.

Epoxy-α-lapachone (ELAP), an oxirane-functionalized molecule synthesized from 
naturally occurring lapachol, has shown promising activity against murine 
infection with Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis. Herein, we report the 
successful development of oil-in-water-type (o/w) microemulsions (ME) loaded 
with ELAP (ELAP-ME) using Capmul MCM, Labrasol, and PEG 400. Stability studies 
revealed that ELAP-ME (100 µg/mL of ELAP), which was comprised of globule size 
smaller than 120.4 ± 7.7 nm, displayed a good stability profile over 73 days. 
ELAP-ME had an effect in BALB/c mice infected with L. (L.) amazonensis, causing 
reductions in paw lesions after two weeks of treatment (∼2-fold) when compared 
to untreated animals. Furthermore, there was also a reduction in the parasite 
load both in the footpad (60.3%) and in the lymph nodes (31.5%). Based on these 
findings, ELAP-ME emerges as a promising treatment for tegumentar leishmaniasis.

α-Ketoglutarate is a key biomolecule involved in a number of metabolic 
pathways─most notably the TCA cycle. Abnormal α-ketoglutarate metabolism has 
also been linked with cancer. Here, isotopic labeling was employed to synthesize 
[1-13C,5-12C,D4]α-ketoglutarate with the future goal of utilizing its 
[1-13C]-hyperpolarized state for real-time metabolic imaging of α-ketoglutarate 
analytes and its downstream metabolites in vivo. The signal amplification by 
reversible exchange in shield enables alignment transfer to heteronuclei 
(SABRE-SHEATH) hyperpolarization technique was used to create 9.7% [1-13C] 
polarization in 1 minute in this isotopologue. The efficient 13C 
hyperpolarization, which utilizes parahydrogen as the source of nuclear spin 
order, is also supported by favorable relaxation dynamics at 0.4 μT field (the 
optimal polarization transfer field): the exponential 13C polarization buildup 
constant Tb is 11.0 ± 0.4 s whereas the 13C polarization decay constant T1 is 
18.5 ± 0.7 s. An even higher 13C polarization value of 17.3% was achieved using 
natural-abundance α-ketoglutarate disodium salt, with overall similar relaxation 
dynamics at 0.4 μT field, indicating that substrate deuteration leads only to a 
slight increase (∼1.2-fold) in the relaxation rates for 13C nuclei separated by 
three chemical bonds. Instead, the gain in polarization (natural abundance 
versus [1-13C]-labeled) is rationalized through the smaller heat capacity of the 
"spin bath" comprising available 13C spins that must be hyperpolarized by the 
same number of parahydrogen present in each sample, in line with previous 15N 
SABRE-SHEATH studies. Remarkably, the C-2 carbon was not hyperpolarized in both 
α-ketoglutarate isotopologues studied; this observation is in sharp contrast 
with previously reported SABRE-SHEATH pyruvate studies, indicating that the 
catalyst-binding dynamics of C-2 in α-ketoglutarate differ from that in 
pyruvate. We also demonstrate that 13C spectroscopic characterization of 
α-ketoglutarate and pyruvate analytes can be performed at natural 13C abundance 
with an estimated detection limit of 80 micromolar concentration × *%P13C. All 
in all, the fundamental studies reported here enable a wide range of research 
communities with a new hyperpolarized contrast agent potentially useful for 
metabolic imaging of brain function, cancer, and other metabolically challenging 
diseases.

N-Rhodanine Glycosides Derivatives as Potent DNA Intercalation and Topo II 
Inhibition against Cancer Cells.

Nitrogen and sulfur glycosylation was carried out via the reaction of rhodanine 
(1) with α-acetobromoglucose 3 under basic conditions. Deacetylation of the 
protected nitrogen nucleoside 4 was performed with CH3ONa in CH3OH without 
cleavage of the rhodanine ring to afford the deprotected nitrogen nucleoside 6. 
Further, deacetylation of the protected sulfur nucleoside 5 was performed with 
CH3ONa in CH3OH with the cleavage of the rhodanine ring to give the hydrolysis 
product 7. The protected nitrogen nucleosides 11a-f were produced by condensing 
the protected nitrogen nucleoside 4 with the aromatic aldehydes 10a-f in C2H5OH 
while using morpholine as a secondary amine catalyst. Deacetylation of the 
protected nitrogen nucleosides 11a-f was performed with NaOCH3/CH3OH without 
cleavage of the rhodanine ring to afford the deprotected nitrogen nucleosides 
12a-f. NMR spectroscopy was used to designate the anomers' configurations. To 
examine the electrical and geometric properties derived from the stable 
structure of the examined compounds, molecular modeling and DFT calculations 
using the B3LYP/6-31+G (d,p) level were carried out. The quantum chemical 
descriptors and experimental findings showed a strong connection. The IC50 
values for most compounds were very encouraging when evaluated against MCF-7, 
HepG2, and A549 cancer cells. Interestingly, IC50 values for 11a, 12b, and 12f 
were much lower than those for Doxorubicin (7.67, 8.28, 6.62 μM): (3.7, 8.2, 9.8 
μM), (3.1, 13.7, 21.8 μM), and (7.17, 2.2, 4.5 μM), respectively. Against Topo 
II inhibition and DNA intercalation, when compared to Dox (IC50 = 9.65 and 31.27 
μM), compound 12f showed IC50 values of 7.3 and 18.2 μM, respectively. In 
addition, compound 12f induced a 65.6-fold increase in the rate of apoptotic 
cell death in HepG2 cells, with the cell cycle being arrested in the G2/M phase 
as a result. Additionally, it upregulated the apoptosis-mediated genes of P53, 
Bax, and caspase-3,8,9 by 9.53, 8.9, 4.16, 1.13, and 8.4-fold change, while it 
downregulated the Bcl-2 expression by 0.13-fold. Therefore, glucosylated 
Rhodanines may be useful as potential therapeutic candidates against cancer 
because of their topoisomerase II and DNA intercalation activity.

computing techniques.

Ghordoyee Milan S(6).

This study aimed to predict evaporation from dam reservoirs using artificial 
intelligence considering climate change. Mahabad Dam, near Lake Urmia, in 
northwestern Iran, is used to investigate the proposed approach. There are three 
parts to the study presented herein. In the first part, two machine learning 
models, namely group method of data handling (GMDH) and least squares support 
vector regression (LS-SVR), were used to model the inflow to the dam reservoir. 
Temperature, precipitation, and inflow during the previous month from 1990 to 
2017 were used as input data. In the second part, the evaporation from the dam 
reservoir was modeled using the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) 
and optimized ANFIS using Harris hawks optimization (HHO) and the arithmetic 
optimization algorithm (AOA) optimization algorithms. The input parameters in 
this part were temperature, precipitation, inflow to the dam reservoir, along 
with evaporation from the dam reservoir in the previous month. In the third 
part, precipitation and temperature were predicted using the fifth report of 
IPCC based on RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios for the period 2020-2040. Out 
of 28 models presented in the fifth report, EC-ERATH and FIO-ESM had the 
greatest similarity with observational data of temperature and precipitation, 
respectively. The results of scatter plots and Taylor's diagram showed the 
higher performance of LS-SVR (root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute 
percentage error (MAPE), and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 8.65, 4.69, and 
0.96) compared to GMDH (RMSE, MAPE, and NSE of 11.65, 7.81, and 0.93) in 
modeling the inflow. Moreover, both hybrid modes (AOA-ANFIS and HHO-ANFIS) 
improved the performance of ANFIS in modeling the evaporation from the dam 
reservoir. The RMSE, MAPE, and NSE values for ANFIS were 0.56, 0.52, and 0.89, 
respectively, while these values for the AOA-ANFIS (RMSE, MAPE, and NSE of 0.31, 
0.24, and 0.93) and HHO-ANFIS (RMSE, MAPE, and NSE of 0.20, 0.30, and 0.96) were 
improved remarkably. The impact of climate change reduced the inflow to the dam 
reservoir by about 0.45, 0.80, and 1.7 MCM in RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 
scenarios, respectively. Also, the effect of climate change caused the 
evaporation from the dam reservoir to increase by about 0.2, 0.9, and 1 MCM in 
RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. The findings of this study 
show that the correct management of dam reservoirs needs to consider the 
potential effects of climate change in the future. Moreover, the hybrid machine 
learning models used in this study can be used to predict the amount of 
evaporation in other reservoirs.

The holistic approach to the CHRNA7 gene, hsa-miR-3158-5p, and 15q13.3 hotspot 
CNVs in migraineurs.

Yasin S(1), Görücü Yılmaz Ş(2), Geyik S(1), Oğuzkan Balcı S(3).

Migraine is a neurological disease characterized by severe headache attacks. 
Combinations of different genetic variations such as copy number variation (CNV) 
in a gene and microRNA (miRNA) expression can provide a holistic approach to the 
disease as a pathophysiological, diagnostic, and therapeutic target. CNVs, the 
Cholinergic Receptor Nicotinic Alpha 7 Subunit (CHRNA7) gene, and expression of 
gene-targeting miRNAs (hsa-miR-548e-5p and hsa-miR-3158-5p) in migraineurs (n = 
102; with aura, n = 43; without aura, n = 59) and non-migraines (n = 120) aged 
15-60 years, comparative, case-control study was conducted. Genetic markers were 
compared with biochemical parameters (BMI, WBC, Urea, GFR, ESR, CRP, HBG). All 
analyzes were performed by quantitative Real-Time PCR (q-PCR) and fold change 
was calculated with the 2-ΔΔCT method. The diagnostic power of the CHRNA7 gene, 
CNV, and miRNAs were analyzed with the receiver operating curve (ROC). CHRNA7 
gene and hsa-miR-3158-5p are down-regulated in migraineurs and the gene is 
controlled by this miRNA via CNVs (p < .05). Both deletion and duplication were 
detected in patients with migraine for CVN numbers (p = .05). The number of CNV 
deletions was higher than duplications. When CHRNA7-CNV-hsa-miR-3158-5p was 
modeled together in the ROC analysis, the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.805, 
and the diagnostic power was "good". In migraineurs, the CHRNA7 gene can be 
controlled by hsa-miR-3158-5p via CNVs to modulate the mechanism of pain. These 
three genetic markers have diagnostic potential and may be used in antimigraine 
treatments.

J(6), Zhang S(7).

Distillers' grains of Chinese Baijiu (DGS) presents a significant challenge to 
the environmentally-friendly production of the brewing industry. This study 
utilized screw extrusion to modify the morphological and crystalline 
characteristics of DGS, resulting in a 316 % increase in the yield of 
non-digestible polysaccharides extraction. Physiochemical characteristics of 
extracted polysaccharides were variated, including infrared spectrum, 
monosaccharide composition, and molecular weight. Polysaccharides extracted from 
extruded DGS exhibited enhanced inhibitory capacity on α-amylase activity and 
starch hydrolyzation, as compared to those extracted from unextruded DGS. 
Additionally, the ABTS, DPPH, and OH radical scavenging efficiencies took a 
maximum increase of 1.20, 1.38, and 1.02-fold, correspondingly. Extrusion is a 
novel approach for the recycling non-digestible polysaccharides from DGS, 
augmenting the bioactivity of extracts and their potential application in 
functional food.

Asiaticoside polymeric nanoparticles for effective diabetic wound healing 
through increased collagen biosynthesis: In-vitro and in-vivo evaluation.

Narisepalli S(1), Salunkhe SA(1), Chitkara D(1), Mittal A(2).

Asiaticoside (AST) is a naturally available phytoconstituent that enables 
effective wound healing mainly by promoting collagen biosynthesis. However, the 
physicochemical nature of AST such as high molecular weight (959.12 g/mol), poor 
water solubility and poor permeability limits its therapeutic effects. This 
study aims to develop Asiaticoside polymeric nanoparticles (AST PNP) embedded in 
a gelatin based biodegradable hydrogel (15 % w/v) for application in the wound 
cavity to enable sustained release of AST and enhance its therapeutic effects. 
The AST PNP were fabricated in the desired size range (168.4 nm; PDI (0.09)) and 
the morphology, rate of fluid uptake, rate of water loss, and water vapor 
transmission rate of AST PNP incorporated hydrogel were determined. AST PNP gel 
showed porous structural morphology and possessed ideal characteristics as a 
graft for wound healing. The drug release kinetics and cellular uptake of AST 
PNP were investigated wherein, AST PNP demonstrated sustained release profile 
upto 24 h in comparison to free AST (complete release within 6 h) and exhibited 
an enhanced intra-cellular uptake in fibroblasts within 3 h compared to the free 
drug. In-vitrocell culture studies also demonstrated significant proliferation 
and migration of fibroblasts in the presence of AST PNP. Additionally, AST PNP 
gel upon application to the wounds of diabetic rats depicted improved wound 
healing efficacy in terms of improved collagen biosynthesis, upregulated COL-1 
protein level (∼1.85 fold vs free AST), and enhanced expression of α-SMA 
compared to control groups. Altogether, formulation of AST as polymeric 
nanoparticles in a gel based carrier offered significant improvement in the 
therapeutic properties of AST for the management of diabetic wounds.

LncRNA FLG-AS1 Mitigates Diabetic Retinopathy by Regulating Retinal Epithelial 
Cell Inflammation, Oxidative Stress, and Apoptosis via miR-380-3p/SOCS6 Axis.

Luo R(1), Li L(2), Xiao F(2), Fu J(2).

The objective of this study is to investigate lncRNA FLG-AS1-mediated 
miR-380-3p/SOCS6 axis in inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis of 
retinal epithelial cells in diabetic retinopathy (DR). Fasting blood was 
collected from 60 DR patients and 60 healthy controls. The Pearson correlation 
was used to analyze the correlation between the expression levels of FLG-AS1 and 
miR-380-3p in DR patients. qRT-PCR and/or Western blotting were used to detect 
the expression of FLG-AS1, miR-380-3p, and SOCS6. After gain of function of 
FLG-AS1 or SOCS6 or loss of function of miR-380-3p, high glucose (HG)-treated 
human retinal pigment epithelial ARPE-19 cells were subjected to TUNEL 
assessment of apoptosis. ELISA was performed to detect the expression levels of 
IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in cell culture supernatant. DCFH-DA was used to detect 
the level of ROS in the cells. MDA and SOD assay kits were used to measure the 
activity of MDA and SOD in the cells. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was 
performed to verify the binding between miR-380-3p and FLG-AS1 or between 
miR-380-3p and SOCS6. Streptozotocin injections were used to induce diabetes in 
rats which were injected with FLG-AS1 overexpression lentiviral vectors in the 
eye. Twenty weeks later, retinal tissue was isolated and stained with 
hematoxylin-eosin or TUNEL. Compared to that in healthy controls, FLG-AS1 
expression decreased 2.5-fold and miR-380-3p expression increased 2.6-fold in 
the serum of DR patients. The expression levels of FLG-AS1 and miR-380-3p were 
negatively correlated in DR patients (r = -0.3772, P = 0.003). Overexpression of 
FLG-AS1 reduced inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis of HG-treated 
ARPE-19 cells and alleviated retinal injury in diabetic rats. FLG-AS1 promoted 
the expression of SOCS6 by targeting miR-380-3p. Inhibition of miR-380-3p or 
overexpression of SOCS6 reduced inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis of 
HG-treated ARPE-19 cells. FLG-AS1 mitigates DR by regulating retinal epithelial 
cell inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis via the miR-380-3p/SOCS6 
axis.

Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Modeling To Predict Drug-Biologic 
Interactions with Cytokine Modulators: Are These Relevant and Is Interleukin-6 
Enough?

Chen KF(1), Jones HM(1), Gill KL(2).

Drugs that modulate cytokine levels are often used for the treatment of cancer 
as well as inflammatory or immunologic disorders. Pharmacokinetic drug-biologic 
interactions (DBIs) may arise from suppression or elevation of cytochrome P450 
(P450) enzymes caused by the increase or decrease in cytokine levels after 
administration of these therapies. There is in vitro and in vivo evidence that 
demonstrates a clear link between raised interleukin (IL)-6 levels and P450 
suppression, in particular CYP3A4. However, despite this, the changes in IL-6 
levels in vivo rarely lead to significant drug interactions (area under the 
curve and Cmax ratios < 2-fold). The clinical significance of such interactions 
therefore remains questionable and is dependent on the therapeutic index of the 
small molecule therapy. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling 
has been used successfully to predict the impact of raised IL-6 on P450 
activities. Beyond IL-6, published data show little evidence that IL-8, IL-10, 
and IL-17 suppress P450 enzymes. In vitro data suggest that IL-1β, IL-2, tumor 
necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and interferon (IFN)-γ can cause suppression of P450 
enzymes. Despite in vivo there being a link between IL-6 levels and P450 
suppression, the evidence to support a direct effect of IL-2, IL-8, IL-10, 
IL-17, IFN-γ, TNF-α, or vascular endothelial growth factor on P450 activity is 
inconclusive. This commentary will discuss the relevance of such drug-biologic 
interactions and whether current PBPK models considering only IL-6 are 
sufficient. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This commentary summarizes the current in 
vitro and in vivo literature regarding cytokine-mediated cytochrome P450 
suppression and compares the relative suppressive potential of different 
cytokines in reference to interleukin (IL)-6. It also discusses the relevance of 
drug-biologic interactions to therapeutic use of small molecule drugs and 
whether current physiologically based pharmacokinetic models considering only 
IL-6 are sufficient to predict the extent of drug-biologic interactions.

Systematic genetic modifications of cell wall biosynthesis enhanced the 
secretion and surface-display of polysaccharide degrading enzymes in 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Chen N(1), Yang S(2), You D(1), Shen J(1), Ruan B(1), Wu M(3), Zhang J(1), Luo 
X(4), Tang H(5).

Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a robust cell factory to secrete or surface-display 
cellulase and amylase for the conversion of agricultural residues into valuable 
chemicals. Engineering the secretory pathway is a well-known strategy for 
overproducing these enzymes. Although cell wall biosynthesis can be tightly 
linked to the secretory pathway by regulation of all involved processes, the 
effect of its modifications on protein production has not been extensively 
studied. In this study, we systematically studied the effect of engineering cell 
wall biosynthesis on the activity of cellulolytic enzyme β-glucosidase (BGL1) by 
comparing seventy-nine gene knockout S. cerevisiae strains and newly identified 
that inactivation of DFG5, YPK1, FYV5, CCW12 and KRE1 obviously improved BGL1 
secretion and surface-display. Combinatorial modifications of these genes, 
particularly double deletion of FVY5 and CCW12, along with the use of rich 
medium, increased the activity of secreted and surface-displayed BGL1 by 
6.13-fold and 7.99-fold, respectively. Additionally, we applied this strategy to 
improve the activity of the cellulolytic cellobiohydrolase and amylolytic 
α-amylase. Through proteomic analysis coupled with reverse engineering, we found 
that in addition to the secretory pathway, regulation of translation processes 
may also involve in improving enzyme activity by engineering cell wall 
biosynthesis. Our work provides new insight into the construction of a yeast 
cell factory for efficient production of polysaccharide degrading enzymes.

Clinical implications of circulating follistatin-like protein-1 in hemodialysis 
patients.

Kim DK(#)(1), Kang SH(#)(2), Kim JS(1), Kim YG(3), Lee YH(4), Lee DY(5), Ahn 
SY(6), Moon JY(3), Lee SH(3), Jeong KH(1), Hwang HS(7).

Follistatin-like protein-1 (FSTL-1) is secreted glycoprotein, which regulates 
cardiovascular, immune and skeletal system. However, the clinical significance 
of circulating FSTL-1 levels remains unclear in hemodialysis patients. A total 
376 hemodialysis patients were enrolled from June 2016 to March 2020. Plasma 
FSTL-1 level, inflammatory biomarkers, physical performance, and 
echocardiographic findings at baseline were examined. Plasma FSTL-1 levels were 
positively correlated with TNF-α and MCP-1. Handgrip strength showed weak 
positive correlation in male patients only, and gait speed showed no correlation 
with FSTL-1 levels. In multivariate linear regression analysis, FSTL-1 level was 
negatively associated with left ventricular ejection fraction (β =  - 0.36; 
p = 0.011). The cumulative event rate of the composite of CV event and death, 
and cumulative event rate of CV events was significantly greater in FSTL-1 
tertile 3. In multivariate Cox-regression analysis, FSTL-1 tertile 3 was 
associated with a 1.80-fold risk for the composite of CV events and death(95% 
confidence interval (CI) 1.06-3.08), and a 2.28-fold risk for CV events (95% CI 
1.15-4.51) after adjustment for multiple variables. In conclusion, high 
circulating FSTL-1 levels independently predict the composite of CV events and 
death, and FSTL-1 level was independently associated with left ventricular 
systolic dysfunction.

Comparison of two methods for tumour-targeting peptide modification of 
liposomes.

Huang SQ(1), Zhang HM(1), Zhang YC(1), Wang LY(1), Zhang ZR(1), Zhang L(2).

Liposomes decorated with tumour-targeting cell-penetrating peptides can enhance 
specific drug delivery at the tumour site. The TR peptide, 
c(RGDfK)-AGYLLGHINLHHLAHL(Aib)HHIL, is pH-sensitive and actively targets tumour 
cells that overexpress integrin receptor αvβ3, such as B16F10 melanoma cells. 
Liposomes can be modified with the TR peptide by two different methods: 
utilization of the cysteine residue on TR to link DSPE-PEG2000-Mal contained in 
the liposome formula (LIPTR) or decoration of TR with a C18 stearyl chain 
(C18-TR) for direct insertion into the liposomal phospholipid bilayer through 
electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions (LIPC18-TR). We found that both TR 
and C18-TR effectively reversed the surface charge of the liposomes when the 
systems encountered the low pH of the tumour microenvironment, but LIPC18-TR 
exhibited a greater increase in the charge, which led to higher cellular uptake 
efficiency. Correspondingly, the IC50 values of PTX-LIPTR and PTX-LIPC18-TR in 
B16F10 cells in vitro were 2.1-fold and 2.5-fold lower than that of the 
unmodified PTX-loaded liposomes (PTX-LIP), respectively, in an acidic 
microenvironment (pH 6.3). In B16F10 tumour-bearing mice, intravenous 
administration of PTX-LIPTR and PTX-LIPC18-TR (8 mg/kg PTX every other day for a 
total of 4 injections) caused tumour reduction ratios of 39.4% and 56.1%, 
respectively, compared to 20.8% after PTX-LIP administration. Thus, we 
demonstrated that TR peptide modification could improve the antitumour 
efficiency of liposomal delivery systems, with C18-TR presenting significantly 
better results. After investigating different modification methods, our data 
show that selecting an adequate method is vital even when the same molecule is 
used for decoration.

Molecular characterization and in silico analysis of oxalate decarboxylase of 
Pseudomonas sp. OXDC12.

Gupta S(1), Kanwar SS(1).

Oxalate decarboxylase (OxDC) is a Mn-dependent hexameric enzyme that is highly 
important in management of calcium oxalate mediated nephrolithiasis. The present 
study reported the production and purification of OxDC from Pseudomonas sp. 
OXDC12 up to 45.3-fold with an overall yield of 7%. The purified OxDC displayed 
a single band of approximately 40 kDa on SDS-PAGE and 240 kDa on Native-PAGE 
suggesting it to be a hexameric enzyme. The purified OxDC displayed an optimum 
activity at 26 °C and pH 4.5 in the presence of substrate sodium oxalate 
(30 mg/mL) with a Km and Vmax value of 43.9 mM and 8.9 µmol/min, respectively 
and an activation energy of 52.49 kJ/mol. The enzyme activity was significantly 
enhanced by adding o-phenylenediamine to the reaction mixture. OxDC exhibited a 
very low 17 haemolytic activity which suggested a relatively safer therapeutic 
aspect of the tested OxDC. The structure prediction studies of the OxDC revealed 
a tertiary structure with α/β chains that formed the β barrel structure, typical 
of all cupin domains. The Ramachandran plot produced by PROCHECK shows that 
90.5% of the residues are in the most favoured region and hence the OxDC model 
produced was a good one. Docking studies revealed the binding of the metal ions 
and ligands to cluster of three histidine residues in the N terminal domain that 
formed the active site pocket of the enzyme. It was suggested that the histidine 
coordinated Mn2+ ion was critical for substrate recognition and binding and was 
also directly involved in OxDC catalyses.highlightsOxalate decarboxylase (OxDC) 
was successfully purified from Pseudomonas sp. OXDC12 up-to 45.3-fold.The Km and 
Vmax values of the purified OxDC were calculated as 43.9 mM and 8.9 µmol/min, 
respectively.Genre analysis and structure prediction studies revealed the 
presence of β barrel structure typical of all cupin domains. The model exhibited 
a bi-cupin domain that forms the dimer of the homo-hexameric OxDC.Docking 
experiments revealed that the cluster of three HIS residues in the N terminal 
domain of the tested enzyme formed the active site pocket for binding of Mn as 
well as the ligands.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) is still escalating 
throughout the world. However, the level of neutralization of the inactivated 
viral vaccine recipients' sera and convalescent sera against all VOCs, including 
B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 (Gamma), B.1.617.2 (Delta), and B.1.1.529 
(Omicron) remains to be lack of comparative analysis. Therefore, we constructed 
pseudoviruses of five VOCs using a lentiviral-based system and analyzed their 
viral infectivity and neutralization resistance to convalescent and BBIBP-CorV 
vaccinee serum at different times. Our results show that, compared with the 
wild-type strain (WT), five VOC pseudoviruses showed higher infection, of which 
B.1.617.2 and B.1.1.529 variant pseudoviruses exhibited higher infection rates 
than wild-type or other VOC strains, respectively. Sera from 10 vaccinated 
individuals at the 1, 3 and 5-month post second dose or from 10 convalescent at 
14 and 200 days after discharge retained neutralizing activity against all 
strains but exhibited decreased neutralization activity significantly against 
the five VOC variant pseudoviruses over time compared to WT. Notably, 100% 
(30/30) of the vaccinee serum samples showed more than a 2.5-fold reduction in 
neutralizing activity against B.1.1.529, and 90% (18/20) of the convalescent 
serum samples showed more than 2.5-fold reduction in neutralization against 
B.1.1.529. These findings demonstrate the reduced protection against the VOCs in 
vaccinated and convalescent individuals over time, indicating that it is 
necessary to have a booster shot and develop new vaccines capable of eliciting 
broad neutralization antibodies.

Design, synthesis and evaluation of the novel chalcone derivatives with 
2,2-dimethylbenzopyran as HIF-1 inhibitors that possess anti-angiogenic 
potential.

G(4).

Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) as a key mediator in tumor metastasis, 
angiogenesis and poor patient prognosis, has been recognized as an important 
cancer drug target. Up to now, some HIF-1 inhibitors with diverse skeletal 
structures were reported as anticancer agents, mostly natural product-derived 
compounds. In this study, we designed and synthesized a series of chalcone-based 
compounds with 2,2-dimethylbenzopyran using the combination principles to select 
benzopyrans and chalcones natural products. A novel series of chalcone-based 
compounds with 2,2-dimethylbenzopyran were evaluated as HIF-1 inhibitor. HRE 
luciferase reporter assay demonstrated compounds showed superior HIF-1 
inhibitory activity. Among them, compound 16e exhibited the best features: the 
strongest HIF-1 inhibitory activity (IC50 = 2.38 μM, 3-fold higher than that of 
LXH-SYP-7). Meanwhile, it also significantly suppressed migration and 
VEGF-induced invasion of A549 cells in nontoxic concentrations. Additionally, 
tube formation assay demonstrated its anti-angiogenesis activity. Moreover, the 
in vivo study indicated that compound 16e could retard angiogenesis in the 
matrigel plug assay model, and almost no new blood vessels were formed in the 
suppository when it reached 20 μM. Finally, we also performed a subchronic 
toxicity test in which doses up to 50 mg/kg were administered orally for 10 days 
in Kunming mice with no toxic adverse effects and were well tolerated. These 
findings support the further investigation on the anti-invasive and 
anti-angiogenic potential of this class of compounds as HIF-1 inhibitor.

Pharmacological Profile of Difamilast, a Novel Selective Phosphodiesterase 4 
Inhibitor, for Topical Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis.

Hiyama H(1), Arichika N(2), Okada M(2), Koyama N(2), Tahara T(2), Haruta J(2).

PDE4 inhibitors are expected to be anti-inflammatory agents based on their 
mechanism of action, but the application of this drug class is limited by a 
narrow therapeutic window due to adverse effects associated with 
gastrointestinal function. Difamilast, a novel selective phosphodiesterase 4 
(PDE4) inhibitor, demonstrated significant efficacy without adverse reactions 
such as nausea and diarrhea in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) and was 
recently approved in Japan. In this study, we investigated the pharmacological 
and pharmacokinetic properties of difamilast to provide nonclinical data to help 
understand the clinical effects. Difamilast selectively inhibited recombinant 
human PDE4 activity in assays. The IC50 of difamilast against PDE4B, a PDE4 
subtype that plays an important role in the inflammatory response, was 0.0112 
μM, representing a 6.6-fold decrease compared with the IC50 against PDE4D 
(0.0738 μM), a subtype that can trigger emesis. Difamilast inhibited TNF-α 
production in human (IC50 = 0.0109 μM) and mouse (IC50 = 0.0035 μM) peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells and improved skin inflammation in a mouse model of 
chronic allergic contact dermatitis. These effects of difamilast on TNF-α 
production and dermatitis were superior to those of other topical PDE4 
inhibitors: CP-80633, cipamfylline, and crisaborole. In pharmacokinetic studies 
using miniature pigs and rats, the concentrations of difamilast in the blood and 
brain after topical application were not sufficient to support pharmacological 
activity. This nonclinical study contributes to explain the efficacy and safety 
of difamilast with a sufficient therapeutic window in the clinical trials. 
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This is the first report on the nonclinical 
pharmacological profile of difamilast ointment, a novel topical PDE4 inhibitor 
that demonstrated utility in clinical trials in patients with atopic dermatitis. 
Difamilast, which has high PDE4 selectivity (especially for the PDE4B subtype), 
ameliorated chronic allergic contact dermatitis in mice after topical 
application, with a pharmacokinetic profile in animals that suggests few 
systemic side effects; thus, difamilast is a promising new therapeutic treatment 
for atopic dermatitis.

R(3), Caceres RS(#)(2), Bepler T(#)(4)(5), Walsh ME(#)(2)(6).

Therapeutic antibodies are an important and rapidly growing drug modality. 
However, the design and discovery of early-stage antibody therapeutics remain a 
time and cost-intensive endeavor. Here we present an end-to-end Bayesian, 
language model-based method for designing large and diverse libraries of 
high-affinity single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) that are then empirically 
measured. In a head-to-head comparison with a directed evolution approach, we 
show that the best scFv generated from our method represents a 28.7-fold 
improvement in binding over the best scFv from the directed evolution. 
Additionally, 99% of designed scFvs in our most successful library are 
improvements over the initial candidate scFv. By comparing a library's predicted 
success to actual measurements, we demonstrate our method's ability to explore 
tradeoffs between library success and diversity. Results of our work highlight 
the significant impact machine learning models can have on scFv development. We 
expect our method to be broadly applicable and provide value to other protein 
engineering tasks.

Analysis of the Differentially Expressed Proteins and Metabolic Pathways of 
Honeybush (Cyclopia subternata) in Response to Water Deficit Stress.

Mahlare MS(1)(2), Husselmann L(3), Lewu MN(1), Bester C(1), Lewu FB(2), Caleb 
OJ(4)(5).

Honeybush (Cyclopia spp.) is a rich source of antioxidant properties and 
phenolic compounds. Water availability plays a crucial role in plant metabolic 
processes, and it contributes to overall quality. Thus, this study aimed to 
investigate changes in molecular functions, cellular components, and biological 
processes of Cyclopia subternata exposed to different water stress conditions, 
which include well-watered (as Control, T1), semi-water stressed (T2), and 
water-deprived (T3) potted plants. Samples were also collected from a 
well-watered commercial farm first cultivated in 2013 (T13) and then cultivated 
in 2017 (T17) and 2019 (T19). Differentially expressed proteins extracted from 
C. subternata leaves were identified using LC-MS/MS spectrometry. A total of 11 
differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified using Fisher's exact 
test (p < 0.00100). Only α-glucan phosphorylase was found to be statistically 
common between T17 and T19 (p < 0.00100). Notably, α-glucan phosphorylase was 
upregulated in the older vegetation (T17) and downregulated in T19 by 1.41-fold. 
This result suggests that α-glucan phosphorylase was needed in T17 to support 
the metabolic pathway. In T19, five DEPs were upregulated, while the other six 
were downregulated. Based on gene ontology, the DEPs in the stressed plant were 
associated with cellular and metabolic processes, response to stimulus, binding, 
catalytic activity, and cellular anatomical entity. Differentially expressed 
proteins were clustered based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
(KEGG), and sequences were linked to metabolic pathways via enzyme code and KEGG 
ortholog. Most proteins were involved in photosynthesis, phenylpropanoid 
biosynthesis, thiamine, and purine metabolism. This study revealed the presence 
of trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase, an intermediate for the biosynthesis of a 
large number of substances, such as phenylpropanoids and flavonoids.

INTERACTIONS BETWEEN BIOLOGICAL SEX AND THE X-LINKED VARIANT IRAK1 HAPLOTYPE IN 
MODULATING CLINICAL OUTCOME AND CELLULAR PHENOTYPES AFTER TRAUMA.

Qin Y(1), Livingston DH, Spolarics Z.

Sex-related outcome differences in trauma remain controversial. The mechanisms 
causing sex-biased outcomes are likely to have hormonal and genetic components, 
in which X-linked genetic polymorphisms may play distinct roles because of 
X-linked inheritance, hemizygosity in males, and X chromosome mosaicism in 
females. The study aimed to elucidate the contribution of biological sex and the 
common X-linked IRAK1 haplotype to posttrauma clinical complications, 
inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production, and polymorphonuclear cell and 
monocyte activation. Postinjury clinical outcome was tested in 1507 trauma 
patients (1,110 males, 397 females) after stratification by sex or the variant 
IRAK1 haplotype. Males showed a three- to fivefold greater frequency of 
posttrauma sepsis, but similar mortality compared to females. Stratification by 
the variant IRAK1 haplotype revealed increased pneumonia and urinary tract 
infection in Wild type (WT) versus variant IRAK1 males, whereas increased 
respiratory failures in variant versus WT females. Cytokine/chemokine profiles 
were tested in whole blood from a subset of patients (n = 81) and healthy 
controls (n = 51), which indicated sex-related differences in ex vivo 
lipopolysaccharide responsiveness manifesting in a 1.5- to 2-fold increased 
production rate of tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-10, 
Macrophage Inflammatory Protein-1 Alpha, and MIP1β in WT male compared to WT 
female trauma patients. Variant IRAK1 decreased IL-6, IL-8, and interferon 
gamma-induced protein 10 production in male trauma subjects compared to WT, 
whereas cytokine/chemokine responses were similar in variant IRAK1 and WT female 
trauma subjects. Trauma-induced and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated 
polymorphonuclear cell and monocyte activation determined by using a set of 
cluster of differentiation markers and flow cytometry were not influenced by sex 
or variant IRAK1. These findings suggest that variant IRAK1 is a potential 
contributor to sex-based outcome differences, but its immunomodulatory impacts 
are modulated by biological sex.

TMT-Based Comparative Proteomic Analysis of the Spermatozoa of Buck (Capra 
hircus) and Ram (Ovis aries).

Ren C(1), Chen Y(1), Tang J(1), Wang P(1), Zhang Y(2), Li C(2), Zhang Z(1)(3), 
Cheng X(1).

Spermatozoa are unique cells that carry a library of proteins that regulate the 
functions of molecules to achieve functional capabilities. Currently, large 
amounts of protein have been identified in spermatozoa from different species 
using proteomic approaches. However, the proteome characteristics and regulatory 
mechanisms of spermatozoa in bucks versus rams have not been fully unraveled. In 
this study, we performed a tandem mass tag (TMT)-labeled quantitative proteomic 
analysis to investigate the protein profiles in the spermatozoa of buck (Capra 
hircus) and ram (Ovis aries), two important economic livestock species with 
different fertility potentials. Overall, 2644 proteins were identified and 
quantified via this approach. Thus, 279 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) 
were filtered with a p-value < 0.05, and a quantitative ratio of >2.0 or <0.5 
(fold change, FC) in bucks versus rams, wherein 153 were upregulated and 126 
were downregulated. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that these DAPs were mainly 
localized in the mitochondria, extracellular and in the nucleus, and were 
involved in sperm motility, membrane components, oxidoreductase activity, 
endopeptidase complex and proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein 
catabolism. Specifically, partial DAPs, such as heat shock protein 90 α family 
class a member 1 (HSP90AA1), adenosine triphosphate citrate lyase (ACLY), 
proteasome 26S subunit and non-ATPase 4 (PSMD4), act as "cross-talk" nodes in 
protein-protein networks as key intermediates or enzymes, which are mainly 
involved in responses to stimuli, catalytic activity and molecular function 
regulator pathways that are strictly related to spermatozoa function. The 
results of our study offer valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of 
ram spermatozoa function, and also promote an efficient spermatozoa utilization 
link to fertility or specific biotechnologies for bucks and rams.

Extracellular matrix composition analysis of human articular cartilage for the 
development of organ-on-a-chip.

Upadhyay U(1), Kolla S(2), Chelluri LK(3).

INTRODUCTION: Articular cartilage has a complex extracellular matrix (ECM) that 
provides it a defined architecture for its load-bearing properties. The complete 
understanding of ECM components is imperative for developing biomimetic 
organ-on-a-chip tissue construct.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to decellularize and characterize the ECM for its 
protein profiling to generate a niche for enhanced chondrocyte proliferation.
METHODS: Articular cartilage scrapings were subjected to mechanical and 
collagenase digestion, followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) treatment for 
8 h and 16 h. The de-cellularization efficiency was confirmed by hematoxylin & 
eosin, alcian blue, masson's trichrome staining, and scanning electron 
microscopy (SEM). The ECM protein profile was quantified by liquid 
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using a bottom-up approach.
RESULTS: Histological characterization revealed void lacunae that lacked 
staining for cellular components. The ECM, sulfated glycosaminoglycan content, 
and collagen fibers were preserved after 8 h and 16 h of de-cellularization. The 
SEM ultrastructure images showed that few chondrocytes adhered to the ECM after 
8 h and cell-free ECM after 16 h of de-cellularization. LC-MS/MS analysis 
identified 66 proteins with heterotypic collagen types COL1A1-COL6A1, COL14A1, 
COL22A1 and COL25A1 showed moderate fold change and expression levels, while 
COL18A1, COL26A1, chondroitin sulfate, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9), 
fibronectin, platelet glycoprotein 1 beta alpha (GP1BA), vimentin, bone 
morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP6), fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4) and growth 
hormone receptor (GHR) showed maximum fold change and expression levels.
CONCLUSIONS: The standardized de-cellularization process could preserve majority 
of ECM components, providing structural integrity and architecture to the ECM. 
The Identified proteins quantified for their expression levels provided insight 
into engineering the ECM composition for developing cartilage-on-a-chip.

Improved protein production in yeast using cell engineering with genes related 
to a key factor in the unfolded protein response.

Lin Y(1), Feng Y(1), Zheng L(1), Zhao M(1), Huang M(2).

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a widely used cell factory for protein 
production. Increasing the protein production capacity of a yeast strain may be 
beneficial for obtaining recombinant proteins as a product or exerting its 
competence in consolidated bioprocessing. However, heterologous protein 
expression usually imposes stress on cells. Improving the cell's ability to cope 
with stress enhances protein yield. HAC1 is a key transcription factor in the 
unfolded protein response (UPR). In this study, several genes related to the UPR 
signal pathway, including unfolded protein sensing, HAC1 mRNA splicing, mRNA 
ligation, mRNA decay, translation, and Hac1p degradation, were selected as 
targets to engineer yeast strains. The final engineered strain produced 
α-amylase 3.3-fold, and human serum albumin 15.3-fold, greater than that of the 
control strain. Key regulation and metabolic network changes in the engineered 
strains were identified by transcriptome analysis and physiological 
characterizations. This study demonstrated that cell engineering with genes 
relevant to the key node HAC1 in UPR increased protein secretion substantially. 
The verified genetic modifications of this study provide useful targets in the 
construction of yeast cell factories for efficient protein production.

Functionalisation of extracellular vesicles with cyclic-RGDyC potentially for 
glioblastoma targeted intracellular drug delivery.

Geng T(1), Leung E(2), Chamley LW(3), Wu Z(4).

With the intrinsic ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, small extracellular 
vesicles (sEVs) hold promise as endogenous brain-targeted drug delivery 
nano-platforms for glioblastoma (GBM) treatment. To increase GBM targetability, 
this study aimed to functionalise sEVs with cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic 
acid-tyrosine-cysteine (cRGDyC), a ligand for integrin (αvβ3) that is 
overexpressed in GBM cells. Firstly, the intrinsic cellular uptake of sEVs 
derived from GBM U87 and pancreatic cancer MIA PaCa-2 cells was investigated on 
the donor cells. To obtain functionalised sEVs (cRGDyC-sEVs), 
DSPE-mPEG2000-maleimide was incubated with the selected (U87) sEVs, and cRGDyC 
was subsequently conjugated to the maleimide groups via a thiol-maleimide 
coupling reaction. The GBM cell targetability and intracellular trafficking of 
cRGDyC-sEVs were evaluated on U87 cells by fluorescence and confocal microscopy, 
using unmodified sEVs as a reference. The cytotoxicity of doxorubicin-loaded 
vesicles (Dox@sEVs, Dox@cRGDyC-sEVs) was compared with a standard liposome 
formulation (Dox@Liposomes) and free Dox. Both U87 and MIA PaCa-2 cell-derived 
sEVs displayed tropism with the former being >4.9-fold more efficient to be 
internalised into U87. Therefore, the U87-derived sEVs were chosen for 
GBM-targeting. Approximately 4000 DSPE-mPEG2000-maleimide were inserted onto 
each sEV with cRGDyC conjugated to the maleimide group. The cell targetability 
of cRGDyC-sEVs to U87 cells improved 2.4-fold than natural sEVs. Despite their 
proneness to be colocalised with endosomes/lysosomes, both Dox@sEVs and 
Dox@cRGDyC-sEVs showed superior cytotoxicity to U87 GBM cells compared to 
Dox@Liposomes, particularly Dox@cRGDyC-sEVs. Overall, U87-derived sEVs were 
successufully conjugated with cRGDyC via a PEG linker, and cRGDyC-sEVs were 
demonstrated to be a potnetial integrin-targeting drug delivery vehicle for GBM 
treatment. Graphic abstract.

Differential responses of COPD macrophages to respiratory bacterial pathogens.

Lea S(1), Beech A(1)(2), Baker J(1), Gaskell R(1), Pindolia D(1), Dikwa AB(1), 
Shah R(3), Singh D(1)(2).

COPD patients have increased susceptibility to airway bacterial colonisation. 
Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae are 
three of the most common respiratory bacterial species in COPD. H. influenzae 
colonisation, but not other bacteria, in COPD patients is associated with higher 
sputum neutrophil counts. Alveolar macrophages are key in clearance of bacteria 
as well as releasing mediators to recruit and activate other immune cells in 
response to infection. The aim was to characterise differences in COPD 
macrophage responses to H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis and S. pneumoniae, 
focusing on release of inflammatory and chemotactic mediators, and apoptosis 
regulation.  Lung macrophages and monocyte-derived macrophages from COPD 
patients and control subjects were exposed to H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis or 
S. pneumoniae. Cytokine secretion (tumour necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-6, 
CXCL8, CCL5 and IL-1β) were measured by ELISA and quantitative reverse 
transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR), and apoptosis genes MCL-1, BCL-2, BAX and BAK1 by 
RT-qPCR. Apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) release were also measured. 
 Macrophages responded differentially to the bacterial species, with increased, 
prolonged production of the neutrophil chemoattractant CXCL8 in response to H. 
influenzae and M. catarrhalis but not S. pneumoniae. S. pneumoniae initiated 
macrophage apoptosis and ROS release, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis did not 
and increased anti-apoptosis gene expression (BCL-2 5.5-fold and MCL-1 2.4-fold, 
respectively).  Differential cytokine responses of macrophages to these 
bacterial species can explain neutrophilic airway inflammation associated with 
H. influenzae, but not S. pneumoniae in COPD. Furthermore, delayed macrophage 
apoptosis is a potential mechanism contributing to inability to clear H. 
influenzae.

Zirconia-Toughened Alumina Ceramic Wear Particles Do Not Elicit Inflammatory 
Responses in Human Macrophages.

Deisinger U(1), Podlogar M(5), Trebše R(6)(7), Lovšin N(4).

Ten percent of patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA) require revision 
surgery. One of the reasons for THA are wear particles released from the 
implants that can activate the immune defense and cause osteolysis and failure 
of the joint implant. The discrepancies between reports on toxicity and 
immunogenicity of the implant materials led us to this study in which we 
compared toxicity and immunogenicity of well-defined nanoparticles from Al2O3, 
zirconia-toughened alumina (ZTA), and cobalt chrome (CoCr), a human THP-1 
macrophage cell line, human PBMCs, and therefrom-derived primary macrophages. 
None of the tested materials decreased the viability of THP-1 macrophages nor 
human primary macrophages at the 24 h time point, indicating that at 
concentrations from 0.05 to 50 µm3/cell the tested materials are non-toxic. 
Forty-eight hours of treatment of THP-1 macrophages with 5 µm3/cell of CoCr and 
Al2O3 caused 8.3-fold and 4.6-fold increases in TNF-α excretion, respectively, 
which was not observed for ZTA. The comparison between THP-1 macrophages and 
human primary macrophages revealed that THP-1 macrophages show higher activation 
of cytokine expression in the presence of CoCr and Al2O3 particles than primary 
macrophages. Our results indicate that ZTA is a non-toxic implant material with 
no immunogenic effects in vitro.

Hepatocytic AP-1 and STAT3 contribute to chemotaxis in 
alphanaphthylisothiocyanate-induced cholestatic liver injury.

X(4), Yang J(5), Liu A(6).

The development of cholestatic liver injury (CLI) involves inflammation, but the 
dominant pathway mediating the chemotaxis is not yet established. This work 
explored key signaling pathway mediating chemotaxis in CLI and the role of 
Kupffer cells in the inflammatory liver injury. Probe inhibitors T-5224 
(100 mg/kg) for AP-1 and C188-9 (100 mg/kg) for STAT3 were used to validate key 
inflammatory pathways in alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT, 100 mg/kg)-induced 
CLI. Two doses of GdCl3 (10 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg) were used to delete Kupffer 
cells and explore their role in CLI. Serum and liver samples were collected for 
biochemical and mechanism analysis. The liver injury in ANIT-treated mice were 
significantly increased supported by biochemical and histopathological changes, 
and neutrophils gathering around the necrotic loci. Inhibitor treatments 
down-regulated liver injury biomarkers except the level of total bile acid. The 
chemokine Ccl2 increased by 170-fold and to a less degree Cxcl2 by 45-fold after 
the ANIT treatment. p-c-Jun and p-STAT3 were activated in the group A but 
inhibited by the inhibitors in western blot analysis. The immunofluorescence 
results showed AP-1 not STAT3 responded to inhibitors in ANIT-induced CLI. With 
or without GdCl3, there was no significant difference in liver injury among the 
CLI groups. In necrotic loci in CLI, CXCL2 colocalized with hepatocyte biomarker 
Albumin, not with the F4/80 in Kupffer cells. Conclusively, AP-1 played a more 
critical role in the inflammation cascade than STAT3 in ANIT-induced CLI. 
Hepatocytes, not the Kupffer cells released chemotactic factors mediating the 
chemotaxis in CLI.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) due to their characteristic properties have a 
potential to treat osteoarthritis, one of the major growing joint problems. MSCs 
show differential ex vivo chondrogenic potential on the basis of source that 
remains to be validated under in vivo environment. This study compared 
chondrogenic potential of MSCs derived from two common sources, adipose tissue 
(AD) and bone marrow (BM) under ex vivo and in vivo environments. The randomized 
placebo controlled osteochondral defect (OCD) study divided n = 72 rabbits 
equally into Control, AD-MSCs and BM-MSCs groups. Ex vivo chondrogenic induction 
resulted in an increased aggrecan fold expression in BM-MSCs and AD-MSCs. The 
former cell type had significantly (p<0.05) higher fold expression as compared 
to the latter. The cell treated OCDs had significantly reduced gene expression 
for inflammatory markers (IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α) as compared to the control. In 
OCD study, radiography, MRI, gross observation, histopathology and SEM revealed 
that the cell treated defects were early filled by the tissue that had better 
surface architecture and matrices as compared to the control. BM-MSCs treated 
defects had better scores especially for gross and histopathology than the 
AD-MSCs. Gene expression for osteochondral regulation and cartilaginous matrices 
was higher in BM-MSCs group while only for matrices including the Col I in 
AD-MSCs as compared to the control. It was concluded that OCD in the cell 
treated groups are filled early with mostly a fibrocartilaginous to hyaline 
tissue. BM-MSCs may have an edge over AD-MSCs in OCD repair.

Light-Activated Reactive Oxygen Species-Responsive Nanocarriers for Enhanced 
Photodynamic Immunotherapy of Cancer.

Peng N(1), Du Y(1), Yu G(1), Zhang C(1), Cai Q(1), Tang H(2), Liu Y(1)(3).

Exploring polymeric nanoplatforms combined with reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
responsiveness with mitochondria targeting has emerged as an effective strategy 
for enhanced photodynamic therapy (PDT). Amphiphilic copolymers were synthesized 
by reacting acrylamide thioketal (TK) linkers with amino-terminated 
triphenylphosphonium-polyethylene glycol and dodecylamine for encapsulating 
chlorin e6 (Ce6) via self-assembly. Then, anionic cladding with tumor targeting 
deshelled in tumor acidic microenvironments was surface-anchored by 
electrostatic forces (BioPEGDMA@RM). After sequential targeting to the 
mitochondria of cancerous cells, BioPEGDMA@RM could be light-activated with Ce6 
released upon ROS cleavage of TK linkages. It was found that Ce6-loaded 
BioPEGDMA@RM exhibited higher cytotoxicity on CT26 cells and performed stronger 
ability on the production of ROS than that without TK linkers. Moreover, a 
minimum illumination of 3 and 5 min could be required for achieving the maximum 
release of Ce6 and high in vitro cytotoxicity for Ce6-loaded BioPEGDMA@RM, 
respectively. Furthermore, Ce6-loaded BioPEGDMA@RM showed 1.29-fold and 
1.21-fold higher tumor inhibition on BALB/c nude mice and Kunming mice and 
stimulated immunologic reactions with more generation of IFN-γ and TNF-α and 
activation of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T-lymphocytes and DCs than that of Ce6-loaded 
nanoparticles without TK bonds. This work provided an academic reference for the 
development of ROS-responsive drug delivery systems for advanced PDT efficiency.

Structure of the Repurposed Fungal Terpene Cyclase FlvF Implicated in the C-N 
Bond-Forming Reaction of Flavunoidine Biosynthesis.

Tararina MA(1), Yee DA(2), Tang Y(2)(3), Christianson DW(1).

The fungal species Aspergillus flavus produces an alkaloid terpenoid, 
flavunoidine, through a hybrid biosynthetic pathway combining both terpene 
cyclase and nonribosomal peptide synthetase enzymes. Flavunoidine consists of a 
tetracyclic, oxygenated sesquiterpene core decorated with dimethyl cadaverine 
and 5,5-dimethyl-l-pipecolate moieties. Unique to the flavunoidine biosynthetic 
pathway is FlvF, a putative enzyme implicated in stereospecific C-N bond 
formation as dimethyl cadaverine is linked to the sesquiterpene core to generate 
pre-flavunoidine. Here, we report the 2.6 Å resolution crystal structure of 
FlvF, which adopts the α-helical fold of a class I terpene synthase. However, 
FlvF is not a terpene synthase, as indicated by its lack of enzymatic activity 
with farnesyl diphosphate and its lack of signature metal ion binding motifs 
that would coordinate to catalytic Mg2+ ions. Thus, FlvF is the first example of 
a protein that adopts a terpene synthase fold but is not a terpene synthase. Two 
Bis-Tris molecules bind in the active site of FlvF, and the binding of these 
ligands guided the docking of pre-flavunoidine to generate a model of the 
enzyme-product complex. Phylogenetic analysis of FlvF and related fungal 
homologues reveals conservation of residues that interact with the tetracyclic 
sesquiterpene in this model, but less conservation of residues interacting with 
the pendant amino moiety. This may hint toward the possibility that alternative 
amino substrates can be linked to a common sesquiterpene core by FlvF homologues 
to generate flavunoidine congeners, such as the phospholipase C inhibitor 
hispidospermidin.

Placental vascular remodeling in pregnant women with COVID-19.

Gychka SG(1), Brelidze TI(2), Kuchyn IL(3), Savchuk TV(1), Nikolaienko SI(1), 
Zhezhera VM(4), Chermak II(5), Suzuki YJ(2).

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has been causing the pandemic of 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that has so far resulted in over 450 million 
infections and six million deaths. This respiratory virus uses 
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as a receptor to enter host cells and affects 
various tissues in addition to the lungs. The present study reports that the 
placental arteries of women who gave birth to live full-term newborns while 
developing COVID-19 during pregnancy exhibit severe vascular wall thickening and 
the occlusion of the vascular lumen. A morphometric analysis of the placental 
arteries stained with hematoxylin and eosin suggests a 2-fold increase in wall 
thickness and a 5-fold decrease in the lumen area. Placental vascular remodeling 
was found to occur in all of SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers as defined by RT-PCR. 
Immunohistochemistry with α-smooth muscle actin and the Kv11.1 channel as well 
as Masson's trichrome staining showed that such placental vascular remodeling in 
COVID-19 is associated with smooth muscle proliferation and fibrosis. Placental 
vascular remodeling may represent a response mechanism to the clinical problems 
associated with childbirth in COVID-19 patients.

Genetic polymorphism of HLA-DRA and alcohol consumption affect hepatitis 
development in the Korean population.

Hong M(1), Jung J(1), Jin HS(2), Hwang D(3).

BACKGROUND: Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver that has several potential 
causes; however, the genetic association has recently begun to be studied.
OBJECTIVES: Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) is an essential component of the 
immune response, and in this study, we conducted a correlation analysis to 
determine whether genetic polymorphisms of HLA and drinking habits affect 
hepatitis development.
METHODS: Genetic polymorphisms of HLA were investigated using Korean genomic and 
epidemiological data. A gene association study was performed using PLINK version 
1.07. Other statistical analyses and multivariate logistic regression analyses 
were performed using PASW Statistics version 18.0.
RESULTS: Thirteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HLA-DRA showed 
significant statistical correlations with hepatitis. In particular, rs9268645 
showed the highest statistical association with hepatitis (P = 3.97 × 10-5, odds 
ratio [OR] = 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.61-0.84). In multivariate 
logistic regression analysis, when considering only genetic factors, the A 
allele of rs9268644 showed a reduced hepatitis OR of approximately 0.52-fold. 
However, the group carrying the minor A allele (AA + AC) with alcohol 
consumption had an approximately 1.58-fold OR of hepatitis compared to that of 
the group carrying the same allele with no alcohol consumption. This implies 
that the A allele of rs9268644 has a protective effect on hepatitis by genetic 
factors and shows sensitivity to alcohol.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that hepatitis is influenced by both genetic and 
external factors (drinking habits), which can provide new guidelines for the 
prevention or treatment of hepatitis.

Immune Response Modulation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa Persister Cells.

Hastings CJ(1)(2), Himmler GE(1)(2), Patel A(1)(2), Marques CNH(1)(2).

Update of
    bioRxiv. 2023 Jan 08;:

Bacterial persister cells-a metabolically dormant subpopulation tolerant to 
antimicrobials-contribute to chronic infections and are thought to evade host 
immunity. In this work, we studied the ability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
persister cells to withstand host innate immunity. We found that persister cells 
resist MAC-mediated killing by the complement system despite being bound by 
complement protein C3b at levels similar to regular vegetative cells, in part 
due to reduced bound C5b, and are engulfed at a lower rate (10- to 100-fold), 
even following opsonization. Once engulfed, persister cells resist killing and, 
contrary to regular vegetative cells which induce a M1 favored 
(CD80+/CD86+/CD206-, high levels of CXCL-8, IL-6, and TNF-α) macrophage 
polarization, they initially induce a M2 favored macrophage polarization 
(CD80+/CD86+/CD206+, high levels of IL-10, and intermediate levels of CXCL-8, 
IL-6, and TNF-α), which is skewed toward M1 favored polarization (high levels of 
CXCL-8 and IL-6, lower levels of IL-10) by 24 h of infection, once persister 
cells awaken. Overall, our findings further establish the ability of persister 
cells to evade the innate host response and to contribute chronic infections. 
IMPORTANCE Bacterial cells have a subpopulation-persister cells-that have a low 
metabolism. Persister cells survive antimicrobial treatment and can regrow to 
cause chronic and recurrent infections. Currently little is known as to whether 
the human immune system recognizes and responds to the presence of persister 
cells. In this work, we studied the ability of persister cells from Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa to resist the host defense system (innate immunity). We found that 
this subpopulation is recognized by the defense system, but it is not killed. 
The lack of killing likely stems from hindering the immune response regulation, 
resulting in a failure to distinguish whether a pathogen is present. Findings 
from this work increase the overall knowledge as to how chronic infections are 
resilient.

An Integrated Analysis Reveals Ciliary Abnormalities in Antrochoanal Polyps.

Zi X(#)(1), Peng Y(#)(2), Zang Y(1), Chen S(2), Li M(3), Yu K(1), Liang X(1), 
Jin P(1), Wang D(4), Shi L(1).

OBJECTIVE: The mechanisms underlying the antrochoanal polyps (ACPs) remained 
unclear. We aimed to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) profile, 
the cilia-related genes expression levels and the morphological characteristics 
of ciliated cells in patients with ACPs.
METHODS: We obtained ACPs biopsy samples from 28 patients and uncinate process 
from 27 healthy controls. Whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing, immunofluorescence 
staining, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and scanning electron 
microscopy were performed.
RESULTS: 3739 DEGs were detected between ACPs and controls, and Gene Ontology 
analysis on these DEGs implicated cilium assembly, cilium motility, cilia 
component, cilia function, inflammatory response and immune system process were 
included in ACPs pathogenesis. Gene set enrichment analysis implicated sets of 
genes regulated in processes associated with cilium organization, cilium 
morphogenesis, cilium movement, axoneme assembly, axonemal dynein complex 
assembly and cell projection assembly. The expression levels of cilia-related 
genes (FOXJ1, DNAI1, DNAH9, RSPH1, RSPH9 and RSPH4A) were validated by 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Fold change >2, P<0.05) and FOXJ1 was 
positive correlated with DNAI1, DNAH9, RSPH4, RSPH1, RSPH9, DNAH5, DNALI1 in 
ACPs (all P < 0.05). Based on our semi-quantitative scoring system, median 
scores of α-Tubulin, DNAI1 and RSPH4A were significantly higher in ACPs than in 
controls. In addition, loss of ciliated cells and a shorter cilia pattern were 
further confirmed by immunofluorescence staining and scanning electron 
microscopy in ACPs.
CONCLUSION: The aberrant expression of cilia-related genes and ciliary 
structural impairment are an important pathological phenomenon in ACPs, and our 
findings may provide novel insights into understanding the mysterious mechanisms 
underlying ACPs.

Apoptosis-Inducing Effects of Short-Chain Fatty Acids-Rich Fermented Pistachio 
Milk in Human Colon Carcinoma Cells.

Lim SJ(1), Kwon HC(1), Shin DM(2), Choi YJ(3), Han SG(1), Kim YJ(1), Han SG(1).

Pistachio milk (PM), an extraction product of pistachio, is protein- and 
fat-dense food. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are known for inducing 
cytotoxicity and apoptosis in colon carcinoma cells. This study aimed to find an 
optimal combination of probiotics that can produce a higher amount of SCFAs in 
PM. In addition, the anti-cancer effect of fermented PM on human colon carcinoma 
cells (Caco-2) was determined. The combinations of probiotics were as follows: 
Streptococcus thermophilus + Lactobacillus bulgaricus (C); C + Lactobacillus 
acidophilus (C-La); C + Lactobacillus gasseri (C-Lg); C + Bifidobacterium 
bifidum (C-Bb). The results indicated that fermented PM was produced after a 
short fermentation time in all the probiotics combinations. C-Bb produced up to 
1.5-fold more acetate than the other probiotics combinations did. A significant 
amount of cytotoxicity, i.e., 78, 56, and 29% cell viability was observed in 
Caco-2 cells by C-Bb-fermented PM at 1, 2.5 and 5%, respectively. C-Bb-fermented 
PM (5%) induced early and late apoptosis up to 6-fold. Additionally, Caco-2 
cells treated with C-Bb-fermented PM significantly induced the downregulation of 
α-tubulin and the upregulation of cleaved caspase-3, as well as nuclear 
condensation and fragmentation. Our data suggest that fermented PM, which is 
rich in acetate, may have the potential as a functional food possessing 
anti-colon cancer properties.

Decreased Innate Migration of Pro-Inflammatory M1 Macrophages through the 
Mesothelial Membrane Is Affected by Ceramide Kinase and Ceramide 1-P.

Ku CW(1)(2), Yang J(2)(3), Tan HY(4), Chan JKY(1)(2)(4), Lee YH(2)(3).

The retrograde flow of endometrial tissues deposited into the peritoneal cavity 
occurs in women during menstruation. Classically (M1) or alternatively (M2) 
activated macrophages partake in the removal of regurgitated menstrual tissue. 
The failure of macrophage egress from the peritoneal cavity through the 
mesothelium leads to chronic inflammation in endometriosis. To study the 
migration differences of macrophage phenotypes across mesothelial cells, an in 
vitro model of macrophage egress across a peritoneal mesothelial cell monolayer 
membrane was developed. M1 macrophages were more sessile, emigrating 2.9-fold 
less than M2 macrophages. The M1 macrophages displayed a pro-inflammatory 
cytokine signature, including IL-1α, IL-1β, TNF-α, TNF-β, and IL-12p70. Mass 
spectrometry sphingolipidomics revealed decreased levels of ceramide-1-phosphate 
(C1P), an inducer of migration in M1 macrophages, which correlated with its poor 
migration behavior. C1P is generated by ceramide kinase (CERK) from ceramide, 
and blocking C1P synthesis via the action of NVP231, a specific CERK chemical 
inhibitor, prohibited the emigration of M1 and M2 macrophages up to 6.7-fold. 
Incubation with exogenously added C1P rescued this effect. These results suggest 
that M1 macrophages are less mobile and have higher retention in the peritoneum 
due to lower C1P levels, which contributes to an altered peritoneal environment 
in endometriosis by generating a predominant pro-inflammatory cytokine 
environment.

Gut microbiota composition in chemotherapy and targeted therapy of patients with 
metastatic colorectal cancer.

Chen YC(1)(2), Chuang CH(3), Miao ZF(1), Yip KL(1), Liu CJ(4), Li LH(5), Wu 
DC(6)(7), Cheng TL(6), Lin CY(3), Wang JY(1)(2)(8)(9)(10)(11).

Studies have reported the effects of the gut microbiota on colorectal cancer 
(CRC) chemotherapy, but few studies have investigated the association between 
gut microbiota and targeted therapy. This study investigated the role of the gut 
microbiota in the treatment outcomes of patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC). We 
enrolled 110 patients with mCRC and treated them with standard cancer therapy. 
Stool samples were collected before administering a combination of chemotherapy 
and targeted therapy. Patients who had a progressive disease (PD) or partial 
response (PR) for at least 12 cycles of therapy were included in the study. We 
further divided these patients into anti-epidermal growth factor receptor 
(cetuximab) and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (bevacizumab) subgroups. 
The gut microbiota of the PR group and bevacizumab-PR subgroup exhibited 
significantly higher α-diversity. The β-diversity of bacterial species 
significantly differed between the bevacizumab-PR and bevacizumab-PD groups 
(P = 0.029). Klebsiella quasipneumoniae exhibited the greatest fold change in 
abundance in the PD group than in the PR group. Lactobacillus and 
Bifidobacterium species exhibited higher abundance in the PD group. The 
abundance of Fusobacterium nucleatum was approximately 32 times higher in the PD 
group than in the PR group. A higher gut microbiota diversity was associated 
with more favorable treatment outcomes in the patients with mCRC. Bacterial 
species analysis of stool samples yielded heterogenous results. K. 
quasipneumoniae exhibited the greatest fold change in abundance among all 
bacterial species in the PD group. This result warrants further investigation 
especially in a Taiwanese population.

A prospective cohort study was conducted for adults with a diagnosis of with 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Convalescent blood samples were obtained 4, 
6, and 11 months after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) infection. The seropositivity of anti-spike antibody was maintained 
in all patients (100%) until 11 months after COVID-19 diagnosis. Neutralizing 
antibody levels against wild-type SARS-CoV-2 gradually decreased but remained 
positive in >50% of patients 11 months after diagnosis: in 98.5% (67 of 68) at 4 
months, 86.8% (46 of 53) at 6 months, and 58.8% (40 of 68) at 11 months. 
However, cross-neutralizing activity against the Beta and Delta variants was 
attenuated 2.53-fold and 2.93-fold, respectively, compared with the wild-type 
strain.

Digital versus conventional veneering of zirconia and cobalt chromium crowns: 
Fracture load before and after thermomechanical aging.

Mayinger F(1), Meinen J(2), Coldea A(3), Zimmermann M(4), Stawarczyk B(5).

STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: To complement the digital workflow for manufacturing fixed 
dental prostheses, both high-strength frameworks and esthetic veneers should be 
designed and fabricated digitally. However, how the fracture load of digitally 
veneered restorations compares with conventionally fabricated restorations is 
unclear.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to examine the fracture load of 
digitally and conventionally veneered zirconia and cobalt chromium crowns 
initially and after thermomechanical aging.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Milled zirconia and cobalt chromium copings for a 
maxillary canine were fabricated (N=96). Digital veneers were milled and 
connected to the copings with a sintered ceramic slurry. The conventional 
veneers were fabricated by using a master mold, and the crowns were bonded to 
the cobalt chromium abutments. Half the specimens were subjected to 6000 thermal 
(5 °C to 55 °C, 60 seconds) and 1 200 000 mechanical (50 N, 1.5 Hz, 0.7 mm 
lateral movement) cycles opposed by steatite antagonists, and the fracture load 
was determined. Fracture types were categorized, and scanning electron 
microscopy performed. The data were analyzed with a 3-way global univariate 
analysis of variance, t test, the Pearson chi-squared test, and the Weibull 
modulus (α=.05).
RESULTS: Unlike the framework material (P=.316) and artificial aging (P=.064), 
the veneering protocol affected the fracture load (P=.007). Digital veneers 
(range: 2242 to 2929 N) led to lower values than conventional veneers (range: 
2825 to 3166 N), which was significant for aged cobalt chromium copings (P=.024; 
2242 versus 3107 N). Conventionally veneered crowns showed lower Weibull moduli 
after thermomechanical aging (range: 3.2 to 3.5) than initially (range: 7.8 to 
11.4). The copings of all the zirconia specimens fractured, while chipping 
occurred with the cobalt chromium specimens.
CONCLUSIONS: The high fracture load values of the veneered crowns, even after 
simulated 5-year aging, indicated sufficient mechanical properties (nearly 
4-fold the average occlusal force of 600 N) for the successful clinical 
application of digitally veneered zirconia and cobalt chromium copings.

Flavone inhibits Staphylococcus aureus virulence via inhibiting the sae two 
component system.

Tao Z(1), Wang H(2), Ke K(3), Shi D(4), Zhu L(5).

The rising prevalence of antibiotic resistance in Staphylococcus aureus calls 
for the development of innovative antimicrobial agents targeting novel pathways. 
S. aureus generates various virulence factors that compromise host defense 
mechanisms. Flavone, a core structure of flavonoids, has been shown to diminish 
the production of staphyloxanthin and alpha-hemolysin. Nonetheless, the 
influence of flavone on the majority of other virulence factors in S. aureus and 
its underlying molecular mechanism remain elusive. In this study, we examined 
the impact of flavone on the transcriptional profile of S. aureus using 
transcriptome sequencing. Our findings revealed that flavone substantially 
downregulated the expression of over 30 virulence factors implicated in immune 
evasion by the pathogen. Gene set enrichment analysis of the fold change-ranked 
gene list in relation to the Sae regulon indicated a robust association between 
flavone-induced downregulation and membership in the Sae regulon. Through the 
analysis of Sae target promoter-gfp fusion expression patterns, we observed a 
dose-dependent inhibition of Sae target promoter activity by flavone. Moreover, 
we discovered that flavone protected human neutrophils from S. aureus-mediated 
killing. Flavone also decreased the expression of alpha-hemolysin and other 
hemolytic toxins, resulting in a reduction in S. aureus' hemolytic capacity. 
Additionally, our data suggested that the inhibitory effect of flavone on the 
Sae system operates independently of its capacity to lower staphyloxanthin 
levels. In conclusion, our study proposes that flavone exhibits a broad 
inhibitory action on multiple virulence factors of S. aureus by targeting the 
Sae system, consequently diminishing the bacterium's pathogenicity.

C-6 fluorinated casuarines as highly potent and selective amyloglucosidase 
inhibitors: Synthesis and structure-activity relationship study.

Li YX(1), Wang JZ(1), Shimadate Y(2), Kise M(2), Kato A(3), Jia YM(1), Fleet 
GWJ(4), Yu CY(5).

A series of C-6 fluorinated casuarine derivatives have been synthesized via 
organocatalytic stereoselective α-fluorination of iminosugar-based aldehydes or 
direct nucleophilic fluorination of polyhydroxylated pyrrolizidines. Glycosidase 
assays against various glycosidases allowed systematic structure-activity 
relationship (SAR) study using molecular docking calculations. Introduction of 
fluorine atom(s) at C-6 position removed the trehalase and maltase inhibitory 
activities of all casuarine derivatives, and greatly increased their specificity 
towards amyloglucosidase. Inhibition of the fluorinated casuarines depended on 
the configuration of C-6 fluorine, of which 6-deoxy-6-epi-6-fluoro-casuarine 
(24) was found approximately 40-fold potent than its parent compound 
6-epi-casuarine (2) as a potent and specific inhibitor of amyloglucosidase. 
Molecular docking calculations showed that replacement of the C-6 hydroxyls by 
fluorine atom(s) removed the original interactions with trehalase, but helped to 
reinforce the binding with amyloglucosidase via newly established fluorine 
related hydrogen bonding or untypical anion-π interactions. To further 
investigate the quantitative SARs of casuarine derivatives, the CoMFA and CoMSIA 
models on amyloglucosidase were established, indicating the dominating effect of 
electrostatic field in amyloglucosidase inhibition. The 3D-QSAR models were 
validated to be reliable and can be used for further optimization of 
casuarine-related iminosugars, as well as design and development of 
anti-diabetic and immunomodulatory drugs.

An acoustofluidic scanning nanoscope using enhanced image stacking and 
processing.

Jin G(1), Rich J(2), Xia J(1), He AJ(1), Zhao C(3)(4), Huang TJ(1).

Nanoscale optical resolution with a large field of view is a critical feature 
for many research and industry areas, such as semiconductor fabrication, 
biomedical imaging, and nanoscale material identification. Several scanning 
microscopes have been developed to resolve the inverse relationship between the 
resolution and field of view; however, those scanning microscopes still rely 
upon fluorescence labeling and complex optical systems. To overcome these 
limitations, we developed a dual-camera acoustofluidic nanoscope with a seamless 
image merging algorithm (alpha-blending process). This design allows us to 
precisely image both the sample and the microspheres simultaneously and 
accurately track the particle path and location. Therefore, the number of images 
required to capture the entire field of view (200 × 200 μm) by using our 
acoustofluidic scanning nanoscope is reduced by 55-fold compared with previous 
designs. Moreover, the image quality is also greatly improved by applying an 
alpha-blending imaging technique, which is critical for accurately depicting and 
identifying nanoscale objects or processes. This dual-camera acoustofluidic 
nanoscope paves the way for enhanced nanoimaging with high resolution and a 
large field of view.

Quantitative Proteomic and Phosphoproteomic Profiling of Lung Tissues from 
Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Rat Model.

Luo A(1), Jia Y(1), Hao R(1), Yu Y(1), Zhou X(1), Gu C(1), Ren M(2), Tang H(1).

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare but fatal disease characterized 
by elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and increased pressure in the distal 
pulmonary arteries. Systematic analysis of the proteins and pathways involved in 
the progression of PAH is crucial for understanding the underlying molecular 
mechanism. In this study, we performed tandem mass tags (TMT)-based relative 
quantitative proteomic profiling of lung tissues from rats treated with 
monocrotaline (MCT) for 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks. A total of 6759 proteins were 
quantified, among which 2660 proteins exhibited significant changes (p-value < 
0.05, fold change < 0.83 or >1.2). Notably, these changes included several known 
PAH-related proteins, such as Retnla (resistin-like alpha) and arginase-1. 
Furthermore, the expression of potential PAH-related proteins, including Aurora 
kinase B and Cyclin-A2, was verified via Western blot analysis. In addition, we 
performed quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis on the lungs from MCT-induced 
PAH rats and identified 1412 upregulated phosphopeptides and 390 downregulated 
phosphopeptides. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed significant involvement of 
pathways such as complement and coagulation cascades and the signaling pathway 
of vascular smooth muscle contraction. Overall, this comprehensive analysis of 
proteins and phosphoproteins involved in the development and progression of PAH 
in lung tissues provides valuable insights for the development of potential 
diagnostic and treatment targets for PAH.

Nationwide assessment of atmospheric organochlorine pesticides over a decade 
during 2008-2017 in South Korea.

Khuman SN(1), Park MK(2), Kim HJ(3), Hwang SM(4), Lee CH(5), Choi SD(6).

Long-term nationwide atmospheric monitoring of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) 
was performed in South Korea during 2008-2017. Their occurrences, seasonal and 
temporal variability, sources, and effect of ambient temperature were 
investigated. The OCPs are pronounced with a mean concentration of total OCPs 
ranging from 5.2 to 256 pg/Sm3. However, a decrease of 54 % was observed in the 
mean concentration of total OCPs from 2008 to 2017 associated with regulatory 
actions. OCP concentrations did not show any variations between the different 
site types, and OCPs were ubiquitously present at all site types. The mean 
concentration of total OCPs in summer was two-fold higher than in winter. The 
concentrations of DRINs, DDTs, ENDOs, and HCHs were significantly higher in 
summer, but the concentrations of chlordane and heptachlor were higher in 
winter. The diagnostic ratios identified major sources as ongoing sources, past 
use, and atmospheric transport. Clausius Clapeyron plots strongly suggested the 
re-emission of α-endosulfan, β-endosulfan, α-HCH, and β-HCH, and ΔHsa (enthalpy 
of surface air exchange) values suggested the influence of the transport and/or 
new sources on aldrin, dieldrin, and chlordane. The occurrence of OCPs due to 
re-emissions, ongoing sources, and long-range atmospheric transport could be a 
challenge towards the complete phase-out of OCPs in South Korea.

Discovery of structural and functional transition sites for membrane-penetrating 
activity of sheep myeloid antimicrobial peptide-18.

Jung B(1), Yun H(1), Min HJ(2), Yang S(3), Shin SY(4), Lee CW(5).

Cathelicidin antimicrobial peptides have an extended and/or unstructured 
conformation in aqueous solutions but fold into ordered conformations, such as 
the α-helical structure, when interacting with cellular membranes. These 
structural transitions can be directly correlated to their antimicrobial 
activity and its underlying mechanisms. SMAP-18, the N-terminal segment 
(residues 1-18) of sheep cathelicidin (SMAP-29), is known to kill microorganisms 
by translocating across membranes and interacting with their nucleic acids. The 
amino acid sequence of SMAP-18 contains three Gly residues (at positions 2, 7, 
and 13) that significantly affect the flexibility of its peptide structure. This 
study investigated the role of Gly residues in the structure, membrane 
interaction, membrane translocation, and antimicrobial mechanisms of SMAP-18. 
Five analogs were designed and synthesized through Gly → Ala substitution (i.e., 
G2A, G7A, G13A, G7,13A, and G2,7,13A); these substitutions altered the helical 
content of SMAP-18 peptides. We found that G7,13A and G2,7,13A changed their 
mode of action, with circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance studies 
revealing that these analogs changed the structure of SMAP-18 from a random coil 
to an α-helical structure. The results of this experiment suggest that the Gly 
residues at positions 7 and 13 in SMAP-18 are the structural and functional 
determinants that control its three-dimensional structure, strain-specific 
activity, and antimicrobial mechanism of action. These results provide valuable 
information for the design of novel peptide-based antibiotics.

Effect of fecal microbiota transplantation on the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway 
in rats with TNBS-induced colitis.

Qiu J(1), Wu C(2), Gao Q(1), Li S(3), Li Y(1).

BACKGROUND: Traditional treatments for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have 
adverse side effects, and patients who receive such treatments have high 
recurrence rates. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has become an 
increasingly popular therapeutic option for patients with IBD. However, the 
mechanism by which FMT alleviates this disease remains unclear.
METHODS: In this study, a rat model of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid 
(TNBS)-induced colitis was established and used to explore whether the 
transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1)/small mothers against decapentaplegic 
(Smad) signaling pathway plays a critical role in the FMT alleviation of IBD.
RESULTS: After the FMT intervention, the disease activity index and histologic 
scores were significantly decreased. In addition, the TGF-β1 expression level in 
the FMT group was significantly decreased by approximately 0.72-fold relative to 
the level in the TNBS colitis group, whereas the Smad3, Smad4, and Smad7 
expression levels had increased by approximately 1.21, 1.40, and 1.18 folds, 
respectively. Similarly, SB431542 inhibited the expression of TGF-β1 and 
promoted the expression of Smad3, Smad4, and Smad7. Further, the serum levels of 
the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1β 
(IL-1β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were significantly decreased, whereas that of 
the interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) was not significantly changed after the FMT 
intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that FMT inhibits the TGF-β1/Smad signaling 
pathway to attenuate inflammation.

Determination of hormones in urine by hollow fiber microporous membrane 
liquid-liquid extraction associated with 96-well plate system and HPLC-FLD 
detection.

Lopes D(1), Morés L(1), da Silva M(1), Schneider M(1), Merib J(2), Carasek E(3).

In this work, hollow-fiber microporous membrane liquid-liquid extraction 
(HF-MMLLE) was associated with a 96-well plate system for the determination of 
estrone, 17-β-estradiol, estriol and 17-α-ethinylestradiol in urine samples. 
This method exhibited some advantages, such as low cost, easy application, 
high-throughput and environmentally-friendly aspects. The type of organic 
solvent to fill the membrane, ionic strength effect, sample dilution, extraction 
and desorption time, and desorption solvent were examined. After the 
optimizations, the conditions were comprised of 45 min of extraction, 1-octanol 
as organic solvent and 15% (w/v) of NaCl; methanol was used as desorption 
solvent, and the desorption time was fixed at 10 min. The dilution of the sample 
increased the sensitivity due to the reduction of matrix effects; thus, urine 
samples were diluted 40-fold. The limits of detection ranged from 0.03 μg L-1 
for 17-β-estradiol to 15 μg L-1 for estrone, and the limits of quantification 
ranged from 0.1 μg L-1 for 17-β-estradiol to 10 μg L-1 for estrone. The 
intra-day precision varied from 1.0% for estriol to 13.3% for 
17-α-ethinylestradiol, and inter-day precision varied from 7.3% for estrone to 
18.1% for estriol. The relative recoveries varied from 82 to 118%.

Poly-ɛ-caprolactone nanocapsules loaded with copaiba essential oil reduce 
inflammation and pain in mice.

Diverse drugs have been used for the management of inflammation disorders and 
pain. However, they present many side effects and stimulate the search for new 
pharmacotherapeutic alternatives. Plant-derived products such as copaiba 
essential oil (CO) offer beneficial pharmacological effects. On the other hand, 
essential oil's low water solubility and physical instability hinder itsin 
vivoapplication. Thus, poly-ɛ-caprolactone (PCL)-based nanocarriers have been 
used to increase their stability and efficacy. This work aimed to encapsulate CO 
in PCL nanocapsules and evaluate their effect on inflammation models and pain. 
The polymeric nanocapsules loading CO (CO-NC) were prepared by nanoprecipitation 
technique, characterized, and analyzed for their anti-inflammatory effectin 
vitroandin vivo. The results showed that CO-NC presented a spherical shape, 
229.3 ± 1.5 nm diameter, and a negative zeta potential (approximately -23 mV). 
CO and CO-NC presented anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects by 
LPS-activated macrophages (J774 cells). In addition, CO-NC significantly reduced 
TNF-α secretion (3-fold) compared to CO.In vivo, pre-treatment with CO or CO-NC 
(50, 100, 200 mg/kg, intraperitoneal; i.p) reduced the mechanical allodynia, paw 
edema, and pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by intraplantar (i.pl) injection 
of carrageenan in mice. Specifically, CO-NC (200 mg/kg; i.p.) reduced the 
production of TNF-α similar to the control group. Our results support using 
polymeric nanocapsules for CO delivery in inflammatory conditions.

Mannose 6-phosphate receptor-targeting antibodies preserve Fc receptor-mediated 
recycling.

Gauthier C(1), Mariot J(2), Daurat M(3), Dhommée C(2), El Cheikh K(3), Morère 
E(1), Depaepe G(1), Gary-Bobo M(4), Morère A(4), Garcia M(3), Basile I(3), 
Gouilleux-Gruart V(5), Maynadier M(6).

The concept of grafting mannose 6-phosphonate derivatives (M6Pn), named AMFA, on 
therapeutic proteins was first developed for the improvement of enzyme delivery 
in lysosomal storage disorders. This glycoengineering increases the cellular 
uptake of the protein via the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor 
(M6PR) which further allows their targeting to the lysosomes. In the present 
study, we investigated the extent to which the direct grafting of AMFA onto a 
drug, here a monoclonal antibody (mAb), affects the cell uptake and recycling of 
the antibody. The antibodies infliximab (IFX) and adalimumab (ADA), directed 
against the tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), grafted with AMFA acquired an 
affinity for the M6PR, resulting in a >3-fold increase in drug release in cells. 
Subsequently, the impact of AMFA grafting to the Fc portion of mAb on its 
affinity for the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), which is the key receptor for 
antibody recycling, was evaluated. Whether one to three AMFA moieties were 
grafted, FcRn-mediated recycling of mAb was not affected. AMFA grafting did not 
impair the pharmacokinetics of both ADA and IFX and presented a high stability 
since AMFA were still bound to mAb in the plasma of mice 21 days after the 
treatment. In conclusion, this type of antibody engineering with a reduced 
number of AMFA confers M6PR targeting property and increases endocytosis, and 
yet appears fully compatible with FcRn binding and with antibody recycling and 
transcytosis.

Differential protein expression of GABA A receptor alpha 1 subunit and calbindin 
in rat spermatozoa associated with proteomic analysis in testis following 
methamphetamine administration.

Kaewman P(1)(2), Nudmamud-Thanoi S(2)(3), Thongleart J(2), Charoenlappanit S(4), 
Roytrakul S(4), Thanoi S(5).

Methamphetamine (METH) can induce spermatogenesis impairment, testicular 
apoptosis, and abnormal sperm quality. It also promotes changes in the 
expression of receptors for sex hormones and neurotransmitters, including GABA 
receptors in the testis. Proteomic assessment focusing on proteins involved in 
the calcium signalling pathway in the testis can facilitate diagnostic factors 
contributing to testicular and sperm functions, especially those related to 
spermatogenesis and fertilisation. In this study, we proposed to determine the 
localisation and differential expression of GABA A receptor alpha 1 subunit 
(GABA A-α1) in the spermatozoa of METH-administered rats. The differential 
proteomic profile of the testis was also observed by focusing on proteins in the 
KEGG pathways belonging to the calcium signalling pathway. There were 212 
differentially expressed proteins in the rat testis, based on the cut-off value 
of 1.2-fold change. Most of those proteins, 13 proteins, were classified in the 
calcium signalling pathway, including 4 down-regulated and 9 up-regulated 
proteins. An immunolocalisation study of the GABA A-α1 receptor and calbindin 
revealed their localisation in the equatorial segment of the head in the rat 
spermatozoa. The expression of calbindin is also found in the middle piece of 
sperm. An increase in GABA A-α1 receptor in rat spermatozoa was correlated with 
an increase in abnormal sperm motility and morphology after methamphetamine 
exposure. Moreover, calbindin expression in sperm decreased in METH-administered 
rats. All our findings demonstrate that METH influences intracellular calcium 
homeostasis by acting through the calcium signalling pathway-associated 
proteins. Moreover, it might disrupt ion homeostasis in sperm through the GABA 
A-α1 receptor and calbindin, triggering a change in intracellular calcium and 
chloride ions. These changes may cause abnormalities in spermatogenesis, 
testicular apoptosis, and sperm quality impairment.

Critical structural elements for the antigenicity of wheat allergen LTP1 (Tri a 
14) revealed by site-directed mutagenesis.

F(11), Gohon Y(12), Briozzo P(12), Denery-Papini S(13).

Lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) were identified as allergens in a large variety 
of pollens and foods, including cereals. LTPs belong to the prolamin superfamily 
and display an α-helical fold, with a bundle of four α-helices held together by 
four disulfide bonds. Wheat LTP1 is involved in allergic reactions to food. To 
identify critical structural elements of antibody binding to wheat LTP1, we used 
site-directed mutagenesis on wheat recombinant LTP1 to target: (i) sequence 
conservation and/or structure flexibility or (ii) each disulfide bond. We 
evaluated the modifications induced by these mutations on LTP1 secondary 
structure by synchrotron radiation circular dichroism and on its antigenicity 
with patient's sera and with mouse monoclonal antibodies. Disruption of the 
C28-C73 disulfide bond significantly affected IgE-binding and caused protein 
denaturation, while removing C13-C27 bond decreased LTP1 antigenicity and 
slightly modified LTP1 overall folding. In addition, we showed Lys72 to be a key 
residue; the K72A mutation did not affect global folding but modified the local 
3D structure of LTP1 and strongly reduced IgE-binding. This work revealed a 
cluster of residues (C13, C27, C28, C73 and K72), four of which embedded in 
disulfide bonds, which play a critical role in LTP1 antigenicity.

Poly(pseudo)rotaxanes formed by mixed micelles and α-cyclodextrin enhance 
terbinafine nail permeation to deeper layers.

Krawczyk-Santos AP(1), Marreto RN(1), Concheiro A(2), Alvarez-Lorenzo C(2), 
Taveira SF(1).

This work aimed to develop water-based formulations for onychomycosis topical 
treatment using micelles of small pegylated surfactants associated with 
α-cyclodextrin (αCD) to deliver terbinafine to the nail. Kolliphor® RH40 (RH40) 
and Gelucire® 48/16 (GEL) single and mixed micelles (RH40:GEL 1:1) were 
prepared. αCD was added to the surfactants dispersions to form 
poly(pseudo)rotaxanes (PPR). Formulations were characterized in terms of drug 
solubilization (3 to 34-fold increase), particle size (9-11 nm) and Z-potential 
(+0.3 - +1.96 mV), blood compatibility (non-hemolytic), rheological behavior 
(solid-like viscoelastic properties after 5-10% αCD addition), drug release and 
interaction with the nail plate. GEL micelles and surfactant-10% αCD PPRs 
notably hydrated the nail plate. The high viscosity of PPR led to a slower drug 
release, except for RH40:GEL +10% αCD that surprisingly released terbinafine 
faster. The RH40:GEL +10% αCD formulation delivered twice more amount of 
terbinafine to deeper regions of nail plate compared to other formulations. The 
results evidenced the potential of PPR formed by small pegylated surfactants as 
a water-based formulation for nail drug delivery.

Identification and characterization of ι-carrageenase from macroalgae-associated 
bacterium Microbulbifer sp. YNDZ01.

Zhang Q(1), Gui Y(1), Zhao L(1), Zhang A(2), Fu L(1), Cao Z(1), Li J(1).

BACKGROUND: In the present study, the ι-carrageenase gene, Car1293, was obtained 
from the genome of Microbulbifer sp. YNDZ01, which was isolated from the surface 
of macroalgae. To date, there are few studies on ι-carrageenase and the 
anti-inflammatory activity of ι-carrageenan oligosaccharides (CGOS). To enhance 
our perspective on ι-carrageenase and ι-carrageen oligosaccharides, the 
sequence, protein structure, enzymatic properties, enzymatic digestion products 
and anti-inflammatory activity of the gene were investigated.
RESULTS: The gene length of Car1293 is 2,589 bp, encoding an enzyme with 862 
amino acids, which shares 34% similarity with any previously reported 
ι-carrageenase. The spatial structure of Car1293 consists of many α-helices with 
a β-fold binding module located at its terminus, and eight binding sites were 
found in the binding module as a result of docking with CGOS-DP4 ligand. The 
optimum temperature and pH for the activity of recombinant Car1293 toward 
ι-carrageenan were 50 °C and 6.0, respectively. The hydrolysates of Car1293 are 
mainly degree of polymerization (DP)8, with minor products showing DP2, DP4, and 
DP6. The enzymatic hydrolysates CGOS-DP8 showed prominent anti-inflammatory 
activity, which was greater than that of the positive control 
l-monomethylarginine in lipopolysaccharide-induced RAW264.7 macrophages. It 
inhibited nitric oxide production, as well as significantly inhibited tumor 
necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 secretion.
CONCLUSION: The ι-carrageenase sequence encoded by Car1293 is novel and can 
hydrolyze carrageenan into CGOS-DP8 that has a significant anti-inflammatory 
effect. The present study fills a gap in the research on the biological activity 
of oligosaccharides in ι-carrageenan and provides promising data for the 
development of natural anti-inflammatory agent. © 2023 Society of Chemical

Dihydrotestosterone, and Not Testosterone, Enhances the LPS-Induced Inflammatory 
Cytokine Gene Expression in Human Adipocytes.

Di Vincenzo A(1), Granzotto M(1), Crescenzi M(1), Vindigni V(2), Vettor R(1), 
Rossato M(1).

BACKGROUND: The development of obesity-related complications lies in the 
low-grade inflammatory state consequent to adipocyte dysfunction. The direct 
involvement of sex hormones in adipose tissue inflammation has been previously 
suggested, but the evidence is scarce. In this study, we evaluated the effects 
of sex steroids on the in-vitroexpression of inflammatory mediators in 
human-derived adipocytes before and after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure.
METHODS: Human adipocytes were differentiated from the vascular stromal fraction 
of adipose tissue samples of subjects undergoing abdominoplasty. We evaluated 
MCP-1, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α gene expression in the presence of the main sex 
steroids, testosterone (T), and 17β-estradiol (E). Furthermore, we analyzed the 
effects of adipocytes exposure to the non-aromatizable androgen 
dihydrotestosterone (DHT), together with the effects of adipocytes 
pre-incubation with the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole alone (A), and in 
combination with T (A/T) before incubation with LPS.
RESULTS: DHT, but not T, significantly enhanced the LPSinduction of MCP-1, 
IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. Intriguingly, the exposure of adipocytes with A/T 
dramatically increased the LPS-induced expression of all considered inflammatory 
cytokines, even more than a hundred-fold.
CONCLUSIONS: DHT and A/T dramatically enhance LPS-induced inflammatory cytokine 
expression in human-derived adipocytes. These results confirm the involvement of 
sex hormones in adipose tissue inflammation, suggesting a specific role for 
non-aromatizable androgens as the amplificatory sex hormones of the inflammatory 
response.

Solid-state characterization of ibuprofen-isonicotinamide cocrystals prepared by 
electrospraying and solvent evaporation.

Ghafari R(1), Jahangiri A(1), Shayanfar A(2)(3), Emami S(1).

Aim: Electrospraying (ELS) was used to prepare micronized 
ibuprofen-isonicotinamide cocrystal (IBU-INA-ELS) and its properties were 
compared with the solvent evaporated cocrystal (IBU-INA-SE). Methods: 
Solid-state characterization of crystalline phase, production yield, particle 
size, powder flow, wettability, solution mediated phase transformation (SMPT), 
and dissolution rate were measured. Results: The ELS produced phase pure 
particles of IBU-INA with a size of 1.46 μm and yield of 72.3%. This cocrystal 
improved the intrinsic dissolution rate and powder dissolution rate of IBU by 
3.6- and 1.7-fold, respectively. Our experiments showed that the dissolution of 
IBU-INA was affected by particle size, solubility, SMPT and wettability. 
Conclusion: ELS produced micronized cocrystals for improving dissolution of 
ibuprofen with a high yield in a single step and mild conditions.

Plain Language Summary: The intestinal absorption of ibuprofen is limited by low 
dissolution rate in the gastrointestinal fluids. This drug needs applied in an 
appropriate method to enhance its dissolution. One way to improve dissolution of 
ibuprofen is preparing micronized cocrystal of this drug and a water soluble 
compound, isonicotinamide. In this study, we prepared and characterized 
micronized particles of ibuprofen-isonicotinamide cocrystal by electrospraying, 
a single step and continuous method without need for any added material. Our 
experiments showed that the prepared micronized cocrystal could improve the 
dissolution of ibuprofen but the cocrystal is rapidly precipitated as ibuprofen 
crystals in contact with dissolution medium. This precipitation hampered the 
expected increase in dissolution. Therefore, solution mediated phase 
transformation should be considered in formulating micronized cocrystals.

Design of a chimeric ACE-2/Fc-silent fusion protein with ultrahigh affinity and 
neutralizing capacity for SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Bodie NM(1), Hashimoto R(2), Connolly D(3), Chu J(4), Takayama K(2), Uhal BD(5).

BACKGROUND: As SARS-CoV-2 continues to mutate into Variants of Concern (VOC), 
there is growing and urgent need to develop effective antivirals to combat 
COVID-19. Monoclonal antibodies developed earlier are no longer capable of 
effectively neutralizing currently active VOCs. This report describes the design 
of variant-agnostic chimeric molecules consisting of an Angiotensin-Converting 
Enzyme 2 (ACE-2) domain mutated to retain ultrahigh affinity binding to a wide 
variety of SARS-CoV-2 variants, coupled to an Fc-silent immunoglobulin domain 
that eliminates antibody-dependent enhancement and extends biological half-life.
METHODS: Molecular modeling, Surrogate Viral Neutralization tests (sVNTs) and 
infection studies of human airway organoid cultures were performed with 
synthetic chimeras, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mimics and SARS-CoV-2 Omicron 
variants B.1.1.214, BA.1, BA.2 and BA.5.
RESULTS: ACE-2 mutations L27, V34 and E90 resulted in ultrahigh affinity binding 
of the LVE-ACE-2 domain to the widest variety of VOCs, with KDs of 93 pM and 73 
pM for binding to the Alpha B1.1.7 and Omicron B.1.1.529 variants, and notably, 
78fM, 133fM and 1.81pM affinities to the Omicron BA.2, BA2.75 and BQ.1.1 
subvariants, respectively. sVNT assays revealed titers of ≥4.9 ng/ml, for 
neutralization of recombinant viral proteins corresponding to the Alpha, Delta 
and Omicron variants. The values above were obtained with LVE-ACE-2/mAB chimeras 
containing the FcRn-binding Y-T-E sequence which extends biological half-life 
3-4-fold.
CONCLUSIONS: The ACE-2-mutant/Fc silent fusion proteins described have ultrahigh 
affinity to a wide variety of SARS-CoV-2 variants including Omicron. It is 
proposed that these chimeric ACE-2/mABs will constitute variant-agnostic and 
cost-effective prophylactics against SARS-CoV-2, particularly when administered 
nasally.

Developing a Noncontact Heating Matrix Spraying Apparatus with Controllable 
Matrix Film Formation for MALDI Mass Spectrometry Imaging.

Luo Y(1), Song C(1), Mao J(1), Peng Z(1), Sun S(1), Zhang Y(2)(3), Yu A(1), 
Zhang W(1)(2), Zhao W(1)(2), Ouyang G(1)(4).

Matrix deposition plays an important role in obtaining high-quality and reliable 
molecular spatial location information for matrix-assisted laser 
desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI). To control the 
matrix film formation, an automatic matrix spraying apparatus was developed with 
the introduction of a noncontact heating lamp. Compared with the unheated 
condition, the noncontact heating lamp suppressed the coffee-ring effect and the 
diffusion phenomenon of the analyte effectively by controllable matrix film 
formation. Meanwhile, the signal intensity was increased by 2-5 fold. To prove 
the ability of the matrix deposition apparatus, the apparatus combined with 
metabolomics analysis was used to show the spatial distribution of the substance 
in sprouted potato tubers. The potential biomarkers at m/z 868.5049 and m/z 
852.5101 were identified as α-solanine and α-chaconine, and the synthesis 
pathways were further searched. To further demonstrate the quality of MALDI 
images including localization and spatial resolution, lipid distribution in rat 
brain tissue was investigated by the developed noncontact heating matrix 
spraying apparatus. An excellent match with distinguishable compartments of 
lipids in the rat brain was obtained between the H&E-stained sections and 
MALDI-MSI images. These results indicate that the developed noncontact heating

Zhang T(1)(2), Chen X(1)(2), Xiong Y(1), Niu M(1)(2), Zhang Y(1)(2), Yan H(3), 
Li Y(1), Zhang X(1), Ma G(1).

Santalum album L., a semi-parasitic evergreen tree, contains economically 
important essential oil, rich in sesquiterpenoids, such as (Z) α- and (Z) 
β-santalol. However, their transcriptional regulations are not clear. Several 
studies of other plants have shown that basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) 
transcription factors (TFs) were involved in participating in the biosynthesis 
of sesquiterpene synthase genes. Herein, bHLH TF genes with similar expression 
patterns and high expression levels were screened by co-expression analysis, and 
their full-length ORFs were obtained. These bHLH TFs were named SaMYC1, SaMYC3, 
SaMYC4, SaMYC5, SabHLH1, SabHLH2, SabHLH3, and SabHLH4. All eight TFs had highly 
conserved bHLH domains and SaMYC1, SaMYC3, SaMYC4, and SaMYC5, also had highly 
conserved MYC domains. It was indicated that the eight genes belonged to six 
subfamilies of the bHLH TF family. Among them, SaMYC1 was found in both the 
nucleus and the cytoplasm, while SaMYC4 was only localized in the cytoplasm and 
the remaining six TFs were localized in nucleus. In a yeast one-hybrid 
experiment, we constructed decoy vectors pAbAi-SSy1G-box, pAbAi-CYP2G-box, 
pAbAi-CYP3G-box, and pAbAi-CYP4G-box, which had been transformed into yeast. We 
also constructed pGADT7-SaMYC1 and pGADT7-SabHLH1 capture vectors and 
transformed them into bait strains. Our results showed that SaMYC1 could bind to 
the G-box of SaSSy, and the SaCYP736A167 promoter, which SaSSy proved has acted 
as a key enzyme in the synthesis of santalol sesquiterpenes and SaCYP450 
catalyzed the ligation of santalol sesquiterpenes into terpene. We have also 
constructed pGreenII 62-SK-SaMYC1, pGreenII 0800-LUC-SaSSy and pGreenII 
0800-LUC-SaCYP736A167 via dual-luciferase fusion expression vectors and 
transformed them into Nicotiana benthamiana using an Agrobacterium-mediated 
method. The results showed that SaMYC1 was successfully combined with SaSSy or 
SaCYP736A167 promoter and the LUC/REN value was 1.85- or 1.55-fold higher, 
respectively, than that of the control group. Therefore, we inferred that SaMYC1 
could activate both SaSSy and SaCYP736A167 promoters.

Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling of immunoglobulin and antibody 
coadministration in patients with primary human immunodeficiency.

Salerno SN(1), Deng R(1)(2), Kakkar T(1).

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (2000 mg/kg) increased the clearance of the 
mouse monoclonal antibody 7E3, directed against platelet integrin IIb/IIIa 
(alpha IIb beta 3, CD41/CD61) in rodents. We wanted to investigate the effect of 
IVIG on clearance of monoclonal antibodies in humans as there is extremely 
limited data regarding this interaction in the literature. Using the tyrosine 
protein kinase KIT anti-cluster of differentiation 117 (c-Kit) humanized 
monoclonal antibody (JSP191) as a case study, we used physiologically-based 
pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling to evaluate the pharmacokinetic interaction 
between monoclonal antibodies and IVIG at doses (300-600 mg/kg) administered to 
patients with primary human immunodeficiency (PI). We first characterized the 
interaction between monoclonal antibodies and IVIG in PK-Sim®/MoBi® using 
published literature data, including the following: IVIG plus 7E3 in mice and 
rats and IVIG plus the human anti-C5 monoclonal antibody tesidolumab in adults 
with end-stage renal disease. We next developed a PBPK model using digitized 
data for JSPI91 alone in older adults with myelodysplastic syndrome and acute 
myeloid leukemia and in pediatric patients with severe combined immunodeficiency 
(SCID). Finally, we simulated the impact of IVIG (300-2000 mg/kg) 
coadministration with JSP191 on the area under the curve of JSP191 in patients 
with SCID. Model predictions were within 1.5-fold of observed values for 7E3 
plus IVIG and tesidolumab plus IVIG as well as for JSP191 administered alone. 
Based on our simulations, IVIG doses ≥500 mg exceeded the 80%-125% no-effect 
boundaries. IVIG treatment with monoclonal antibodies in patients with PI may 
result in a clinically significant interaction depending on the IVIG dose 
administered and the exposure-response relationship for the specific monoclonal 
antibody.

Impact of sex on neuroimmune contributions to Parkinson's disease.

Bourque M(1), Morissette M(2), Soulet D(3), Di Paolo T(4).

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder 
after Alzheimer's disease. Inflammation has been observed in both the idiopathic 
and familial forms of PD. Importantly, PD is reported more often in men than in 
women, men having at least 1.5- fold higher risk to develop PD than women. This 
review summarizes the impact of biological sex and sex hormones on the 
neuroimmune contributions to PD and its investigation in animal models of PD. 
Innate and peripheral immune systems participate in the brain neuroinflammation 
of PD patients and is reproduced in neurotoxin, genetic and α-synuclein based 
models of PD. Microglia and astrocytes are the main cells of the innate immune 
system in the central nervous system and are the first to react to restore 
homeostasis in the brain. Analysis of serum immunoprofiles in female and male 
control and PD patients show that a great proportion of these markers differ 
between males and females. The relationship between cerebrospinal fluid 
inflammatory markers and PD clinical characteristics or PD biomarkers shows sex 
differences. Conversely, in animal models of PD, sex differences in inflammation 
are well documented and the beneficial effects of endogenous and exogenous 
estrogenic modulation in inflammation have been reported. Targeting 
neuroinflammation in PD is an emerging therapeutic option but gonadal drugs have 
not yet been investigated in this respect, thus offering new opportunities for 
sex specific treatments.

Cocoa powder and fermented jackfruit seed flour: A comparative cell-based study 
on their potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities after simulated 
gastrointestinal digestion.

Saliba ASMC(5), Pedroso Gomes do Amaral JE(5), Purgatto E(1), de Alencar SM(2).

BACKGROUND: Jackfruit seed flour can be used as a cocoa aroma replacer with 
similar technological properties. The purpose of this study was to investigate 
the in vivo toxicity and in vitro antioxidant activity of fermented jackfruit 
seed flour (Fjs) and non-alkaline cocoa powder (Nac).
RESULTS: Fjs and Nac extracts (Fjs-E and Nac-E) were produced and submitted to 
in vitro gastrointestinal digestion producing digested fractions named Fjs-D and 
Nac-D, respectively. Nac-E showed over two-fold higher oxygen radical absorbance 
capacity (ORAC) than Fjs-E. However, after simulated gastrointestinal digestion 
(in vitro), there were no significant differences between Nac-D and Fjs-D 
(P < 0.01). Similarly, the cellular antioxidant activity (CAA) of Nac-D and 
Fjs-D was not significantly different (P < 0.01). The anti-inflammatory assay in 
transgenic RAW 264.7 murine macrophages showed that Fjs-E did not affect cell 
viability up to 300 μg mL-1 (P > 0.05) and reduced by 15% the release of TNF-α 
(P < 0.05). Fjs-D did not affect cell viability up to 300 μg mL-1 (P > 0.05) and 
showed 58% reduction of NF-κB activation (P < 0.05), with no effects on TNF-α 
levels. Treatment with Nac-E up to 300 μg mL-1 did not decrease cell viability 
(P > 0.05) and reduced the release of TNF-α levels by 34% and 66% at 100 and 
300 μg mL-1 , respectively (P < 0.05). Nac-D did not reduce the NF-κB activation 
or TNF-α levels at any tested concentration.
CONCLUSION: Collectively, these findings indicate that Fjs is a safe and 
promising functional ingredient with biological activities even after 
gastrointestinal digestion. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

Circulating Levels of Hypoxia-regulating MicroRNAs in Systemic Lupus 
Erythematosus Patients with Hemolytic Anemia.

Gamal-Eldeen AM(1)(2), Fahmy CA(3)(4), Raafat BM(5), Althobaiti F(6)(7), 
Bassyouni IH(8), Talaat RM(9).

OBJECTIVE: MicroRNAs are fine regulators for gene expression during the 
post-transcriptional stage in many autoimmune diseases. HypoxamiRs (miR-210 and 
miR-21) play an important role in hypoxia and in inflammation-associated 
hypoxia. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic systemic autoimmune 
disease that would potentiate many pathological complications, including 
hemolytic anemia. This study aimed to investigate the role of hypoxamiRs in 
SLE/hemolytic anemia patients.
METHODS: This work was designed to analyze the circulating levels of↱ the 
miR-210 and miR-21 expressions and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-α) in 
SLE/hemolytic anemia patients. SLE activity was evaluated for all patients by 
SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI). Clinical manifestations/complications and 
serological/hematological investigations were reported. HIF-α concentration was 
assayed by ELISA and expression of miR-21 and miR-210 was analyzed by qRT-PCR.
RESULTS: The results indicated that the fold change of the miR-210/miR-21 
expressions in plasma was significantly elevated in SLE/hemolytic anemia 
patients. A strong positive correlation between the miR-210 and miR-21 
expression levels was also recorded. Among the associated-disease complications, 
hypertension, arthritis, oral ulcers, and serositis were associated with a high 
circulating miR-210 expression, while the occurrence of renal disorders was 
associated with the increased miR-21 expression. Furthermore, the HIF-α level 
was remarkably elevated in SLE/hemolytic anemia patients. A high positive 
correlation was recorded between the HIF-α concentration and miR-210/miR-21 
expression levels. The occurrence of oral ulcers, arthritis, and hypertension 
was associated with the increased HIF-α concentration. On the other hand, SLEDAI 
and white blood cell count were positively correlated with miR-21/ miR-210. The 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate was positively correlated with miR-21.
CONCLUSION: The dysregulation of the circulating miR-210/miR-210/HIF-1α levels 
in SLE/hemolytic anemia patients advocated that the hypoxia pathway might have 
an essential role in the pathogenesis and complications of these diseases.

Highly Efficient Biotransformation and Production of Selenium Nanoparticles and 
Polysaccharides Using Potential Probiotic Bacillus subtilis T5.

X(1), Cheng S(1), He Y(1), Gao C(1), Wang Z(1)(2).

Selenium is an essential microelement required for human health. The 
biotransformation of selenium nanoparticles has attracted increasing attention 
in recent years. However, little of the literature has investigated the 
comprehensive evaluation of the strains for practical application and the effect 
on the functional properties in the existence of Se. The present study showed 
the selenite reduction strain Bacillus subtilis T5 (up to 200 mM), which could 
produce high yields of selenium polysaccharides and selenium nanoparticles in an 
economical and feasible manner. Biosynthesized selenium nanoparticles by B. 
subtilis T5 were characterized systematically using UV-vis spectroscopy, FTIR, 
Zeta Potential, DLS, and SEM techniques. The biosynthesized SeNPs exhibited high 
stability with small particle sizes. B. subtilis T5 also possessed a tolerance 
to acidic pH and bile salts, high aggregation, negative hemolytic, and superior 
antioxidant activity, which showed excellent probiotic potential and can be 
recommended as a potential candidate for the selenium biopharmaceuticals 
industry. Remarkably, B. subtilis T5 showed that the activity of α-amylase was 
enhanced with selenite treatment to 8.12 U/mL, 2.72-fold more than the control. 
The genus Bacillus was first reported to produce both selenium polysaccharides 
with extremely high Se-content (2.302 g/kg) and significantly enhance the 
activity to promote α-amylase with selenium treatment. Overall, B. subtilis T5 
showed potential as a bio-factory for the biosynthesized SeNPs and organ 
selenium (selenium polysaccharide), providing an appealing perspective for the 
biopharmaceutical industry.

Phosphorus Dendrimers for Metal-Free Ligation: Design of Multivalent 
Pharmacological Chaperones against Gaucher Disease.

Tran ML(1), Borie-Guichot M(1), Garcia V(2), Oukhrib A(3), Génisson Y(1), Levade 
T(4), Ballereau S(1), Turrin CO(3), Dehoux C(5).

The first phosphorus dendrimers built on a cyclotriphosphazene core and 
decorated with six or twelve monofluorocyclooctyne units were prepared. A simple 
stirring allowed the grafting of N-hexyl deoxynojirimycin inhitopes onto their 
surface by copper-free strain promoted alkyne-azide cycloaddition click 
reaction. The synthesized iminosugars clusters were tested as multivalent 
inhibitors of the biologically relevant enzymes β-glucocerebrosidase and acid 
α-glucosidase, involved in Gaucher and Pompe lysosomal storage diseases, 
respectively. For both enzymes, all the multivalent compounds were more potent 
than the reference N-hexyl deoxynojirimycin. Remarkably, final dodecavalent 
compound proved to be one of the best β-glucocerebrosidase inhibitors described 
to date. These cyclotriphosphazene-based deoxynojirimycin dendrimers were then 
evaluated as pharmacological chaperones against Gaucher disease. Not only did 
these multivalent constructs cross the cell membranes but they were also able to 
increase β-glucocerebrosidase activity in Gaucher cells. Notably, dodecavalent 
compound allowed a 1.4-fold enzyme activity enhancement at a concentration as 
low as 100 nM. These new monofluorocyclooctyne-presenting dendrimers may further 
find numerous applications in the synthesis of multivalent objects for 
biological and pharmacological purposes.

Improving the Activity and Stability of Serine Protease ThAPT3 by Alleviating 
Self-Cleavage and Its Application in Deproteinization of Shrimp Shells.

Wang X(1), Dong T(1), Zhou Q(1)(2), Tong L(1), Zheng J(1), Qin X(1), Wang X(1), 
Wang Y(1), Yao B(1), Huang H(1), Luo H(1).

The self-cleavage properties of proteases result in low activity and 
instability, which limit their industrial application. In this study, the serine 
protease ThAPT3 from Torrubiella hemipterigena was successfully expressed in 
Komagataella phaffii. We investigated the self-degradation mechanism of ThAPT3 
and presented a rational strategy to alleviate self-cleavage. A major 
self-degradation site (Leu238-Met239) and a primary autolysis region were 
identified. The autolysis regions (loop18, α8-helix, and loop19) were redesigned 
and optimized using loop transplantation, energy calculations, surface cavity 
optimization, and loop anchoring. A triple-superposition mutant, ThAPT3-M9 
(M239GKDGAVAAGLC250 → M239TLNRTTAANAC250/A251E/A254Q/R259L/A267E/S280N), was 
obtained. Compared to the wild type, the autolysis of M9 was significantly 
alleviated, and its half-life at 60 °C was increased approximately 39-fold (from 
1.6 to 62.4 min). The optimal temperature and specific activity of M9 increased 
by 5 °C (from 60 to 65 °C) and 62% (4985 vs 3078 U/mg), respectively. M9 showed 
significant advantages in shrimp shell deproteinization.

Synthesis of Novel Kidney-Type Glutaminase Allosteric Inhibitors Targeting the 
Critical Lys-320 Residue.

Song J(1), Pan C(1), Li J(1), Bai R(1), Zeng Z(1), Han Y(1), Chen Z(1), Hou 
W(1), Li Y(1), Ruan BH(1).

Reversible allosteric inhibitors of kidney-type glutaminase (GLS1, KGA) showed 
incomplete inhibition of cancer cell proliferation and poor in vivo efficacy. 
Here, we investigate some irreversible inhibitors targeting the critical K320 
residue responsible for GLS1 biological activity. The 
(trifluoromethoxy)phenylacetic acid motif was replaced by α,β-unsaturated 
carboxylic acids, and the resulting terminally substituted CB839 derivatives 
(e.g., GJ2 and GJ5) showed good stability in solid form at room temperature, and 
better liver microsome stability and in vivo pharmacokinetics than coumarin. 
Both compounds showed binding to the wild-type KGA, whose K D is 106-fold 
stronger than that of CB839, but only weak binding to the KGA K320A mutant and 
no inhibition of GDH proteins. Interestingly, GJ2 treatment significantly 
decreased the trypsin digestion of KGA, tumor cell clonal formation, and cancer 
cell growth rate. Taking these results together, targeting the critical K320 
residue of GLS1 might be a new strategy to make a potent GLS1 allosteric 
inhibitor.

Pankov G(1), Mol Avelar G(2), Buchanan G(2), Coulthurst SJ(2), Hunter WN(1).

Bacteria exploit specialized secretion systems to assist in competition for 
resources, in collaboration and in communication. Here, a protocol for the 
recombinant production, purification and crystallization of a protein linked to 
the Acinetobacter baumannii type VI secretion system is provided. A 
high-resolution structure of this trimeric protein is reported, revealing the 
characteristic dual β-α-β subunit fold typical of longer subunit members of the 
tautomerase superfamily. The protein does not appear to be toxic to bacteria or 
yeast under the conditions tested. The possible biological role of this protein 
is discussed.

Efficient whole cell biotransformation of tyrosol from L-tyrosine by engineered 
Escherichia coli.

Liu J(1), Wang K(1), Wang M(1), Deng H(2), Chen X(1), Shang Y(1), Liu X(1), Yu 
X(3).

An engineered Escherichia coli was constructed by co-expressing L-amino acid 
deaminase, α-keto acid decarboxylase, alcohol dehydrogenase, and glucose 
dehydrogenase through two plasmids for tyrosol production. The activity of the 
rate-limiting enzyme L-amino acid deaminase from Cosenzaea myxofaciens (CmAAD) 
toward tyrosine was improved by structure-guided modification. The enzyme 
activity of triple mutant CmAAD V438G/K147V/R151E toward tyrosine was ~5.12-fold 
higher than that of the wild-type CmAAD. Secondly, the plasmid copy numbers and 
the gene orders were optimized to improve the titer of tyrosol. Finally, the 
recombinant strain CS-6 transformed 10 mM tyrosine into 9.56 ± 0.64 mM tyrosol 
at 45 ℃, and the space-time yield reached 0.478 mM·L-1·h-1. This study proposes 
a novel idea for the efficient and natural production of tyrosol, which has 
great potential for industrial application.

Facile Preparation of UFMylation Activity-Based Probes by Chemoselective 
Installation of Electrophiles at the C-Terminus of Recombinant UFM1.

Tolmachova KA(1), Farnung J(1), Liang JR(2), Corn JE(2), Bode JW(1).

Aberrations in protein modification with ubiquitin-fold modifier (UFM1) are 
associated with a range of diseases, but the biological function and regulation 
of this post-translational modification, known as UFMylation, remain enigmatic. 
To provide activity-based probes for UFMylation, we have developed a new method 
for the installation of electrophilic warheads at the C-terminus of recombinant 
UFM1. A C-terminal UFM1 acyl hydrazide was readily produced by selective intein 
cleavage and chemoselectively acylated by a variety of carboxylic acid 
anhydrides at pH 3, without detriment to the folded protein or reactions at 
unprotected amino acid side chains. The resulting UFM1 activity-based probes 
show a range of tunable reactivity and high selectivity for proteins involved in 
UFMylation processes; structurally related E1s, E2s, and proteases associated 
with Ub or other Ubls were unreactive. The UFM1 probes were active both in cell 
lysates and in living cells. A previously inaccessible α-chloroacetyl probe was 
remarkably selective for covalent modification of the active-site cysteine of 
de-UFMylase UFSP2 in cellulo.

Infectious bronchitis virus infection in chicken: viral load and immune 
responses in Harderian gland, choanal cleft and turbinate tissues compared to 
trachea.

Al-Rasheed M(1)(2), Ball C(1), Manswr B(1)(3), Leeming G(1), Ganapathy K(1).

1. The role of the Harderian gland (HG), choanal cleft (CC) and turbinate in 
terms of IBV M41 viral load compared to the trachea, and immune (innate, 
cellular and mucosal) responses were studied in 21-day-old commercial broiler 
chickens.2. After virulent IBV M41 challenge, the antigen concentration detected 
either by quantitative RT-PCR or immunohistochemistry peaked at 2-3 days post 
challenge (dpc) in all tissues. Significant increases of lachrymal IBV-specific 
IgA and IgY levels were found at 4-5 dpc.3. Gene transcription showed a 
significant up-regulation of TLR3, MDA5, IL-6, IFN-α and IFN-β, where patterns 
and magnitude fold-change of mRNA transcription were dependent on the gene and 
tissue type.4. The results demonstrated active IBV M41 replication in the HG, CC 
and turbinate, comparable to levels of replication found in the trachea. Data on 
immune-related genes in head-associated tissues provide further understanding on 
the immunobiology of IBV and offer opportunities to identify their use as 
quantitative biomarkers in pathogenicity and vaccination-challenge studies.

During fibroproliferation, protein-associated extracellular aldehydes are formed 
by the oxidation of lysine residues on extracellular matrix proteins to form the 
aldehyde allysine. Here we report three Mn(II)-based, small molecule magnetic 
resonance (MR) probes that contain α-effect nucleophiles to target allysine in 
vivo and report on tissue fibrogenesis. We used a rational design approach to 
develop turn-on probes with a 4-fold increase in relaxivity upon targeting. The 
effects of aldehyde condensation rate and hydrolysis kinetics on the performance 
of the probes to detect tissue fibrogenesis noninvasively in mouse models were 
evaluated by a systemic aldehyde tracking approach. We showed that for highly 
reversible ligations, off-rate was a stronger predictor of in vivo efficiency, 
enabling histologically validated, three-dimensional characterization of 
pulmonary fibrogenesis throughout the entire lung. The exclusive renal 
elimination of these probes allowed for rapid imaging of liver fibrosis. 
Reducing the hydrolysis rate by forming an oxime bond with allysine enabled 
delayed phase imaging of kidney fibrogenesis. The imaging efficacy of these 
probes, coupled with their rapid and complete elimination from the body, make 
them strong candidates for clinical translation.

Activation and expansion of presynaptic signaling foci drives presynaptic 
homeostatic plasticity.

Orr BO(1), Fetter RD(1), Davis GW(2).

Comment in
    Neuron. 2022 Nov 16;110(22):3645-3647.

Presynaptic homeostatic plasticity (PHP) adaptively regulates synaptic 
transmission in health and disease. Despite identification of numerous genes 
that are essential for PHP, we lack a dynamic framework to explain how PHP is 
initiated, potentiated, and limited to achieve precise control of vesicle 
fusion. Here, utilizing both mice and Drosophila, we demonstrate that PHP 
progresses through the assembly and physical expansion of presynaptic signaling 
foci where activated integrins biochemically converge with trans-synaptic 
Semaphorin2b/PlexinB signaling. Each component of the identified signaling 
complexes, including alpha/beta-integrin, Semaphorin2b, PlexinB, talin, and 
focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and their biochemical interactions, are essential 
for PHP. Complex integrity requires the Sema2b ligand and complex expansion 
includes a ∼2.5-fold expansion of active-zone associated puncta composed of the 
actin-binding protein talin. Finally, complex pre-expansion is sufficient to 
accelerate the rate and extent of PHP. A working model is proposed incorporating 
signal convergence with dynamic molecular assemblies that instruct PHP.

validation in China.

Wang T(1), Jin M(2), Zhu R(2), Zheng L(3), Wang D(2), Zhao X(1)(2), Zhao X(2).

AIM: To develop a Chinese version of the return-to-work self-efficacy 
(RTW-SE-11) and verify its reliability and validity.
DESIGN: A validation study.
METHODS: The RTW-SE-11 was translated into Chinese according to the Brislin's 
model, and then the semantic adjustment of questionnaire was carried out through 
multi-field expert evaluation and preliminary investigation.
RESULTS: All 11 items of the original questionnaire were retained. Content 
validity index (CVI) of the Chinese version of RTW-SE-11 indicated good 
validity, with Inter-rater Agreement (IR) of 0.97, item CVI of 0.90-1.00 and 
questionnaire CVI of 0.91. Cronbach's α coefficient of RTW-SE-11 (Chinese 
version) was 0.923, suggesting high internal consistency, with test-retest 
reliability of 0.799 and half-fold reliability of 0.926. Patient or public 
contribution: The Chinese version of the RTW-SE-11 questionnaire confirmed good 
reliability and validity for the assessment of return to work self-efficacy in 
Chinese breast cancer patients.

Optical Initialization of Molecular Qubit Spin States Using Weak Exchange 
Coupling to Photogenerated Fullerene Triplet States.

Mao H(1), Young RM(1), Krzyaniak MD(1), Wasielewski MR(1).

The ability to initialize an electron spin qubit into a well-defined state is an 
important criterion for quantum information applications. To achieve this goal, 
a chromophore photoexcited to its triplet state is used to strongly spin 
polarize a nearby stable radical in a series of C60 fullerene derivatives 
containing a covalently linked α,γ-bisdiphenylene-β-phenylallyl (BDPA) radical. 
Selective photoexcitation of C60 results in up to 20-fold enhancement of the 
BDPA spin polarization observed by pulse electron paramagnetic resonance 
spectroscopy at room temperature. The sign of the spin polarization depends on 
the nature of the molecular spacer between C60 and BDPA. In addition, transient 
absorption spectroscopy and pulse-EPR measurements reveal that the BDPA spin 
polarization is derived from spin polarization transfer from the C60 triplet 
state by weak exchange coupling over a 1 nm distance.

protocells.

Synthetic biology is a rapidly growing field with applications in biotechnology 
and biomedicine. Through various approaches, remarkable achievements, such as 
cell and tissue engineering, have been already accomplished. In synthetic 
glycobiology, the engineering of glycan binding proteins is being exploited for 
producing tools with precise topology and specificity. We developed the concept 
of engineered chimeric lectins, i.e., Janus lectin, with increased valency, and 
additional specificity. The novel engineered lectin, assembled as a fusion 
protein between the β-propeller domain from Ralstonia solanacearum and the 
β-trefoil domain from fungus Marasmius oreades, is specific for fucose and 
α-galactose and its unique protein architecture allows to bind these ligands 
simultaneously. The protein activity was tested with glycosylated giant 
unilamellar vesicles, resulting in the formation of proto-tissue-like structures 
through cross-linking of such protocells. The engineered protein recognizes and 
binds H1299 human lung epithelial cancer cells by its two domains. The 
biophysical properties of this new construct were compared with the two already 
existing Janus lectins, RSL-CBM40 and RSL-CBM77Rf. Denaturation profiles of the 
proteins indicate that the fold of each has a significant role in protein 
stability and should be considered during protein engineering.

Genomics and transcriptomics-guided metabolic engineering Corynebacterium 
glutamicum for l-arginine production.

Zhao Z(1), Cai M(1), Liu Y(1), Hu M(1), Yang F(1), Zhu R(1), Xu M(1), Rao Z(2).

l-arginine is a semi-essential amino acid that is broadly used as food additives 
and pharmaceutical intermediates. The synthesis of l-arginine is restricted by 
complex metabolic mechanisms and suboptimal fermentation conditions. Initially, 
a mutant strain that accumulated 19.4 g/L l-arginine was generated by random 
mutagenesis. Subsequently, a mutation of the repressor protein (argRG159D) in 
the l-arginine operon and glutamate synthase (gltD) with 532-fold upregulation 
were identified to be vital for l-arginine production by multi-omic analysis. 
Systematic metabolic engineering was used to modify the strain, which included 
interfering with α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (ODHC) activity by 
knocking out serine/threonine-protein kinase (pknG), enhancing the expression of 
multiple key enzymes in the l-arginine synthesis pathway, and increasing the 
availability of intracellular cofactor (NADPH) and energy (ATP). Finally, C. 
glutamicum ARG12 produced 71.3 g/L l-arginine, with a yield of 0.43 g/g glucose 
by fermentation optimization. This study provides new ideas to boost l-arginine 
production.

Archaea: An under-estimated kingdom in livestock animals.

Chai J(1)(2)(3), Deng F(1)(2)(3), Li Y(1)(2), Zhao J(3).

Archaea are considered an essential group of gut microorganisms in both humans 
and animals. However, they have been neglected in previous studies, especially 
those involving non-ruminants. In this study, we re-analyzed published 
metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data sequenced from matched samples to 
explore the composition and the expression activity of gut archaea in ruminants 
(cattle and sheep) and monogastric animals (pig and chicken). Our results showed 
that the alpha and beta diversity of each host species, especially cattle and 
chickens, calculated from metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data were 
significantly different, suggesting that metatranscriptomic data better 
represent the functional status of archaea. We detected that the relative 
abundance of 17 (cattle), 7 (sheep), 20 (pig), and 2 (chicken) archaeal species 
were identified in the top 100 archaeal taxa when analyzing the metagenomic 
datasets, and these species were classified as the "active archaeal species" for 
each host species by comparison with corresponding metatranscriptomic data. For 
example, The expressive abundance in metatranscriptomic dataset of 
Methanosphaera cuniculi and Methanosphaera stadtmanae were 30- and 27-fold 
higher than that in metagenomic abundance, indicating their potentially 
important function in the pig gut. Here we aim to show the potential importance 
of archaea in the livestock digestive tract and encourage future research in 
this area, especially on the gut archaea of monogastric animals.

Resolving Confusion Surrounding d-Ala-d-Ala Ligase Catalysis in Cyanobacterial 
Mycosporine-Like Amino Acid (MAA) Biosynthesis.

Dextro RB(1), Fiore MF(1), Long PF(2).

Mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) are natural UV-absorbing sunscreens that 
evolved in cyanobacteria and algae to palliate harmful effects from obligatory 
exposure to solar radiation. Multiple lines of evidence prove that in 
cyanobacteria all MAAs are derived from mycosporine-glycine, which is typically 
modified by an ATP-dependent ligase encoded by the gene mysD. The function of 
the mysD ligase has been experimentally described but haphazardly named based 
solely upon sequence similarity to the d-alanine-d-alanine ligase of bacterial 
peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Combining phylogeny and alpha-fold tertiary protein 
structure prediction unambiguously distinguished mysD from d-alanine-d-alanine 
ligase. The renaming of mysD to mycosporine-glycine-amine ligase (MG-amine 
ligase) using recognised enzymology rules of nomenclature is, therefore, 
proposed, and considers relaxed specificity for several different amino acid 
substrates. The evolutionary and ecological context of MG-amine ligase catalysis 
merits wider appreciation especially when considering exploiting cyanobacteria 
for biotechnology, for example, producing mixtures of MAAs with enhanced optical 
or antioxidant properties.

Computing the Volume, Surface Area, Mean, and Gaussian Curvatures of Molecules 
and Their Derivatives.

Koehl P(1), Akopyan A(2), Edelsbrunner H(3).

Geometry is crucial in our efforts to comprehend the structures and dynamics of 
biomolecules. For example, volume, surface area, and integrated mean and 
Gaussian curvature of the union of balls representing a molecule are used to 
quantify its interactions with the water surrounding it in the morphometric 
implicit solvent models. The Alpha Shape theory provides an accurate and 
reliable method for computing these geometric measures. In this paper, we derive 
homogeneous formulas for the expressions of these measures and their derivatives 
with respect to the atomic coordinates, and we provide algorithms that implement 
them into a new software package, AlphaMol. The only variables in these formulas 
are the interatomic distances, making them insensitive to translations and 
rotations. AlphaMol includes a sequential algorithm and a parallel algorithm. In 
the parallel version, we partition the atoms of the molecule of interest into 3D 
rectangular blocks, using a kd-tree algorithm. We then apply the sequential 
algorithm of AlphaMol to each block, augmented by a buffer zone to account for 
atoms whose ball representations may partially cover the block. The current 
parallel version of AlphaMol leads to a 20-fold speed-up compared to an 
independent serial implementation when using 32 processors. For instance, it 
takes 31 s to compute the geometric measures and derivatives of each atom in a 
viral capsid with more than 26 million atoms on 32 Intel processors running at 
2.7 GHz. The presence of the buffer zones, however, leads to redundant 
computations, which ultimately limit the impact of using multiple processors. 
AlphaMol is available as an OpenSource software.

Phylogenetic Analyses of Microbial Hydrolytic Dehalogenases Reveal Polyphyletic 
Origin.

Lal D(1), Pandey H(2), Lal R(3)(4).

Hydrolytic dehalogenases form an important class of dehalogenases that include 
haloacid dehalogenase, haloalkane dehalogenase, haloacetate dehalogenase, and 
atrazine chlorohydrolase. These enzymes are involved in biodegradation of 
various environmental pollutants and therefore it is important to understand 
their phylogeny. In the present study, it was found that the enzymes haloalkane 
and haloacetate dehalogenases share a common ancestry with enzymes such as 
carboxyesterase, epoxide hydrolase, and lipases, which can be traced to 
ancestral α/β hydrolase fold enzyme. Haloacid dehalogenases and atrazine 
chlorohydrolases have probabaly evolved from ancestral enzymes with phosphatase 
and deaminases activity, respectively. These findings were supported by the 
similarities in the secondary structure, key catalytic motifs and placement of 
catalytic residues. The phylogeny of haloalkane dehalogenases and haloacid 
dehalogenases differs from 16S rRNA gene phylogeny, suggesting spread through 
horizontal gene transfer. Hydrolytic dehalogenases are polyphyletic and do not 
share a common evolutionay history, the functional similarities are due to 
convergent evolution. The present study also identifies key functional residues, 
mutating which, can help in generating better enzymes for clean up of the 
persistent environmental pollutants using enzymatic bioremediation.

[Mechanism of famous classical formula Huaihua Powder in treatment of ulcerative 
colitis based on metabonomics].

[Article in Chinese]

Han LY(1), Yu H(1), Li TJ(2), Wang S(2), Bao YR(2), Meng XS(2).

Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time of flight tandem 
mass spectrometry(UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS) was employed in this study to observe the 
effect of Huaihua Powder on the serum metabolites of mice with ulcerative 
colitis and reveal the mechanism of Huaihua Powder in the treatment of 
ulcerative colitis. The mouse model of ulcerative colitis was established by 
dextran sodium sulfate salt(DSS). The therapeutic effect of Huaihua Powder on 
ulcerative colitis was preliminarily evaluated based on the disease activity 
index(DAI), colon appearance, colon tissue morphology, and the content of 
inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α(TNF-α), 
interleukin-6(IL-6), and interleukin-1β(IL-1β). UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS was employed to 
profile the endogenous metabolites of serum samples in blank control group, 
model group, and low-, medium-, and high-dose Huaihua Powder groups. 
Multivariate analyses such as principal component analysis(PCA), partial least 
squares discriminant analysis(PLS-DA), and orthogonal partial least squares 
discriminant analysis(OPLS-DA) were performed for pattern recognition. Potential 
biomarkers were screened by Mass Profiler Professional(MPP) B.14.00 with the 
thresholds of fold change≥2 and P&lt;0.05. The metabolic pathways were enriched 
by MetaboAnalyst 5.0. The results showed that Huaihua Powder significantly 
improved the general state and colon tissue morphology of mice with ulcerative 
colitis, reduced DAI, and lowered the levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β in serum. 
A total of 38 potential biomarkers were predicted to be related to the 
regulatory effect of Huaihua Powder, which were mainly involved in 
glycerophospholipid metabolism, glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism, 
mutual transformation of glucuronic acid, and glutathione metabolism. This study 
employed metabolomics to analyze the mechanism of Huaihua Powder in the 
treatment of ulcerative colitis, laying a foundation for the further research.

[Mechanism of Cyathulae Radix in treatment of knee osteoarthritis based on 
metabolomics].

[Article in Chinese]

Liu SJ(1), Li JP(1), Wang YZ(2), Li KZ(1), Zhu YT(1), Feng WS(2).

Metabolomics based on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem 
quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry(UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS) was employed to 
analyze the effect of Cyathulae Radix on serum and urine in rats with knee 
osteoarthritis, and to decipher the mechanism of Cyathulae Radix in the 
treatment of knee osteoarthritis. SD rats were randomized into a normal group, a 
model group, a positive drug group, and a Cyathulae Radix group. The knee 
osteoarthritis model was established by injecting 2% pa-pain and 0.03 mol·L~(-1) 
cysteine, and the serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-α(TNF-α) and matrix 
metalloproteinase-3(MMP-3) in the model group was measured to preliminarily 
evaluate the therapeutic effect of Cyathulae Radix on knee osteoarthritis. 
UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS was employed to establish the metabolic profile of endogenous 
small molecule metabolites in the four groups. Potential biomarkers were 
screened out by multivariate analysis methods such as partial least squares 
discriminant analysis(PLS-DA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant 
analysis(OPLS-DA) in combination with t-test, variable importance for 
projection(VIP), and fold-change. The related metabolic pathways were enriched 
with the help of MetaboAnalyst 5.0. The results showed that Cyathulae Radix 
alleviated the general signs of rats with knee osteoarthritis, and reduced the 
levels of TNF-α and MMP-3 in the rat serum. Twenty-eight differential 
metabolites that might be associated with the therapeutic effect of Cyathulae 
Radix were screened out from serum and urine. They were mainly involved in 
arginine biosynthesis, nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, tricarboxylic 
acid cycle, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, riboflavin metabolism, 
glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, and pyrimidine metabolism. Through 
metabonomics analysis, this study predicted the possible mechanism of Cyathulae 
Radix in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis, which laid a foundation for 
further research.

Structures and comparison of endogenous 2-oxoglutarate and pyruvate 
dehydrogenase complexes from bovine kidney.

Liu S(#)(1)(2), Xia X(#)(1)(2), Zhen J(#)(1)(2)(3), Li Z(1)(2), Zhou 
ZH(4)(5)(6).

The α-keto acid dehydrogenase complex family catalyzes the essential oxidative 
decarboxylation of α-keto acids to yield acyl-CoA and NADH. Despite performing 
the same overarching reaction, members of the family have different component 
structures and structural organization between each other and across 
phylogenetic species. While native structures of α-keto acid dehydrogenase 
complexes from bacteria and fungi became available recently, the atomic 
structure and organization of their mammalian counterparts in native states 
remain unknown. Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of the 
endogenous cubic 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDC) and icosahedral 
pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) cores from bovine kidney determined at 
resolutions of 3.5 Å and 3.8 Å, respectively. The structures of multiple 
proteins were reconstructed from a single lysate sample, allowing direct 
structural comparison without the concerns of differences arising from sample 
preparation and structure determination. Although native and recombinant E2 core 
scaffold structures are similar, the native structures are decorated with their 
peripheral E1 and E3 subunits. Asymmetric sub-particle reconstructions support 
heterogeneity in the arrangements of these peripheral subunits. In addition, 
despite sharing a similar monomeric fold, OGDC and PDC E2 cores have distinct 
interdomain and intertrimer interactions, which suggests a means of modulating 
self-assembly to mitigate heterologous binding between mismatched E2 species. 
The lipoyl moiety lies near a mobile gatekeeper within the interdomain active 
site of OGDC E2 and PDC E2. Analysis of the twofold related intertrimer 
interface identified secondary structural differences and chemical interactions 
between icosahedral and cubic geometries of the core. Taken together, our study 
provides a direct structural comparison of OGDC and PDC from the same source and 
offers new insights into determinants of interdomain interactions and of 
architecture diversity among α-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes.

Signal strength of STING activation determines cytokine plasticity and cell 
death in human monocytes.

Kabelitz D(1), Zarobkiewicz M(2)(3), Heib M(2), Serrano R(2)(4), Kunz M(2), 
Chitadze G(5), Adam D(2), Peters C(2).

The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)/stimulator of interferon genes (STING) 
pathway is a cytosolic sensor of microbial and host-derived DNA and plays a key 
role in innate immunity. Activation of STING by cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) 
ligands in human monocytes induces a type I interferon response and production 
of pro-inflammatory cytokines associated with the induction of massive cell 
death. In this study we have re-evaluated the effect of signal strength of STING 
activation on the cytokine plasticity of human monocytes. CDN (2'3'c-GAMP) and 
non-CDN (diABZI, MSA-2) STING ligands in the range of EC50 concentrations (15 μM 
2'3'c-GAMP, 100 nM diABZI, 25 μM MSA-2) induced IFN-β, IP-10, and large amounts 
of IL-1β and TNF-α, but no IL-10 or IL-19. Interestingly, LPS-induced production 
of IL-10 and IL-19 was abolished in the presence of diABZI or MSA-2, whereas 
IL-1β and TNF-α were not inhibited. Surprisingly, we observed that tenfold lower 
(MSA-2, i.e. 2.5 μM) or 100-fold lower (diABZI, i.e. 1 nM) concentrations 
strongly stimulated secretion of anti-inflammatory IL-10 and IL-19, but little 
of IL-1β and TNF-α. Induction of IL-10 was associated with up-regulation of 
PRDM1 (Blimp-1). While cytokine secretion stimulated by the higher 
concentrations was accompanied by apoptosis as shown by cleavage of caspase-3 
and PARP-1, the low concentrations did not trigger overt cell death yet induced 
cleavage of gasdermin-D. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized plasticity 
of human monocytes in their signal strength-dependent production of pro- versus 
anti-inflammatory cytokines upon STING activation.

Inhibition of Vascular Inflammation by Apolipoprotein A-IV.

Shearston K(1), Tan JTM(2)(3), Cochran BJ(1), Rye KA(1).

BACKGROUND: Apolipoprotein (apo) A-IV, the third most abundant apolipoprotein in 
human high density lipoproteins (HDLs), inhibits intestinal and systemic 
inflammation. This study asks if apoA-IV also inhibits acute vascular 
inflammation.
METHODS: Inflammation was induced in New Zealand White rabbits by placing a 
non-occlusive silastic collar around the common carotid artery. A single 1 mg/kg 
intravenous infusion of lipid-free apoA-IV or saline (control) was administered 
to the animals 24 h before collar insertion. The animals were euthanised 24 h 
post-collar insertion. Human coronary artery cells (HCAECs) were pre-incubated 
with reconstituted HDLs containing apoA-IV complexed with phosphatidylcholine, 
(A-IV)rHDLs, then activated by incubation with tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α. 
Cell surface vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular 
adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in the TNF-α-activated HCAECs was quantified by 
flow cytometry. VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and 3β-hydroxysteroid-Δ24 reductase (DHCR24) mRNA 
levels were quantified by real time PCR.
RESULTS: Apolipoprotein ApoA-IV treatment significantly decreased collar-induced 
endothelial expression of VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and neutrophil infiltration into the 
arterial intima by 67.6 ± 9.9% (p < 0.01), 75.4 ± 6.9% (p < 0.01) and 74.4 ± 
8.5% (p < 0.05), respectively. It also increased endothelial expression of 
DHCR24 by 2.6-fold (p < 0.05). Pre-incubation of HCAECs with (A-IV)rHDLs prior 
to stimulation with TNF-α inhibited VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 protein levels by 62.2 ± 
12.1% and 33.7 ± 5.7%, respectively. VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 mRNA levels were 
decreased by 55.8 ± 7.2% and 49.6 ± 7.9%, respectively, while DHCR24 mRNA 
expression increased by threefold. Transfection of HCAECs with DHCR24 siRNA 
attenuated the anti-inflammatory effects of (A-IV)rHDLs. Pre-incubation of 
TNF-α-activated HCAECs with (A-IV)rHDLs also inhibited nuclear translocation of 
the p65 subunit of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and decreased IκBα 
phosphorylation.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that apoA-IV inhibits vascular inflammation 
in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting NF-κB activation in a DHCR24-dependent 
manner.

Engineered Fenofibrate as Oxidation-Sensitive Nanoparticles with ROS Scavenging 
and PPARα-Activating Bioactivity to Ameliorate Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.

Du K(1)(2)(3), Huang X(1)(2)(3), Peng A(1)(2)(3), Yang Q(4), Chen D(1)(2)(3), 
Zhang J(4), Qi R(1)(2)(3).

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver 
disease in western countries and China. Fenofibrate (FNB) can activate 
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) to increase fatty acid 
oxidation and ameliorate NAFLD. However, the application of FNB is limited in 
clinic due to its poor water solubility and low oral bioavailability. In this 
study, FNB-loaded nanoparticles (FNB-NP) based on a reactive oxygen species 
(ROS)-responsive peroxalate ester derived from vitamin E (OVE) and an 
amphiphilic conjugate 
1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(poly(ethylene 
glycol))-2000] (DSPE-PEG) were developed to enhance the preventive effects of 
FNB against NAFLD. In in vitro studies, FNB-NP displayed a high encapsulation 
efficiency of 97.25 ± 0.6% and a drug loading efficiency of 29.67 ± 0.1%, with a 
size of 197.0 ± 0.2 nm. FNB released from FNB-NP was dramatically accelerated in 
the medium with high H2O2 concentrations. Moreover, FNB-NP exhibited well 
storage stability and plasma stability. In pharmacokinetic (PK) studies, FNB-NP, 
compared with FNB crude drug, significantly increased the AUC0→t and AUC0→∞ of 
the plasma FNB acid by 3.3- and 3.4-fold, respectively. In pharmacodynamics (PD) 
studies, compared with an equal dose of FNB crude drug, FNB-NP more 
significantly reduced hepatic lipid deposition via facilitating FNB release in 
the liver and further upregulating PPARα expression in NAFLD mice. Meanwhile, 
oxidative stress in NAFLD was significantly suppressed after FNB-NP 
administration, suggesting that OVE plays a synergistic effect on antioxidation. 
Therefore, ROS-sensitive FNB delivery formulations FNB-NP enhance the preventive 
effects of FNB against NAFLD and could be further studied as a promising drug 
for the treatment of NAFLD in clinic.

Infection is one of the leading causes of mortality in thalassemia patients. 
This study aimed to examine qualitative and quantitative changes in monocytes in 
thalassemia patients. Monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells and separated into subpopulations by flow cytometry. Cytokine levels were 
measured using quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain 
reaction (qRT-PCR) and sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The 
primary endpoint was monocyte-derived TNF-α expression. A total of 78 patients 
and 26 controls were included. The mean log (TNF-α fold-change) by qRT-PCR was 
significantly lower in all thalassemia groups, at 1.27 in controls, versus 0.97 
(p = 0.0014) in non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia (NTDT), 0.96 (p = 0.0004) 
in non-splenectomized transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT-NS), and 0.87 
(p < 0.0001) in splenectomized transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT-S). 
Similarly, the mean 2-h TNF-α level measured by sandwich ELISA assay was 
significantly lower in all thalassemia groups, at 98.16 pg/mL in controls, 
versus 56.45 pg/mL (p = 0.0093) in NTDT, 39.05 pg/mL (p = 0.0001) in TDT-NS and 
32.37 pg/mL (p < 0.0001) in TDT-S. Likewise, TDT patients had a significantly 
decreased percentage of non-classical monocytes, by approximately half compared 
to controls. Our results show that thalassemia major patients have clearly 
impaired monocyte counts and function.

ThB(2)O(5).

A novel polymorph of ThB2O5, denoted as β-ThB2O5, was synthesised under 
high-temperature high-pressure (HT/HP) conditions. Via single crystal X-ray 
diffraction measurements, β-ThB2O5 was found to form a three-dimensional (3D) 
framework structure where thorium atoms are ten-fold oxygen coordinated forming 
tetra-capped trigonal prisms. The only other known polymorph of ThB2O5, denoted 
α, synthesised herein using a known borax, B2O3-Na2B4O7, high temperature solid 
method, was found to transform to the β polymorph when exposed to conditions of 
4 GPa and ∼900 °C. Compared to the α polymorph, β-ThB2O5 has smaller molar 
volume by approximately 12%. Exposing a mixture of the α and β polymorphs to 
HT/HP conditions ex situ further demonstrated the preferred higher-pressure 
phase being β, with no α phase material being observed via Rietveld refinements 
against laboratory X-ray powder diffraction (PXRD) measurements. In situ heating 
PXRD measurements on α-ThB2O5 from RT to 1030 °C indicated that α-ThB2O5 
transforms to the β variant at approximately 900 °C via a 1st order mechanism. 
β-ThB2O5 was found to exist only over a narrow temperature range, decomposing 
above 1050 °C. Ab initio calculations using density functional theory (DFT) with 
the Hubbard U parameter indicated, consistent with experimental observations, 
that β is both the preferred phase at higher temperatures and high pressures. 
Interestingly, it was found by switching from B2O3-Na2B4O7 to H3BO3-Li2CO3 flux 
using consistent high temperature solid state conditions for the synthesis of 
the α variant, β-ThB2O5 could be generated. Comparison of their single crystal 
measurements showed this was identical to that obtained from HT/HP conditions.

INTRODUCTION: A subset of individuals with COVID-19 can suffer from a severe 
form of the disease requiring breathing support for respiratory failure and even 
death due to disease complications. COVID-19 disease severity can be attributed 
to numerous factors, where several studies have associated changes in the 
expression of serum pro-inflammatory cytokines with disease severity. However, 
very few studies have associated the changes in expression of pro-inflammatory 
changes in the nasopharyngeal milieu with disease severity. Therefore, in the 
current study, we performed differential gene expression analysis of various 
pro-inflammatory cytokines in the nasopharyngeal milieu of mild & severe 
COVID-19 cases.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: For this retrospective, cross-sectional study, a total of 
118 nasopharyngeal swab samples, previously collected from mild and severe 
(based on the WHO criteria) COVID-19 patients were used. A real-time qPCR was 
performed to determine the viral loads and also evaluate the mRNA expression of 
eight cytokines (IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ, TGF-β1, and TNF-α). 
Subsequently, an unpaired T-test was applied to compare the statistical 
difference in mean expression of viral loads and each cytokine between the mild 
and severe groups, while the Pearson correlation test was applied to establish a 
correlation between disease severity, viral load, and cytokines expression. 
Similarly, a multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to assess 
the relationship between different variables from the data and disease severity.
RESULTS: Out of 118 samples, 71 were mild, while 47 were severe. The mean viral 
load between the mild and severe groups was comparable (mild group: 27.07± 5.22; 
severe group: 26.37 ±7.89). The mRNA expression of cytokines IL-2, IL-6, IFN- γ, 
and TNF-α was significantly different in the two groups (p<0.05), where the Log2 
normalized expression of IL-2, IL-6, IFN- γ, and TNF-α was found to be 2.2-, 
16-, 2.3-, and 1.73-fold less in the severe group as compared to the mild group. 
Furthermore, we also observed a significant positive correlation between all the 
cytokines in the severe group. The multivariate analysis showed a significant 
relationship between age, IL-6, and disease severity.
CONCLUSION: This decreased expression of certain cytokines (IL-2, IL-6, TNF-α, 
and IFN-γ) in the nasopharyngeal milieu may be considered early biomarkers for 
disease severity in COVID-19 patients.

Pro-Inflammatory and Anti-Inflammatory Cytokines Levels are Significantly 
Altered in Cerebrospinal Fluid of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysm (UIA) 
Patients.

INTRODUCTION: Identifying all the relevant "players" in the formation and 
development of brain aneurysms may help understand the mechanisms responsible 
for the formation of an aneurysm, as well as in the search for non-invasive 
targets for aneurysm pharmacotherapy.
AIM: The evaluation of the concentration of pro-inflammatory and 
anti-inflammatory cytokines in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum of patients 
with unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIA) in comparison to individuals 
without vascular lesions in the brain.
METHODS: The concentration of 27 proteins in the CSF and serum of UIA patients 
(N = 40) and individuals without vascular lesions in the brain (N = 15) was 
evaluated using a multiplex ELISA kit (Bio-Plex Pro Human Cytokine 27-Plex 
Panel).
RESULTS: In the CSF 13 out of 27 proteins evaluated presented a concentration 
1.36-fold or greater in UIA patients in comparison to the control group. 
Significantly higher were IL-1β, IL-1ra, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-7, IL-8, IL-12, 
IL-13, TNF-α, INF-γ, MCP-1, and VEGF. In the serum none of the proteins 
evaluated significantly differ between UIA patients and the control group. The 
correlation coefficient analysis showed that CSF IL-1β, IL-8, and TNF-α 
positively, while IL-13 negatively correlated with the size of aneurysms. CSF 
IL-6 and MCP-1 concentrations positively correlated with the number of 
aneurysms.
CONCLUSION: In patients with UIA, pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory 
mechanisms are activated simultaneously, because the concentration of promoting 
and suppressing inflammatory response proteins was significantly higher in CSF 
of UIA patients compared to the control group. The preventive therapy of brain 
aneurysm development should be focused on IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and TNF-α, 
the concentration of which in CSF positively correlated with the size and number 
of aneurysms.

NT, Yilmaz H, Eryigit OY, Gareayaghi N, Kocazeybek BS.

BACKGROUND: Obesity may also develop due to a viral infection caused by 
adenovirus 36. We aimed to detect the presence of neutralizing antibodies 
against Ad-36 in adult patients who developed type 2 diabetes due to obesity 
(BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2).
METHODS: The patient group (PG) was composed of 80 obese people with type 2 
diabetes, the patient control group (PCG) was composed of 40 non-obese people 
with type 2 diabetes, and the healthy control group (HCG) was com-posed of 40 
non-obese people without type 1 or type 2 diabetes in this case-control study. 
The presence of Ad-36 neutralizing antibodies was studied by serum 
neutralization assay.
RESULTS: A significant difference was found between the PG and HCG in terms of 
Ad-36 antibody positivity (p < 0.0001) but no significant difference was 
detected between the PG and the PCG (p > 0.05). BMI, serum leptin, adiponectin, 
and triglyceride levels were significantly higher in the PG (p < 0.05). 
Conversely, TNF-α and IL-6 levels were significantly lower in the PG (p < 
0.0001). When the two groups were compared, the mean levels of total 
cho-lesterol and LDL in the PG were found to be high, although not significant 
(p > 0.05). In type 2 diabetes patients (n = 120), age, BMI, HDL, LDL, 
triglyceride, total cholesterol, Ad-36 presence, leptin, adiponectin, TNF-α, and 
IL-6 parameters were taken as independent variables for logistic regression. 
While BMIs was found to be significant (odds ration [OR] = 2.358; p = 0.0001, 
95% Cl 1.507 - 3.690, Ad-36 presence was found to be a significant (OR = 27.352; 
p = 0.003, 95% Cl 3.157 - 236.961). Our study showed that BMI and Ad-36 increase 
type 2 diabetes risk by 2.3 and 27.3-fold in the PG and PCG (type 2 diabetes 
patients) versus the HCG. There was also a significant difference between PCG 
and HCG.
CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that Ad-36 seropositivity is also a risk factor for the 
development of type 2 diabetes independent of being obese.

Does immune dysregulation contribute towards development of hypopigmentation in 
Indian post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis?

Post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), a sequel of apparently cured 
visceral leishmaniasis (VL) presents with papulonodular (polymorphic) or 
hypopigmented lesions (macular) and is the proposed disease reservoir. As 
hypopigmentation appears consistently in PKDL, especially the macular form, this 
study aimed to delineate immune factors that singly or in combination could 
contribute towards this hypopigmentation. At lesional sites, the presence of 
melanocytes and CD8+ T-cells was assessed by immunohistochemistry and mRNA 
expression of melanogenic markers (tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein-1 and 
MITF) by droplet digital PCR, while plasma levels of cytokines and chemokines 
were measured by a multiplex assay. In comparison with skin from healthy 
individuals, macular PKDL demonstrated a near total absence of Melan-A+ cells at 
dermal sites, while the polymorphic cases demonstrated a 3.2-fold decrease, 
along with a dramatic reduction in the expression of key enzymes related to the 
melanogenesis signalling pathway in both forms. The levels of circulating IFN-γ, 
IL-6, IL-2, IL-1β, TNF-α and IFN-γ-inducible chemokines (CXCL9/10/11) were 
elevated and was accompanied by an increased lesional infiltration of CD8+ 
T-cells. The proportion of CD8+ T-cells correlated strongly with plasma levels 
of IFN-γ (r = 0.8), IL-6 (r = 0.9, p < 0.05), IL-2 (r = 0.7), TNF-α (r = 0.9, 
p < 0.05) and IL-1β (r = 0.7), as also with CXCL9 (r = 0.5) and CXCL10 
(r = 0.6). Taken together, the absence/reduction in Melan-A suggested 
hypopigmentation in PKDL was associated with the destruction of melanocytes, 
following the impairment of the melanogenesis pathway. Furthermore, the presence 
of CD8+ T-cells and an enhanced IFN-γ-associated immune milieu suggested the 
generation of a pro-inflammatory landscape that facilitated melanocyte 
dysfunction/destruction.

Effects of severe obstructive sleep apnea on functional prognosis in the acute 
phase of ischemic stroke and quantitative electroencephalographic markers.

Xu J(1), Wang J(2), Wu H(3), Han F(3), Wang Q(3), Jiang Y(4), Chen R(5).

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on 
functional prognosis in the acute phase and quantitative electroencephalography 
(EEG) markers during sleep in ischemic stroke patients.
METHODS: This study included 125 mild-to-moderate acute ischemic stroke patients 
with OSA who underwent polysomnography (PSG) within one week of stroke onset 
between January 2015 and June 2020. Patients were grouped according to their 
apnea-hypopnea index (</≥ 30/h). Poor functional prognosis was defined as 
modified Rankin Scale score ≥3. The EEG recorded by PSG was extracted during 
different sleep stages for power spectrum analysis. The delta/alpha power ratio 
(DAR), (delta + theta)/(alpha + beta) ratio (the slowing ratio, TSR), and the 
relative power (RP) of each frequency band were calculated. Differences in 
clinical, PSG, and quantitative EEG characteristics were compared between the 
groups. Additionally, we explored predictors of poor functional prognosis.
RESULTS: Patients with severe OSA had a higher proportion of hypertension, lower 
relative power of high-frequency bands, and higher delta RP, TSR, and DAR 
(p < 0.05). Severe OSA was associated with a 3.6-fold increase in risk of poor 
prognosis (p < 0.05). Increased delta RP and TSR, as well as decreased alpha, 
beta, and sigma RP, may be independent predictors of a poor functional 
prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Severe OSA is an independent risk factor for a poor functional 
prognosis in patients with acute ischemic stroke, and quantitative EEG during 
sleep showed a significant slow wave enhancement, suggesting more severe brain 
dysfunction. The treatment of severe OSA may improve functional prognosis.

Microsecond MD Simulations of the Plexin-B1 RBD: 2. N-H Probability Densities 
and Conformational Entropy in Ligand-Free, Rac1-Bound, and Dimer RBD.

Mendelman N(1), Pshetitsky Y(1), Li Z(2), Zerbetto M(3), Buck M(2), Meirovitch 
E(1).

Orientational probability densities, Peq = exp(-u) (u, local potential), of 
bond-vectors in proteins provide information on structural flexibility. The 
related conformational entropy, Sk = -∫Peq(ln Peq)dΩ - ln ∫dΩ, provides the 
entropic contribution to the free energy of the physical/biological process 
studied. We have developed a new method for deriving Peq and Sk from MD 
simulations, using the N-H bond as probe. Recently we used it to study the 
dimerization of the Rho GTPase binding domain of Plexin-B1 (RBD). Here we use it 
to study RBD binding to the small GTPase Rac1. In both cases 1 μs MD simulations 
have been employed. The RBD has the ubiquitin fold with four mostly long loops. 
L3 is associated with GTPase binding, L4 with RBD dimerization, L2 participates 
in interdomain interactions, and L1 has not been associated with function. We 
find that RBD-Rac1 binding renders L1, L3, and L4 more rigid and the turns β2/α1 
and α2/β5 more flexible. By comparison, RBD dimerization renders L4 more rigid, 
and the α-helices, the β-strands, and L2 more flexible. The rigidity of L1 in 
RBDRAC is consistent with L1-L3 contacts seen in previous MD simulations. The 
analysis of the L3-loop reveals two states of distinct flexibility which we 
associate with involvement in slow conformational exchange processes differing 
in their rates. Overall, the N-H bonds make an unfavorable entropic contribution 
of (5.9 ± 0.9) kJ/mol to the free energy of RBD-Rac1 binding; they were found to 
make a favorably contribution of (-7.0 ± 0.7) kJ/mol to the free energy of RBD 
dimerization. In summary, the present study provides a new perspective on the 
impact of Rac1 binding and dimerization on the flexibility characteristics of 
the RBD. Further studies are stimulated by the results of this work.

In Vivo Imaging of Neo-angiogenesis of Transplanted Metastases in Subrenal 
Capsule Assay Induced Rat Model.

Kepes Z(1), Hajdu I(1), Joszai I(1), Emri M(1), Kertesz I(1), Mezo G(4)(5), 
Trencsenyi G(6)(2).

BACKGROUND/AIM: Changes in the expression of neo-angiogenic molecules in the 
primary tumor and its metastases may significantly affect the efficacy of 
therapies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the alterations in 
aminopeptidase N (APN/CD13) and αvβ3 integrin receptor expression in serially 
transplanted mesoblastic nephroma tumor (Ne/De) metastases using 68Gallium 
(68Ga)-labeled NOTA-cNGR and NODAGA-RGD radiotracers and preclinical positron 
emission tomography (PET) imaging.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary and metastatic mesoblastic nephroma (Ne/De) 
tumors were induced by subrenal capsule assay (SRCA) in Fischer-344 rats. In 
vivo PET imaging experiments were performed 8±1 days after the SRCA surgery 
using intravenously injected 68Ga-NOTA-c(NGR), 68Ga-NODAGA-RGD, and [18F]FDG 
radiotracers.
RESULTS: Among the examined neo-angiogenic molecules, the expression of αvß3 
integrin in the tumors was significantly lower than that of APN/CD13. This 
observation was confirmed by the PET data analysis, where a 2-6-fold higher 
APN/CD13-specific 68Ga-NOTA-cNGR accumulation was observed in both primary 
malignancies and metastases. However, a steadily increased accumulation of 
[18F]FDG, 68Ga-NODAGA-RGD, and 68Ga-NOTA-cNGR was observed in the tumors growing 
under the renal capsule and in the metastatic parathymic lymph nodes during 
serial transplantations. The observed increase in 68Ga- NOTA-cNGR accumulation 
during serial transplantations correlated well with the western blot analysis, 
where APN/CD13 protein levels were also elevated in the metastatic parathymic 
lymph nodes.
CONCLUSION: The observed increase in glucose metabolism and the up-regulated 
expression of αvß3 integrin and APN/CD13 during serial transplantations of 
metastases may indicate enhanced malignancy.

Weiss-Ottolenghi Y(1), Amit S(3)(8), Asraf K(9), Joseph G(1), Levin T(7), 
Kanaaneh Y(7), Aydenzon A(7), Canetti M(1)(3), Freedman L(10), Zuckerman N(7), 
Mendelson E(3)(7), Doolman R(9), Kreiss Y(3)(11), Regev-Yochay G(1)(2)(3), 
Lustig Y(3)(7).

IMPORTANCE: A correlation between antibody levels and risk of infection has been 
demonstrated for the wild-type, Alpha, and Delta SARS-COV-2 variants. High rates 
of breakthrough infections by the Omicron variant emphasized the need to 
investigate whether the humoral response elicited by mRNA vaccines is also 
associated with reduced risk of Omicron infection and disease.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the high antibody levels in individuals who 
have received at least 3 doses of an mRNA vaccine are associated with reduced 
risk of Omicron infection and disease.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective cohort study used serial 
real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and serological test data from 
January and May 2022 to assess the association of preinfection immunoglobin G 
(IgG) and neutralizing antibody titers with incidence of Omicron variant 
infection, incidence of symptomatic disease, and infectivity. Participants 
included health care workers who had received 3 or 4 doses of an mRNA COVID-19 
vaccine. Data were analyzed from May to August 2022.
EXPOSURES: Levels of SARS-CoV-2 anti-receptor binding domain IgG and 
neutralizing antibodies.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcomes were incidence of Omicron 
infection, incidence of symptomatic disease, and infectivity. Outcomes were 
measured using SARS-COV-2 PCR and antigen testing and daily online surveys 
regarding symptomatic disease.
RESULTS: This study included 3 cohorts for 3 different analyses: 2310 
participants were included in the protection from infection analysis (4689 
exposure events; median [IQR] age, 50 [40-60] years; 3590 [76.6%] among female 
health care workers), 667 participants (median [IQR] age, 46.28 (37.44,54.8); 
516 [77.4%] female) in the symptomatic disease analysis, and 532 participants 
(median [IQR] age, 48 [39-56] years; 403 [75.8%] female) in the infectivity 
analysis. Lower odds of infection were observed for each 10-fold increase in 
preinfection IgG (odds ratio [OR], 0.71; 95% CI, 0.56-0.90) and for each 2-fold 
increase in neutralizing antibody titers (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.83-0.95). The odds 
of substantial symptomatic disease were reduced for each 10-fold increase in IgG 
levels (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.29-0.78) and for each 2-fold increase in 
neutralizing antibodies levels (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76-0.96). Infectivity, 
assessed by mean cycle threshold value, was not significantly decreased with 
increasing IgG or neutralizing antibodies titers.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of vaccinated health care 
workers, IgG and neutralizing antibody titer levels were associated with 
protection against infection with the Omicron variant and against symptomatic 
disease.

Neutralization activity of sera/IgG preparations from fully BNT162b2 vaccinated 
individuals against SARS-CoV-2 Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Kappa variants.

Amano M(1)(2), Otsu S(1), Maeda K(2), Uemura Y(3), Shimizu Y(3), Omata K(3), 
Matsuoka M(1), Shimada S(4), Mitsuya H(5)(6)(7).

In the present prospective study, 225 individuals in Kumamoto General Hospital, 
Japan, who received two-doses of BNT162b2 vaccine were enrolled/followed up over 
150 days and neutralizing activity (NT50) of their sera and antiviral activity 
(EC50) of IgG purified from sera on day-60 post-1st-dose were determined against 
wild-type SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2Wuhan) (n = 211) and 9 variants (Alpha, Beta, 
Gamma, Delta, and Kappa) (n = 45). Time-dependent changes of IgG-activity 
(n = 25) against SARS-CoV-2Wuhan and variants were also examined. Day-60 sera 
showed reduced NT50 by more than 50% against all variants examined, and greatest 
reduction was seen with Beta. IgG fractions of high-responders and 
moderate-responders showed similar fold-changes in EC50 against each variant 
compared to SARS-CoV-2Wuhan. Evaluation of EC50 of IgG obtained at different 
time-points (day-28 to -150) revealed time-dependent reduction of activity 
against all variants. However, against Delta, relatively long-lasting favorable 
antiviral activity (at least 150 days) was observed. Our data strongly suggest 
that the successful antecedent scale-up of mRNA-based vaccine administrations in 
Japan was the primary contributor to the lessening of the otherwise more 
devastating SARS-CoV-2 pandemic wave caused by the Delta variant. The present 
data that the effectiveness of vaccine against the then-dominant SARS-CoV-2 
variant was likely associated with the moderation of the COVID-19 pandemic wave 
suggest that as in the case of influenza vaccines, the development of 
multivalent mRNA-based vaccines represent a generalizable approach to 
pre-emptively respond pandemic with mutable pathogens.

Prognostic model of immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with anti-angiogenic 
agents in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

Li X(1), Sun W(1), Ding X(1), Li W(1), Chen J(1).

BACKGROUND: The combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and 
anti-angiogenic agents has shown promising efficacy in unresectable 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but until now no clinical prognostic models or 
predictive biomarkers have been established.
METHODS: From 2016 to 2021, a total of 258 HCCs treated with ICIs and tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors (TKIs) were retrospectively enrolled, as the study cohort. 
Patients' baseline data was extracted by least absolute and shrinkage selection 
operator (LASSO) and Cox regression. Finally, a prognostic model in the form of 
nomogram was developed. Model performance was assessed in terms of 
discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility. A 5-fold cross-validation was 
used to evaluate the internal repeatability of the model. In addition, the 
patient cohort was divided into three subgroups according to nomogram scores. 
Their survivals were estimated by Kaplan-Meier methods and the differences were 
analyzed using log-rank tests.
RESULTS: Seven clinical parameters were selected: Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group performance status (ECOG PS), combination of transarterial 
chemoembolization (TACE), extrahepatic metastasis (EHM), platelet to lymphocyte 
ratio (PLR), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and 
Child-Pugh score. The model had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.777 at 1 year 
and 0.772 at 2 years. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration 
curve and decision curve analysis (DCA) showed that the discrimination, 
consistency and applicability of the model were good. In addition, 
cross-validation validated the discrimination of the model, and the C index 
value of the model is 0.7405. The median overall survival (OS) of the high-, 
medium- and low-risk subgroups was 7.58, 17.50 and 53.17 months, respectively, 
with a significant difference between the groups (P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: We developed a comprehensive and simple prognostic model for the

Roux-en-Y gastric bypass alters intestinal glucose transport in the obese Zucker 
rat.

Meng Q(1), Culnan DM(2), Ahmed T(1), Sun M(3), Cooney RN(1).

INTRODUCTION: The gastrointestinal tract plays a major role in regulating 
glucose homeostasis and gut endocrine function. The current study examines the 
effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) on intestinal GLP-1, glucose 
transporter expression and function in the obese Zucker rat (ZR).
METHODS: Two groups of ZRs were studied: RYGB and sham surgery pair-fed (PF) fed 
rats. Body weight and food intake were measured daily. On post-operative day 
(POD) 21, an oral glucose test (OGT) was performed, basal and 30-minute plasma, 
portal venous glucose and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels were measured. 
In separate ZRs, the biliopancreatic, Roux limb (Roux) and common channel (CC) 
intestinal segments were harvested on POD 21.
RESULTS: Body weight was decreased in the RYGB group. Basal and 30-minute OGT 
plasma and portal glucose levels were decreased after RYGB. Basal plasma GLP-1 
levels were similar, while a 4.5-fold increase in GLP-1 level was observed in 
30-minute after RYGB (vs. PF). The increase in basal and 30-minute portal venous 
GLP-1 levels after RYGB were accompanied by increased mRNA expressions of 
proglucagon and PC 1/3, GPR119 protein in the Roux and CC segments. mRNA and 
protein levels of FFAR2/3 were increased in Roux segment. RYGB decreased brush 
border glucose transport, transporter proteins (SGLT1 and GLUT2) and mRNA levels 
of Tas1R1/Tas1R3 and α-gustducin in the Roux and CC segments.
CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in intestinal glucose transport and enhanced 
post-prandial GLP-1 release were associated with increases in GRP119 and FFAR2/3 
after RYGB in the ZR model. Post-RYGB reductions in the regulation of intestinal 
glucose transport and L cell receptors regulating GLP-1 secretion represent 
potential mechanisms for improved glycemic control.

insulin for treatment of diabetes using in vitro assays and rat and mouse 
models.

Roed NK(5).

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Normalisation of blood glucose in individuals with diabetes is 
recommended to reduce development of diabetic complications. However, risk of 
severe hypoglycaemia with intensive insulin therapy is a major obstacle that 
prevents many individuals with diabetes from obtaining the recommended reduction 
in HbA1c. Inhibition of glucagon receptor signalling and liver-preferential 
insulin action have been shown individually to have beneficial effects in 
preclinical models and individuals with diabetes (i.e. improved glycaemic 
control), but also have effects that are potential safety risks (i.e. alpha cell 
hyperplasia in response to glucagon receptor antagonists and increased levels of 
liver triacylglycerols and plasma alanine aminotransferase activity in response 
to glucagon receptor antagonists and liver-preferential insulin). We 
hypothesised that a combination of glucagon inhibition and liver-preferential 
insulin action in a dual-acting molecule would widen the therapeutic window. By 
correcting two pathogenic mechanisms (dysregulated glucagon signalling and 
non-physiological distribution of conventional insulin administered s.c.), we 
hypothesised that lower doses of each component would be required to obtain 
sufficient reduction of hyperglycaemia, and that the undesirable effects that 
have previously been observed for monotreatment with glucagon antagonists and 
liver-preferential insulin could be avoided.
METHODS: A dual-acting glucagon receptor inhibitor and liver-preferential 
insulin molecule was designed and tested in rodent models (normal rats, rats 
with streptozotocin-induced hyperglycaemia, db/db mice and mice with 
diet-induced obesity and streptozotocin-induced hyperglycaemia), allowing 
detailed characterisation of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties 
of the dual-acting molecule and relevant control compounds, as well as 
exploration of how the dual-acting molecule influenced glucagon-induced recovery 
and spontaneous recovery from acute hypoglycaemia.
RESULTS: This molecule normalised blood glucose in diabetic models, and was 
markedly less prone to induce hypoglycaemia than conventional insulin treatment 
(approximately 4.6-fold less potent under hypoglycaemic conditions than under 
normoglycaemic conditions). However, compared to treatment with conventional 
long-acting insulin, this dual-acting molecule also increased triacylglycerol 
levels in the liver (approximately 60%), plasma alanine aminotransferase levels 
(approximately twofold) and alpha cell mass (approximately twofold).
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: While the dual-acting glucagon receptor inhibitor 
and liver-preferential insulin molecule showed markedly improved regulation of 
blood glucose, effects that are potential safety concerns persisted in the 
pharmacologically relevant dose range.

Vitamins and their derivatives synergistically promote hair shaft elongation ex 
vivo via PlGF/VEGFR-1 signalling activation.

Hu L(1), Kimura S(2), Haga M(1), Kashiwagi S(1), Takagi K(1), Shimizu T(1), 
Ishii T(1), Ohyama M(3).

BACKGROUND: Although vitamins or their derivatives (Vits), such as panthenyl 
ethyl ether, tocopherol acetate, and pyridoxine, have been widely used in 
topical hair care products, their efficacy and mode of action have been 
insufficiently studied.
OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the biological influence of Vits on hair follicles and 
determine the underlying mechanisms.
METHODS: A mouse vibrissa hair follicle organ culture model was utilized to 
evaluate the effects of Vits on hair shaft elongation. Gene and protein 
expression analyses and histological investigations were conducted to elucidate 
the responsible mechanisms. A human hair follicle cell culture was used to 
assess the clinical relevance.
RESULTS: In organ culture models, the combination of panthenyl ethyl ether, 
tocopherol acetate, and pyridoxine (namely, PPT) supplementation significantly 
promoted hair shaft elongation. PPT treatment enhanced hair matrix cell 
proliferation by 1.9-fold compared to controls, as demonstrated by Ki67-positive 
immunoreactivity. PPT-treated mouse dermal papillae exhibited upregulated 
Placental growth factor (Plgf) by 1.6-fold compared to controls. Importantly, 
the addition of PlGF neutralizing antibodies to the ex vivo culture diminished 
the promotive effect on hair growth and increase in VEGFR-1 phosphorylation 
achieved by PPT. A VEGFR-1 inhibitor also inhibited the promotion of hair 
growth. Microarray analysis suggested synergistic summation of individual Vits' 
bioactivity, putatively explaining the effect of PPT. Moreover, PPT increased 
PlGF secretion in cultured human dermal papilla cells.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that PPT promoted hair shaft elongation by 
activating PlGF/VEGFR-1 signalling. The current study can shed light on the 
previously underrepresented advantage of utilizing Vits in hair care products.

Activity and Crystal Structure of the Adherent-Invasive Escherichia coli 
Tle3/Tli3 T6SS Effector/Immunity Complex Determined Using an AlphaFold2 
Predicted Model.

Cascales E(2), Roussel A(1)(2), Canaan S(2), Journet L(2), Cambillau C(1)(3)(4).

The type VI secretion system (T6SS) delivers enzymatic effectors into target 
cells to destroy them. Cells of the same strain protect themselves against 
effectors with immunity proteins that specifically inhibit effectors. Here, we 
report the identification and characterization of a Tle3 phospholipase effector 
and its cognate immunity protein Tli3-an outer membrane lipoprotein from 
adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC). Enzymatic assays demonstrate that 
purified Tle3AIEC has a phospholipase A1, and not A2, activity and that its 
toxicity is neutralized by the cognate immunity protein Tli3AIEC. Tli3AIEC binds 
Tle3 in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio. Tle3AIEC, Tli3AIEC and the Tle3AIEC-Tli3AIEC 
complex were purified and subjected to crystallization. The Tle3AIEC-Tli3AIEC 
complex structure could not be solved by SeMet phasing, but only by molecular 
replacement when using an AlphaFold2 prediction model. Tle3AIEC exhibits an 
α/β-hydrolase fold decorated by two protruding segments, including a N-terminus 
loop. Tli3AIEC displays a new fold of three stacked β-sheets and a protruding 
loop that inserts in Tle3AIECcatalytic crevice. We showed, experimentally, that 
Tle3AIEC interacts with the VgrG AIEC cargo protein and AlphaFold2 prediction of 
the VgrGAIEC-Tle3AIEC complex reveals a strong interaction between the VgrGAIEC 
C-terminus adaptor and Tle3AIEC N-terminal loop.

Increased Mercury and Reduced Insect Diversity in Linked Stream-Riparian Food 
Webs Downstream of a Historical Mercury Mine.

Kraus JM(1), Holloway JM(2), Pribil MJ(2), McGee BN(2), Stricker CA(3), 
Rutherford DL(2), Todd AS(4).

Historical mining left a legacy of abandoned mines and waste rock in remote 
headwaters of major river systems in the western United States. Understanding 
the influence of these legacy mines on culturally and ecologically important 
downstream ecosystems is not always straightforward because of elevated natural 
levels of mineralization in mining-impacted watersheds. To test the ecological 
effects of historic mining in the headwaters of the upper Salmon River watershed 
in Idaho (USA), we measured multiple community and chemical endpoints in 
downstream linked aquatic-terrestrial food webs. Mining inputs impacted 
downstream food webs through increased mercury accumulation and decreased insect 
biodiversity. Total mercury (THg) in seston, aquatic insect larvae, adult 
aquatic insects, riparian spiders, and fish at sites up to 7.6 km downstream of 
mining was found at much higher concentrations (1.3-11.3-fold) and was 
isotopically distinct compared with sites immediately upstream of mining inputs. 
Methylmercury concentrations in bull trout and riparian spiders were 
sufficiently high (732-918 and 347-1140 ng MeHg g-1  dry wt, respectively) to 
affect humans, birds, and piscivorous fish. Furthermore, the alpha-diversity of 
benthic insects was locally depressed by 12%-20% within 4.3-5.7 km downstream 
from the mine. However, because total insect biomass was not affected by mine 
inputs, the mass of mercury in benthic insects at a site (i.e., ng Hg m-2 ) was 
extremely elevated downstream (10-1778-fold) compared with directly upstream of 
mining inputs. Downstream adult aquatic insect-mediated fluxes of THg were also 
high (~16 ng THg m-2  day-1 ). Abandoned mines can have ecologically important 
effects on downstream communities, including reduced biodiversity and increased 
mercury flux to higher order consumers, including fish, birds, and humans.

Evaluating the effectiveness of lockdowns and restrictions during SARS-CoV-2 
variant waves in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia.

P(1)(2)(3), Toloue Ostadgavahi A(1)(2)(3), Kelvin DJ(1)(2)(3).

INTRODUCTION: After the initial onset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the government 
of Canada and provincial health authorities imposed restrictive policies to 
limit virus transmission and mitigate disease burden. In this study, the 
pandemic implications in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia (NS) were 
evaluated as a function of the movement of people and governmental restrictions 
during successive SARS-CoV-2 variant waves (i.e., Alpha through Omicron).
METHODS: Publicly available data obtained from community mobility reports 
(Google), the Bank of Canada Stringency Index, the "COVID-19 Tracker" service, 
including cases, hospitalizations, deaths, and vaccines, population mobility 
trends, and governmental response data were used to relate the effectiveness of 
policies in controlling movement and containing multiple waves of SARS-CoV-2.
RESULTS: Our results indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic inflicted low burden 
in NS in the initial 2 years of the pandemic. In this period, we identified 
reduced mobility patterns in the population. We also observed a negative 
correlation between public transport (-0.78), workplace (-0.69), retail and 
recreation (-0.68) and governmental restrictions, indicating a tight 
governmental control of these movement patterns. During the initial 2 years, 
governmental restrictions were high and the movement of people low, 
characterizing a 'seek-and-destroy' approach. Following this phase, the highly 
transmissible Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant began circulating in NS at the end of 
the second year, leading to increased cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. 
During this Omicron period, unsustainable governmental restrictions and waning 
public adherence led to increased population mobility, despite increased 
transmissibility (26.41-fold increase) and lethality (9.62-fold increase) of the 
novel variant.
DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that the low initial burden caused by the 
SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was likely a result of enhanced restrictions to contain the 
movement of people and consequently, the spread of the disease. Easing public 
health restrictions (as measured by a decline in the BOC index) during periods 
of high transmissibility of circulating COVID-19 variants contributed to 
community spread, despite high levels of immunization in NS.

Proteomics and Phospho-Proteomics Profiling of the Co-Formulation of Type I and 
II Interferons, HeberFERON, in the Glioblastoma-Derived Cell Line U-87 MG.

S(4), Guirola O(4), Ramos Y(4), Wiśniewski JR(5), González LJ(4), Bello-Rivero 
I(6).

HeberFERON, a co-formulation of Interferon (IFN)-α2b and IFN-γ, has effects on 
skin cancer and other solid tumors. It has antiproliferative effects over 
glioblastoma multiform (GBM) clones and cultured cell lines, including U-87 MG. 
Here, we report the first label-free quantitative proteomic and 
phospho-proteomic analyses to evaluate changes induced by HeberFERON after 72 h 
incubation of U-87 MG that can explain the effect on cellular proliferation. 
LC-MS/MS, functional enrichment and networking analysis were performed. We 
identified 7627 proteins; 122 and 211 were down- and up-regulated by HeberFERON 
(fold change > 2; p < 0.05), respectively. We identified 23,549 peptides (5692 
proteins) and 8900 phospho-peptides; 523 of these phospho-peptides (359 
proteins) were differentially modified. Proteomic enrichment showed IFN 
signaling and its control, direct and indirect antiviral mechanisms were the 
main modulated processes. Phospho-proteome enrichment displayed the cell cycle 
as one of the most commonly targeted events together with cytoskeleton 
organization; translation/RNA splicing, autophagy and DNA repair, as represented 
biological processes. There is a high interconnection of phosphoproteins in a 
molecular network; mTOR occupies a centric hub with interactions with 
translation machinery, cytoskeleton and autophagy components. Novel phosphosites 
and others with unknown biological functionality in key players in the 
aforementioned processes were regulated by HeberFERON and involved CDK and ERK 
kinases. These findings open new experimental hypotheses regarding HeberFERON 
action. The results obtained contribute to a better understanding of HeberFERON 
effector mechanisms in the context of GBM treatment.

Labetalol in Healthy and Diseased Populations.

Labetalol is a drug that exhibits both alpha and beta-adrenergic 
receptor-blocking properties. The American Heart Association/American Stroke 
Association (AHA/ASA) has recommended labetalol as an initial treatment option 
for the management of severe hypertension. The physiologically based 
pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model is an in silico approach to determining the 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of a drug by incorporating blood flow and tissue 
composition of the organs. This study was conducted to evaluate the primary 
reasons for the difference in PK after intravenous (IV) and oral administration 
in healthy and diseased (renal and hepatic) populations. A comprehensive 
literature search was done using two databases, PubMed and Google Scholar. 
Various PK parameters were screened for the development of the PBPK model 
utilizing a population-based PK-Sim simulator. Simulations were performed after 
creating building blocks firstly in healthy individuals and then in diseased 
patients after IV and oral administration. The disposition of labetalol after IV 
and oral administration occurring in patients with the hepatic and renal disease 
was predicted. The model was evaluated by calculating the Robs/pred ratio and 
average fold error (AFE), which was in the two-fold error range. Moreover, 
Box-whisker plots were made to compare the overall concentration of the drug in 
the body at various stages of disease severity. The presented model provides 
useful quantitative estimates of drug dosing in patients fighting against severe 
chronic diseases.

A 33-residue peptide tag increases solubility and stability of Escherichia coli 
produced single-chain antibody fragments.

Q(4), Sun L(4), Chen Z(4), Yuan Z(1), Luo C(2)(5), Chen S(6), Tong S(1), Nassal 
M(7), Wen YM(1), Wang YX(8).

Single-chain variable fragments (scFvs), composed of variable domains of heavy 
and light chains of an antibody joined by a linker, share antigen binding 
capacity with their parental antibody. Due to intrinsically low solubility and 
stability, only two Escherichia coli-produced scFvs have been approved for 
therapy. Here we report that a 33-residue peptide, termed P17 tag, increases the 
solubility of multiple scFvs produced in Escherichia coli SHuffle strain by up 
to 11.6 fold. Hydrophilic sequence, especially charged residues, but not the 
predicted α-helical secondary structure of P17 tag, contribute to the solubility 
enhancement. Notably, the P17 tag elevates the thermostability of scFv as 
efficiently as intra-domain disulfide bonds. Moreover, a P17-tagged scFv 
targeting hepatitis B virus surface proteins shows over two-fold higher 
antigen-binding affinity and virus-neutralizing activity than the untagged 
version. These data strongly suggest a type I intramolecular chaperone-like 
activity of the P17 tag. Hence, the P17 tag could benefit the research, 
production, and application of scFv.

Manganese Modulates Metabolic Activity and Redox Homeostasis in Translationally 
Blocked Lactococcus cremoris, Impacting Metabolic Persistence, Cell 
Culturability, and Flavor Formation.

Nugroho ADW(1)(2)(3), van Olst B(1)(3)(4), Bachtiar SA(1)(2)(3), Boeren S(1)(4), 
Kleerebezem M(1)(3), Bachmann H(1)(2)(5).

Manganese (Mn) is an essential trace element that is supplemented in microbial 
media with varying benefits across species and growth conditions. We found that 
growth of Lactococcus cremoris was unaffected by manganese omission from the 
growth medium. The main proteome adaptation to manganese omission involved 
increased manganese transporter production (up to 2,000-fold), while the 
remaining 10 significant proteome changes were between 1.4- and 4-fold. Further 
investigation in translationally blocked (TB), nongrowing cells showed that Mn 
supplementation (20 μM) led to approximately 1.5 X faster acidification compared 
with Mn-free conditions. However, this faster acidification stagnated within 
24 h, likely due to draining of intracellular NADH that coincides with 
substantial loss of culturability. Conversely, without manganese, nongrowing 
cells persisted to acidify for weeks, albeit at a reduced rate, but maintaining 
redox balance and culturability. Strikingly, despite being unculturable, α-keto 
acid-derived aldehydes continued to accumulate in cells incubated in the 
presence of manganese, whereas without manganese cells predominantly formed the 
corresponding alcohols. This is most likely reflecting NADH availability for the 
alcohol dehydrogenase-catalyzed conversion. Overall, manganese influences the 
lactococcal acidification rate, and flavor formation capacity in a redox 
dependent manner. These are important industrial traits especially during cheese 
ripening, where cells are in a non-growing, often unculturable state. IMPORTANCE 
In nature as well as in various biotechnology applications, microorganisms are 
often in a nongrowing state and their metabolic persistence determines cell 
survival and functionality. Industrial examples are dairy fermentations where 
bacteria remain active during the ripening phases that can take up to months and 
even years. Here we investigated environmental factors that can influence 
lactococcal metabolic persistence throughout such prolonged periods. We found 
that in the absence of manganese, acidification of nongrowing cells remained 
active for weeks while in the presence of manganese it stopped within 1 day. The 
latter coincided with the accumulation of amino acid derived volatile 
metabolites. Based on metabolic conversions, proteome analysis, and a reporter 
assay, we demonstrated that the manganese elicited effects were NADH dependent. 
Overall the results show the effect of environmental modulation on prolonged 
cell-based catalysis, which is highly relevant to non-growing cells in nature 
and biotechnological applications.

Evolutionary Engineering of a Cp*Rh(III) Complex-Linked Artificial Metalloenzyme 
with a Chimeric β-Barrel Protein Scaffold.

Kato S(1), Onoda A(1), Schwaneberg U(2), Hayashi T(1).

Evolutionary engineering of our previously reported Cp*Rh(III)-linked artificial 
metalloenzyme was performed based on a DNA recombination strategy to improve its 
catalytic activity toward C(sp2)-H bond functionalization. Improved scaffold 
design was achieved with α-helical cap domains of fatty acid binding protein 
(FABP) embedded within the β-barrel structure of nitrobindin (NB) as a chimeric 
protein scaffold for the artificial metalloenzyme. After optimization of the 
amino acid sequence by directed evolution methodology, an engineered variant, 
designated NBHLH1(Y119A/G149P) with enhanced performance and enhanced stability 
was obtained. Additional rounds of metalloenzyme evolution provided a 
Cp*Rh(III)-linked NBHLH1(Y119A/G149P) variant with a >35-fold increase in 
catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) for cycloaddition of oxime and alkyne. Kinetic 
studies and MD simulations revealed that aromatic amino acid residues in the 
confined active-site form a hydrophobic core which binds to aromatic substrates 
adjacent to the Cp*Rh(III) complex. The metalloenzyme engineering process based 
on this DNA recombination strategy will serve as a powerful method for extensive 
optimization of the active-sites of artificial metalloenzymes.

Structural features, intrinsic disorder, and modularity of a pyriform spidroin 1 
core repetitive domain.

Simmons JR(1), Gasmi-Seabrook G(2), Rainey JK(1)(3)(4).

Orb-weaving spiders produce up to seven silk types, each with distinct 
biological roles, protein compositions, and mechanics. Pyriform (or piriform) 
silk is composed of pyriform spidroin 1 (PySp1) and is the fibrillar component 
of attachment discs that attach webs to substrates and to each other. Here, we 
characterize the 234-residue repeat unit (the "Py unit") from the core 
repetitive domain of Argiope argentata PySp1. Solution-state nuclear magnetic 
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy-based backbone chemical shift and dynamics analysis 
demonstrate a structured core flanked by disordered tails, structuring that is 
maintained in a tandem protein of two connected Py units, indicative of 
structural modularity of the Py unit in the context of the repetitive domain. 
Notably, AlphaFold2 predicts the Py unit structure with low confidence, echoing 
low confidence and poor agreement to the NMR-derived structure for the Argiope 
trifasciata aciniform spidroin (AcSp1) repeat unit. Rational truncation, 
validated through NMR spectroscopy, provided a 144-residue construct retaining 
the Py unit core fold, enabling near-complete backbone and side chain 1H, 13C, 
and 15N resonance assignment. A six α-helix globular core is inferred, flanked 
by regions of intrinsic disorder that would link helical bundles in tandem 
repeat proteins in a beads-on-a-string architecture.

Crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of the plant-specific 
microtubule-associated protein Spiral2.

Ohno M(1), Higuchi Y(1), Hayashi I(1).

Plant cells form microtubule arrays, called `cortical microtubules', beneath the 
plasma membrane which are critical for cell-wall organization and directional 
cell growth. Cortical microtubules are nucleated independently of centrosomes. 
Spiral2 is a land-plant-specific microtubule minus-end-targeting protein that 
stabilizes the minus ends by inhibiting depolymerization of the filament. 
Spiral2 possesses an N-terminal microtubule-binding domain and a conserved 
C-terminal domain whose function is unknown. In this study, the crystal 
structure of the conserved C-terminal domain of Spiral2 was determined using the 
single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method. Refinement of the model to a 
resolution of 2.2 Å revealed a helix-turn-helix fold with seven α-helices. The 
protein crystallized as a dimer, but SEC-MALS analysis showed the protein to be 
monomeric. A structural homology search revealed that the protein has similarity 
to the C-terminal domain of the katanin regulatory subunit p80. The structure 
presented here suggests that the C-terminal domain of Spiral2 represents a new 
class of microtubule dynamics modulator across the kingdom.

Characterization of two rice GH18 chitinases belonging to family 8 of plant 
pathogenesis-related proteins.

Tanaka J(1), Takashima T(1), Abe N(1), Fukamizo T(1), Numata T(2), Ohnuma T(3).

Two rice GH18 chitinases, Oschib1 and Oschib2, belonging to family 8 of plant 
pathogenesis-related proteins (PR proteins) were expressed, purified, and 
characterized. These enzymes, which have the structural features of class IIIb 
chitinases, preferentially cleaved the second glycosidic linkage from the 
non-reducing end of substrate chitin oligosaccharides as opposed to rice class 
IIIa enzymes, OsChib3a and OsChib3b, which mainly cleaved the fourth linkage 
from the non-reducing end of chitin hexasaccharide [(GlcNAc)6]. Oschib1 and 
Oschiab2 inhibited the growth of Fusarium solani, but showed only a weak or no 
antifungal activity against Aspergillus niger and Trichoderma viride on the agar 
plates. Structural analysis of Oschib1 and Oschib2 revealed that these enzymes 
have two large loops extruded from the (β/α)8 TIM-barrel fold, which are absent 
in the structures of class IIIa chitinases. The differences in the cleavage site 
preferences toward chitin oligosaccharides between plant class IIIa and IIIb 
chitinases are likely attributed to the additional loop structures found in the 
IIIb enzymes. The class IIIb chitinases, Oschib1 and Oschib2, seem to play

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Glutamine synthetase (GLUL), the sole generator of 
glutamine, is a metabolic nexus molecule also involved in atherosclerosis. We 
recently demonstrated a 2.2-fold upregulation of GLUL mRNA in stroke-causing 
carotid plaques when compared with plaques from asymptomatic patients. Here we 
compared in the same cohort GLUL mRNA expression with plaque gross morphology, 
and the colocalization of immunodetectable GLUL protein with histopathological 
changes and molecular and mechanical mediators linked to plaque development.
METHODS: Endarterectomy specimens from 19 asymptomatic and 24 stroke patients 
were sectioned longitudinally and immunostained for GLUL, CD68, α-smooth muscle 
actin, iron, heme oxygenase-1 and CD163, and graded semiquantitatively in every 
1 mm2. The amounts of cholesterol clefts and erythrocytes were graded. The 
fibrous cap thickness within each 1 mm2 area was measured. The association 
between the local pathological findings was analyzed by a hierarchical mixed 
modelling approach.
RESULTS: The previously found correlation between GLUL mRNA and clinical 
symptomatology was supported by the increased GLUL mRNA in diseased tissue and 
increased local GLUL immunoreactivity in areas with multiple different 
atherosclerotic changes. A longer symptom-to-operation time correlated with 
lower GLUL mRNA (Rs = -0.423, p=0.050) but few outliers had a significantly 
higher GLUL mRNA levels, which persisted throughout the post-symptomatic period. 
Plaque ulceration associated with 1.8-fold higher GLUL mRNA (p=0.006). 
Macrophages were the main GLUL immunoreactive cells. GLUL immunostaining 
colocalized with erythrocytes, iron, CD163, and heme oxygenase-1. The 
correlations between local variables were consistent in both asymptomatic and 
stroke-causing plaques. An inverse correlation was found between the fibrous cap 
thickness and local GLUL immunoreactivity (p=0.012). Considerable variability in 
interplaque expression pattern of GLUL was present.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results link connect macrophage GLUL expression with carotid 
plaque features characterizing plaque vulnerability.

An inclined detector geometry for improved X-ray total scattering measurements.

Burns N(1), Rahemtulla A(1)(2), Annett S(1), Moreno B(1)(2), Kycia S(1).

X-ray total scattering measurements are implemented using a digital flat-panel 
area detector in an inclined geometry and compared with the traditional 
geometry. The traditional geometry is defined here by the incident X-ray beam 
impinging on and normal to the center-most pixel of a detector. The inclined 
geometry is defined here by a detector at a pitch angle α, set to 15° in this 
case, bisected by the vertical scattering plane. The detector is positioned such 
that the incident X-ray beam strikes the pixels along the bottom edge and 90° 
scattered X-rays impinge on the pixels along the top edge. The geometric 
attributes of the inclined geometry translate into multiple benefits, such as an 
extension of the measurable scattering range to 90°, a 47% increase in the 
accessible magnitudes of the reciprocal-space vector Q and a leveling of the 
dynamic range in the measured total scattering pattern. As a result, a sixfold 
improvement in signal-to-noise ratios is observed at higher scattering angles, 
enabling up to a 36-fold reduction in acquisition time. Additionally, the extent 
of applied modification functions is reduced, decreasing the magnitude of 
termination ripples and improving the real-space resolution of the pair 
distribution function G(r). Taken all together, these factors indicate that the 
inclined geometry produces higher quality data than the traditional geometry, 
usable for simultaneous Rietveld refinement and total scattering studies.

Hypoxia-Triggered Bioreduction of Poly(N-oxide)-Drug Conjugates Enhances Tumor 
Penetration and Antitumor Efficacy.

Zhang L(1)(2)(3)(4), Sun J(1)(2)(3)(4)(5), Huang W(2), Zhang S(1)(2)(3)(4)(5), 
Deng X(1)(2), Gao W(1)(2)(3)(4)(5).

PEGylation prolongs the blood circulation time of drugs; however, it 
simultaneously reduces the tumor penetration of drugs due to the nonfouling 
function and bulky hydrodynamic volume of PEG, leading to unsatisfactory 
outcomes in the treatment of solid tumors. Herein, we report the in situ growth 
of a bioreducible polymer of poly(N-oxide) from an important protein drug of 
interferon alpha (IFN) to generate site-specific IFN-poly(N-oxide) conjugates 
with higher bioactivity than a clinically used PEGylated IFN of PEGASYS. An 
IFN-poly(N-oxide) conjugate is screened out to have a circulating half-life as 
long as 51 h, which is similar to that of PEGASYS but 96-fold greater than that 
of IFN. However, the conjugate greatly outperforms PEGASYS and IFN in tumor 
penetration and antitumor efficacy in mice bearing melanoma. This enhanced tumor 
penetration is ascribed to the adsorption-mediated transcytosis of the conjugate 
whose poly(N-oxide) is biologically reduced into poly(tertiary amine), under 
hypoxia, which can be further protonated in the acidic tumor microenvironment. 
These novel findings demonstrate that poly(N-oxide)s are not only 
long-circulating but also bioreducible under hypoxia and are of great promise as 
next-generation carriers to deliver drugs into the interior of solid tumors to 
enhance their antitumor efficacy.

Lipid/Clay-Based Solid Dispersion Formulation for Improving the Oral 
Bioavailability of Curcumin.

Song JG(1), Noh HM(1), Lee SH(1), Han HK(1).

This study was conducted to develop a lipid/clay-based solid dispersion (LSD) 
formulation to enhance the dissolution and oral bioavailability of poorly 
soluble curcumin. Krill oil and aminoclay were used as a lipid and a stabilizer, 
respectively, and LSD formulations of curcumin were prepared by an antisolvent 
precipitation method combined with freeze-drying process. Based on the 
dissolution profiles, the optimal composition of LSD was determined at the 
weight ratio of curcumin: krill oil: aminoclay of 1:5:5 in the presence of 0.5% 
of D-α-tocopherol polyethylene glycol succinate. The structural and 
morphological characteristics of the LSD formulation were determined using X-ray 
powder diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, and scanning electron 
microscopy. Crystalline curcumin was changed to an amorphous form in the LSD 
formulation. At the pH of acidic to neutral, the LSD formulation showed almost 
complete drug dissolution (>90%) within 1 h, while pure curcumin exhibited 
minimal dissolution of less than 10%. Furthermore, the LSD formulation had 
significantly improved oral absorption of curcumin in rats, where Cmax and AUC 
of curcumin were 13- and 23-fold higher for the LSD formulation than for the 
pure drug. Taken together, these findings suggest that the krill oil-based solid 
dispersion formulation of curcumin effectively improves the dissolution and oral 
bioavailability of curcumin.

Protein misfolding and related human diseases: A comprehensive review of 
toxicity, proteins involved, and current therapeutic strategies.

Khan AN(1), Khan RH(2).

Most of the cell's chemical reactions and structural components are facilitated 
by proteins. But proteins are highly dynamic molecules, where numerous 
modifications or changes in the cellular environment can affect their native 
conformational fold leading to protein aggregation. Various stress conditions, 
such as oxidative stress, mutations and metal toxicity may cause protein 
misfolding and aggregation by shifting the conformational equilibrium towards 
more aggregation-prone states. Most of the protein misfolding diseases (PMDs) 
involve aggregation of protein. We have discussed such proteins like Aβ peptide, 
α-synuclein, amylin and lysozyme involved in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, type II 
diabetes and non-neuropathic systemic amyloidosis respectively. Till date, all 
advances in PMDs therapeutics help symptomatically but do not prevent the root 
cause of the disease, i.e., the aggregation of protein involved in the diseases. 
Current efforts focused on developing therapies for PMDs have employed diverse 
strategies; repositioning pre-existing drugs as it saves time and money; natural 
compounds that are touted as potential drug candidates have an advantage of 
being taken in diet normally and will induce lesser side effects. This review 
also covers recently developed therapeutic strategies like antisense drugs and 
disaggregases which has yielded therapeutic agents that have transitioned from 
preclinical studies into human clinical trials.

Host-Guest Complexation by β-Cyclodextrin Enhances the Solubility of an 
Esterified Protein.

Cheah KM, Jun JV, Wittrup KD, Raines RT.

The carboxyl groups of a protein can be esterified by reaction with a diazo 
compound, 2-diazo-2-(p-methylphenyl)-N,N-dimethylacetamide. This esterification 
enables the entry of the protein into the cytosol of a mammalian cell, where the 
nascent ester groups are hydrolyzed by endogenous esterases. The low aqueous 
solubility of the ensuing esterified protein is, however, a major practical 
challenge. Solubility screening revealed that β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) is an 
optimal solubilizing agent for esterified green fluorescent protein (est-GFP). 
Its addition can increase the recovery of est-GFP by 10-fold. α-CD, γ-CD, and 
cucurbit-7-uril are less effective excipients. 1H NMR titration experiments 
revealed that β-CD encapsulates the hydrophobic tolyl group of ester conjugates 
with Ka = 321 M-1. Combining l-arginine and sucrose with β-CD enables the nearly 
quantitative recovery of est-GFP. Thus, the insolubility of esterified proteins 
can be overcome with excipients.

Complexation of Astatine(III) with Ketones: Roles of NO(3)(-) Counterion and 
Exploration of Possible Binding Modes.

Burns JD(1), Tereshatov EE(2), Zhang B(3), Tabacaru GC(2), McIntosh LA(2), 
Schultz SJ(2)(3), McCann LA(2)(3), Harvey BM(2)(4), Hannaman A(2)(3), Lofton 
KN(2)(3), Sorensen MQ(2)(3), Vonder Haar AL(2), Hall MB(3), Yennello SJ(2)(3).

Ketones have been proven effective in extracting astatine(III) from aqueous 
solvents. Previous theoretical studies suggested a mechanism where the "sp2" 
lone pair on the carbonyl oxygen donates electron density into the π system of 
the AtO+ molecular cation to form a dative-type bond. In this study, 
co-extraction of NO3- as AtO(NO3)·(O═CR1R2) species into the organic phase 
appears to be a key factor. Adjusting the electronic properties of the ketone, 
by having an aryl group instead of an alkyl group in the alpha position of the 
ketone, increased the electron density on C═O, increased the bond strength 
between the ketone and AtO+, and in turn increased the extraction of 211At into 
the organic phase. Extraction with diketones shows dependence on the bridging 
distance between the two carbonyl moieties, where a C3 or longer bridge results 
in a 10-fold increase in extraction into the organic phase. DFT calculations 
show the longer bridge allows for the chelation of AtO(NO3) by either the second 
carbonyl or the phenyl ring.

More than magnetic isolation: Dynabeads as strong Raman reporters towards 
simultaneous capture and identification of targets.

Lee J, McDonald M, Mhlanga N, Kang JW, Karnik R, Tadesse LF.

Dynabeads are superparamagnetic particles used for immunomagnetic purification 
of cells and biomolecules. Post-capture, however, target identification relies 
on tedious culturing, fluorescence staining and/or target amplification. Raman 
spectroscopy presents a rapid detection alternative, but current implementations 
target cells themselves with weak Raman signals. We present antibody-coated 
Dynabeads as strong Raman reporter labels whose effect can be considered a Raman 
parallel of immunofluorescent probes. Recent developments in techniques for 
separating target-bound Dynabeads from unbound Dynabeads makes such an 
implementation feasible. We deploy Dynabeads anti-Salmonella to bind and 
identify Salmonella enterica, a major foodborne pathogen. Dynabeads present 
signature peaks at 1000 and 1600 1/cm from aliphatic and aromatic C-C stretching 
of polystyrene, and 1350 1/cm and 1600 1/cm from amide, alpha-helix and 
beta-sheet of antibody coatings of the Fe2O3 core, confirmed with electron 
dispersive X-ray (EDX) imaging. Their Raman signature can be measured in dry and 
liquid samples even at single shot ~30 x 30-micrometer area imaging using 0.5 s, 
7 mW laser acquisition with single and clustered beads providing a 44- and 
68-fold larger Raman intensity compared to signature from cells. Higher 
polystyrene and antibody content in clusters yields to the larger signal 
intensity and conjugation to bacteria strengthens clustering as a bacterium can 
bind to more than one bead as observed via transmission electron microscopy 
(TEM). Our findings shed light on the intrinsic Raman reporter nature of 
Dynabeads, demonstrating their dual function for target isolation and detection 
without additional sample preparation, staining, or unique plasmonic substrate 
engineering, advancing their applications in heterogeneous samples like food, 
water, and blood.

Hydrogen Bonding Promotes Alcohol C-C Coupling.

Gao Z(1)(2), Mu J(1), Zhang J(1), Huang Z(1)(2), Lin X(3), Luo N(1), Wang F(1).

Photocatalytic C-C bond formation coupled with H2 production provides a 
sustainable approach to producing carbon-chain-prolonged chemicals and hydrogen 
energy. However, the involved radical intermediates with open-shell electronic 
structures are highly reactive, experiencing predominant oxidative or reductive 
side reactions in semiconductors. Herein, we demonstrate that hydrogen bonding 
on the catalyst surface and in the bulk solution can inhibit oxidation and 
reverse reaction of α-hydroxyethyl radicals (αHRs) in photocatalytic 
dehydrocoupling of ethanol over Au/CdS. Intentionally added water forms surface 
hydrogen bonds with adsorbed αHRs and strengthens the hydrogen bonding between 
αHRs and ethanol while maintaining the flexibility of radicals in solution, 
thereby allowing for αHRs' desorption from the Au/CdS surface and their 
stabilization by a solvent. The coupling rate of αHR increases by 2.4-fold, and 
the selectivity of the target product, 2,3-butanediol (BDO), increases from 37 
to 57%. This work manifests that nonchemical bonding interactions can steer the 
reaction paths of radicals for selective photocatalysis.

Estimating the way of deposition of saliva stains using quantitative analysis of 
forensic salivary biomarkers.

Ohta J(1), Minegishi S(2), Noda N(3), Sakurada K(2).

Analyzing the way of deposition of saliva stains contributes to appropriate 
interpretation of saliva as evidence in court, particularly in sexual assault 
cases. In this proof-of-concept study, we aimed to confirm the difference 
between drooling-derived (non-contact) saliva and licking-derived (contact) 
saliva and clarify whether objectively distinguishing between the two saliva is 
possible. To allow discrimination between these two samples, an indicator was 
devised where the relative Streptococcus salivarius DNA quantity was calculated 
by dividing the S. salivarius DNA copies by the amount of stained saliva from 
the same saliva sample using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and salivary 
α-amylase activity assays. The study findings reveal that the value of the 
proposed indicator of licking-derived saliva was 100-fold significantly greater 
than that of drooling-derived saliva (P < 0.05, Welch's t-test). However, 
theoretical and technical challenges preclude the application of this indicator 
as a practical method. We believe that this saliva-specific bacterial DNA-based 
approach could allow estimation of the saliva stain deposition method.

Female rats have a different healing phenotype than males after anterior 
cruciate ligament rupture with no intervention.

Morris JL(1), Letson HL(1), Biros E(1), McEwen PC(2), Dobson GP(1).

Little is known on the sex-specific healing responses after an anterior cruciate 
ligament (ACL) rupture. To address this, we compared male and female 
Sprague-Dawley rats following non-surgical ACL rupture. Hematology, 
inflammation, joint swelling, range of motion, and pain-sensitivity were 
analyzed at various times over 31-days. Healing was assessed by histopathology 
and gene expression changes in the ACL remnant and adjacent joint tissues. In 
the first few days, males and females showed similar functional responses after 
rupture, despite contrasting hematology and systemic inflammatory profiles. 
Sex-specific differences were found in inflammatory, immune and angiogenic 
potential in the synovial fluid. Histopathology and increased collagen and 
fibronectin gene expression revealed significant tissue remodeling in both 
sexes. In the ACL remnant, however, Acta2 gene expression (α-SMA production) was 
4-fold higher in males, with no change in females, indicating increased 
fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition with higher contractile elements 
(stiffness) in males. Females had 80% lower Pparg expression, which further 
suggests reduced cellular differentiation potential in females than males. Sex 
differences were also apparent in the infrapatellar fat pad and articular 
cartilage. We conclude females and males showed different patterns of healing 
post-ACL rupture over 31-days, which may impact timing of reconstruction 
surgery, and possibly clinical outcome.

Bioplastic degradation by a polyhydroxybutyrate depolymerase from a thermophilic 
soil bacterium.

Thomas GM(1), Quirk S(2), Huard DJE(1), Lieberman RL(1).

As the epidemic of single-use plastic worsens, it has become critical to 
identify fully renewable plastics such as those that can be degraded using 
enzymes. Here we describe the structure and biochemistry of an alkaline 
poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyric acid] (PHB) depolymerase from the soil thermophile 
Lihuaxuella thermophila. Like other PHB depolymerases or PHBases, the 
Lihuaxuella enzyme is active against several different polyhydroxyalkanoates, 
including homo- and heteropolymers, but L. thermophila PHB depolymerase 
(LtPHBase) is unique in that it also hydrolyzes polylactic acid and 
polycaprolactone. LtPHBase exhibits optimal activity at 70°C, and retains 88% of 
activity upon incubation at 65°C for 3 days. The 1.2 Å resolution crystal 
structure reveals an α/β-hydrolase fold typical of PHBases, but with a shallow 
active site containing the catalytic Ser-His-Asp-triad that appears poised for 
broad substrate specificity. LtPHBase holds promise for the depolymerization of 
PHB and related bioplastics at high temperature, as would be required in 
bioindustrial operations like recycling or landfill management.

A Comprehensive Review of Soluble Epoxide Hyådrolase Inhibitors Evaluating their 
Structure-Activity Relationship.

Nazari M(1), Rezaee E(1), Tabatabai SA(1).

Soluble epoxide hydrolase is a class of α/β-fold hydrolase enzymes that exist in 
numerous organs and tissues, including the liver, kidney, brain, and 
vasculature. This homodimer enzyme is responsible for degrading 
epoxyeicosatrienoic acids to the less active vicinal diols, 
dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids by adding a molecule of water to an epoxide in the 
cytochrome P450 pathway. Soluble epoxide hydrolase was firstly assayed and 
characterized by Hammock and colleagues about 40 years ago. Upholding high 
epoxyeicosatrienoic acid blood levels by inhibiting soluble epoxide hydrolase 
has been proposed as a hopeful strategy to treat renal and cardiovascular 
diseases, inflammation, and pain. Therefore, developing novel soluble epoxide 
hydrolase inhibitors has been an attractive research topic for many years. 
Regarding this issue, some carbamates, heterocycles, amides, and ureas have been 
proposed; however, rapid metabolism, low solubility, high melting point, and 
weak pharmacokinetic characteristics are challenges posed to the researchers. In 
this review, we have focused on the role of the soluble epoxide hydrolase in the 
metabolic pathway of arachidonic acid, and categorized the most representative 
soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors into two main classes of synthetic and 
natural compounds. The structures have been evaluated and an exemplary 
structure-activity relationship has been provided for further development of 
potent inhibitors at the end. According to our findings, urea-based inhibitors 
were preferred to the amide-based scaffolds due to the better fitting into the 
active site. An aromatic linker is a suitable bridge to connect primary and 
secondary pharmacophores compared with aliphatic linkers.

Preliminary proteomic analysis of human tears in lacrimal adenoid cystic 
carcinoma and pleomorphic adenoma.

Yue H(1)(2), Meng FX(1)(2), Zhang R(1)(2), Qian J(1)(2).

AIM: To detect proteomic differences in tears between adenoid cystic carcinoma 
(ACC) and pleomorphic adenoma (PA).
METHODS: Tear samples were collected from 4 patients with ACC, 5 with PA, and 4 
control cases. Label-free analysis and parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) were 
used to screen and validate the tear proteome. Gene Ontology (GO) annotation and 
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were conducted for bioinformatics 
analysis.
RESULTS: In total, 1059 proteins in tear samples were identified by label-free 
analysis. Between ACC and PA, 415 differentially expressed proteins were 
detected. Based on the GO annotation, enzyme regulator activity and serine-type 
endopeptidase inhibitor activity in the molecular function category, blood 
microparticle and extracellular matrix in the cellular component category, and 
response to nutrient levels in the biological process category were most 
predominant. By KEGG pathway annotation, the different proteins between ACC and 
PA mainly participated in complement and coagulation cascades, amoebiasis, 
African trypanosomiasis and cholesterol metabolism. Eight proteins with mostly 
significant differences were verified by PRM, and five proteins with more than 
10-fold increases in ACC compared with PA, including integrin β, 
α-2-macroglobulin, epididymal secretory sperm binding protein Li 78p, RAB5C, and 
complement C5, were identified.
CONCLUSION: The combined tools of label-free analysis and PRM are very effective 
and efficient, especially for samples such as tears. Some proteomic differences 
in tears between ACC and PA are identified and these protein candidates may be 
specific biomarkers for future exploration.

Percutaneous pedicle screw fixation without arthrodesis of 368 thoracolumbar 
fractures: long-term clinical and radiological outcomes in a single institution.

Trungu S(1)(2), Ricciardi L(3), Forcato S(4), Piazza A(3), D'Andrea G(5), Polli 
FM(6), Cimatti M(3), Frati A(7), Miscusi M(3), Raco A(3).

PURPOSE: Traumatic thoracolumbar (TL) fractures are the most common vertebral 
fractures. Although a consensus on the preferred treatment is missing, 
percutaneous pedicle screw fixation (PPSF) has been progressively accepted as 
treatment option, since it is related to lower soft tissues surgical-injury and 
perioperative complications rate. This study aims to evaluate the long-term 
clinical-radiological outcomes after PPSF for TL fractures at a single tertiary 
academic hospital.
METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study. Back pain was obtained at 
preoperative, postoperative and final follow-up using Visual Analog Scale. 
Patient-reported outcomes, the Oswestry Disability Index and the 36-Item Short 
Form, were obtained to asses disability during follow-up. Radiological measures 
included Cobb angle, mid-sagittal index, sagittal index (SI) and vertebral body 
height loss. A multivariate regression analysis on preoperative radiological 
features was performed to investigate independent risk factors for implant 
failure.
RESULTS: A total of 296 patients with 368 TL fractures met inclusion criteria. 
Mean follow-up was 124.3 months. The clinical and radiological parameters 
significantly improved from preoperative to last follow-up measurements. The 
multivariate analysis showed that Cobb angle (OR = 1.3, p < 0.001), SI 
(OR = 1.5, p < 0.001) and number of fractures (OR = 1.1, p = 0.05), were 
independent risk factors for implant failure. The overall complication rate was 
5.1%, while the reoperation rate for implant failure was 3.4%.
CONCLUSIONS: In our case series, PPSF for TL injuries demonstrated good 
long-term clinical-radiological outcomes, along with low complication and 
reoperation rates. Accordingly, PPSF could be considered as a valuable treatment 
option for neurologically intact patients with TL fractures. Additionally, in 
this cohort, number of fractures ≥ 2, Cobb angle ≥ 15° and sagittal index ≥ 21° 
were independent risk factors for implant failure.

In vitro physicochemical characterization of five root canal sealers and their 
influence on an ex vivo oral multi-species biofilm community.

Herzberg MC(2), Marciano MA(1), Lima BP(2).

AIM: To evaluate the physicochemical properties of five root canal sealers and 
assess their effect on an ex vivo dental plaque-derived polymicrobial community.
METHODOLOGY: Dental plaque-derived microbial communities were exposed to the 
sealers (AH Plus [AHP], GuttaFlow Bioseal [GFB], Endoseal MTA [ESM], Bio-C 
sealer [BCS] and BioRoot RCS [BRR]) for 3, 6 and 18 h. The sealers' effect on 
the biofilm biomass and metabolic activity was quantified using crystal violet 
(CV) staining and MTT assay, respectively. Biofilm community composition and 
morphology were assessed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), 16S 
rRNA sequencing and scanning electron microscopy. The 
ISO6876:2012 specifications were followed to determine the setting time, 
radiopacity, flowability and solubility. Obturated acrylic teeth were used to 
assess the sealers' effect on pH. Surface chemical characterization was 
performed using SEM with coupled energy-dispersive spectroscopy. Data normality 
was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. One-way anova and Tukey's tests were 
used to analyze data from setting time, radiopacity, flowability and solubility. 
Two-way anova and Dunnett's tests were used for the data analysis from CV, MTT 
and pH. 16S rRNA sequencing data were analyzed for alpha (Shannon index and Chao 
analysis) and beta diversity (Bray-Curtis dissimilarities). Differences in 
community composition were evaluated by analysis of similarity (p < .05).
RESULTS: The sealers significantly influenced microbial community composition 
and morphology. All sealers complied with ISO6876:2012 requirements for setting 
time, radiopacity and flowability. Although only AHP effectively reduced the 
biofilm biomass, all sealers, except BRR, reduced biofilm metabolic activity.
CONCLUSION: Despite adequate physical properties, none of the sealers tested 
prevented biofilm growth. Significant changes in community composition were 
observed. If observed in vivo, these changes could affect intracanal microbial 
survival, pathogenicity and treatment outcomes.

interleukin-2 receptor-α on T cell lymphomas.

Lee JH(1)(2), Jung KH(1)(2), Kim M(1)(2), Lee KH(1)(2).

INTRODUCTION: Positron emission tomography (PET) using radiolabeled Abs as 
imaging tracer is called immuno-PET. Immuno-PET can verify therapeutic Ab 
delivery and can noninvasively quantify global levels of target expression in 
tumors of living subjects. The interleukin-2 receptor α chain (IL-2Rα; CD25) is 
a promising target for immune therapy and radioimmunotherapy of lymphomas. 
Immuno-PET could facilitate this approach by visualizing CD25 expression in 
vivo.
METHODS: We prepared 89Zr-anti-CD25 IgG specifically labeled to sulfhydryl 
moieties by maleimide-deferoxamine conjugation.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: CD25(+) SUDHL1 human T-cell lymphoma cells showed high 
anti-human 89Zr-CD25 IgG binding that reached 32-fold of that of CD25(-) human 
lymphoma cells and was completely blocked by excess unlabeled Ab. In SUDHL1 
tumor-bearing nude mice, pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated exponential 
reductions of whole blood and plasma activity following intravenous 
89Zr-anti-CD25 IgG injection, with half-lives of 26.0 and 23.3 h, respectively. 
SUDHL1 tumor uptake of 89Zr-CD25 IgG was lower per weight in larger tumors, but 
blood activity did not correlate with tumor size or blood level of human CD25, 
indicating minimal influence by circulating soluble CD25 protein secreted from 
the lymphoma cells. 89Zr-CD25 IgG PET allowed high-contrast SUDHL1 lymphoma 
visualization at five days. Biodistribution studies confirmed high tumor 
89Zr-CD25 IgG uptake (8.7 ± 0.9%ID/g) that was greater than blood (5.2 ± 
1.6%ID/g) and organ uptakes (0.7 to 3.5%ID/g). Tumor CD25-specific targeting was 
confirmed by suppression of tumor uptake to 4.3 ± 0.2%ID by excess unlabeled 
CD25 IgG, as well as by low tumor uptake of 89Zr-labeled IgG2a isotype control 
Ab (3.6 ± 0.9%ID). Unlike CD25(+) lymphocytes from mouse thymus that showed 
specific uptake of anti-mouse 89Zr-CD25 IgG, EL4 mouse lymphoma cells had low 
CD25 expression and showed low uptake. In immunocompetent mice bearing EL4 
tumors, anti-mouse 89Zr-CD25 IgG displayed low uptakes in normal organs as well 
as in the tumor. Furthermore, the biodistribution was not influenced by Ab 
blocking, indicating that specific uptake in nontumor tissues was minimal. 
89Zr-CD25 IgG immuno-PET may thus be useful for imaging of T-cell lymphomas and 
noninvasive assessment of CD25 expression on target cells in vivo.

of Toxoplasma gondii: A Comparative Retrospective Study.

Accurate tools for Toxoplasma gondii detection and quantification can be 
valuable for the early and effective management of toxoplasmosis. Droplet 
digital PCR (ddPCR) is a next-generation end-point PCR technique with high 
performance. The objective of the study was to evaluate the performance of ddPCR 
for the detection and absolute quantification of T. gondii. From January 2019 to 
October 2020, DNA samples collected at the Laboratory of Parasitology and 
Mycology of Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris were retrospectively analyzed by 
ddPCR and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). To detect T. gondii with the best 
sensitivity possible, the REP-529 multicopy target was used. For absolute 
quantification of T. gondii, a specific single-copy target of α-tubulin was 
designed. T. gondii detection by ddPCR and qPCR was strongly correlated 
(R2 = 0.93), with a total concordance of 96.7% (n = 145/150). Quantification of 
T. gondii using ddPCR was successful for 15 of 35 samples showing a parasite 
load ≥170 copies/mL of DNA eluate using the α-tubulin target. The qPCR REP-529 
quantification based on a standard curve was approximate and dependent on the 
strain genotype, which led to an estimate of parasite copy number 14- to 
160-fold superior to the ddPCR result. In total, ddPCR is an effective molecular 
method for T. gondii detection that shows equivalent performance to qPCR. For 
robust T. gondii quantification, ddPCR is clearly more accurate than 
semiquantitative qPCR methods.

Soybean transporter AAT Rhg1 abundance increases along the nematode migration 
path and impacts vesiculation and ROS.

Han S(1)(2)(3), Smith JM(1), Du Y(1), Bent AF(1).

Rhg1 (Resistance to Heterodera glycines 1) mediates soybean (Glycine max) 
resistance to soybean cyst nematode (SCN; H. glycines). Rhg1 is a 4-gene, ∼30-kb 
block that exhibits copy number variation, and the common PI 88788-type rhg1-b 
haplotype carries 9 to 10 tandem Rhg1 repeats. Glyma.18G022400 (Rhg1-GmAAT), 1 
of 3 resistance-conferring genes at the complex Rhg1 locus, encodes the putative 
amino acid transporter AATRhg1 whose mode of action is largely unknown. We 
discovered that AATRhg1 protein abundance increases 7- to 15-fold throughout 
root cells along the migration path of SCN. These root cells develop an 
increased abundance of vesicles and large vesicle-like bodies (VLB) as well as 
multivesicular and paramural bodies. AATRhg1 protein is often present in these 
structures. AATRhg1 abundance remained low in syncytia (plant cells reprogrammed 
by SCN for feeding), unlike the Rhg1 α-SNAP protein, whose abundance has 
previously been shown to increase in syncytia. In Nicotiana benthamiana, if 
soybean AATRhg1 was present, oxidative stress promoted the formation of large 
VLB, many of which contained AATRhg1. AATRhg1 interacted with the soybean NADPH 
oxidase GmRBOHG, the ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana RBOHD previously found to 
exhibit upregulated expression upon SCN infection. AATRhg1 stimulated reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) generation when AATRhg1 and GmRBOHG were co-expressed. 
These findings suggest that AATRhg1 contributes to SCN resistance along the 
migration path as SCN invades the plant and does so, at least in part, by 
increasing ROS production. In light of previous findings about α-SNAPRhg1, this 
study also shows that different Rhg1 resistance proteins function via at least 2 
spatially and temporally separate modes of action.

Introduction of a SiFA Moiety into the D-Glutamate Chain of DOTA-PP-F11N Results 
in Radiohybrid-Based CCK-2R-Targeted Compounds with Improved Pharmacokinetics In 
Vivo.

Holzleitner N(1), Günther T(1), Beck R(1), Lapa C(2), Wester HJ(1).

In order to enable 18F- and 177Lu-labelling within the same molecule, we 
introduced a silicon-based fluoride acceptor (SiFA) into the hexa-D-glutamate 
chain of DOTA-PP-F11N. In addition, minigastrin analogues with a prolonged as 
well as γ-linked D-glutamate chain were synthesised and evaluated. CCK-2R 
affinity (IC50, AR42J cells) and lipophilicity (logD7.4) were determined. 
Biodistribution studies at 24 h post-injection (p.i.) and µSPECT/CT imaging at 
1, 4 and 24 h p.i. were carried out in AR42J tumour-bearing CB17-SCID mice. 
CCK-2R affinity of (R)-DOTAGA-rhCCK-1 to 18 was enhanced with increasing 
distance between the SiFA building block and the binding motif. Lipophilicity of 
[177Lu]Lu-(R)-DOTAGA-rhCCK-1 to 18 was higher compared to that of 
[177Lu]Lu-DOTA-PP-F11N and [177Lu]Lu-CP04. The respective α- and γ-linked rhCCK 
derivatives revealing the highest CCK-2R affinity were further evaluated in 
vivo. In comparison with [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-PP-F11N, [177Lu-]Lu-(R)-DOTAGA-rhCCK-9 
and -16 exhibited three- to eight-fold increased activity levels in the tumour 
at 24 h p.i. However, activity levels in the kidneys were elevated as well. We 
could show that the introduction of a lipophilic SiFA moiety into the 
hydrophilic backbone of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-PP-F11N led to a decelerated blood 
clearance and thus improved tumour retention. However, elevated kidney retention 
has to be addressed in future studies.

Insight into the pulmonary molecular toxicity of heated tobacco products using 
human bronchial and alveolar mucosa models at air-liquid interface.

Rahman M(1), Irmler M(2), Introna M(1), Beckers J(2)(3)(4), Palmberg L(1), 
Johanson G(1), Upadhyay S(#)(5), Ganguly K(#)(6).

Heated tobacco products (HTP) are novel nicotine delivery products with limited 
toxicological data. HTP uses heating instead of combustion to generate aerosol 
(HTP-smoke). Physiologically relevant human bronchial and alveolar lung mucosa 
models developed at air-liquid interface were exposed to HTP-smoke to assess 
broad toxicological response (n = 6-7; ISO puffing regimen; compared to sham; 
non-parametric statistical analysis; significance: p < 0.05). Elevated levels of 
total cellular reactive oxygen species, stress responsive nuclear factor 
kappa-B, and DNA damage markers [8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, phosphorylated 
histone H2AX, cleaved poly-(ADP-Ribose) polymerase] were detected in HTP-smoke 
exposed bronchial and/or alveolar models. RNA sequencing detected differential 
regulation of 724 genes in the bronchial- and 121 genes in the alveolar model 
following HTP-smoke exposure (cut off: p ≤ 0.01; fold change: ≥ 2). Common 
enriched pathways included estrogen biosynthesis, ferroptosis, superoxide 
radical degradation, xenobiotics, and α-tocopherol degradation. Secreted levels 
of interleukin (IL)1ꞵ and IL8 increased in the bronchial model whereas in the 
alveolar model, interferon-γ and IL4 increased and IL13 decreased following 
HTP-smoke exposure. Increased lipid peroxidation was detected in HTP-smoke 
exposed bronchial and alveolar models which was inhibited by ferrostatin-1. The 
findings form a basis to perform independent risk assessment studies on 
different flavours of HTP using different puffing topography and corresponding 
chemical characterization.

Development of a New DHFR-Based Destabilizing Domain with Enhanced Basal 
Turnover and Applicability in Mammalian Systems.

Nakahara E(1), Mullapudi V(2), Collier GE(1), Joachimiak LA(2)(3), Hulleman 
JD(1)(4).

Destabilizing domains (DDs) are an attractive strategy allowing for positive 
post-transcriptional small molecule-regulatable control of a fusion protein's 
abundance. However, in many instances, the currently available DDs suffer from 
higher-than-desirable basal levels of the fusion protein. Accordingly, we 
redesigned the E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (ecDHFR) DD by introducing a 
library of ∼1200 random ecDHFR mutants fused to YFP into CHO cells. Following 
successive rounds of fluorescence-activated cell sorting, we identified six new 
ecDHFR DD clones with significantly enhanced proteasomal turnover in the absence 
of a stabilizing ligand, trimethoprim (TMP). One of these clones, designated as 
"C12", contained four unique missense mutations (W74R/T113S/E120D/Q146L) and 
demonstrated a significant 2.9-fold reduction in basal levels compared to the 
conventional ecDHFR DD (i.e., R12Y/G67S/Y100I). This domain was similarly 
responsive to TMP with respect to dose response and maximal stabilization, 
indicating an overall enhanced dynamic range. Interestingly, both computational 
and wet-lab experiments identified the W74R and T113S mutations of C12 as the 
main contributors toward its basal destabilization. However, the combination of 
all the C12 mutations was required to maintain both its enhanced degradation and 
TMP stabilization. We further demonstrate the utility of C12 by fusing it to 
IκBα and Nrf2, two stress-responsive proteins that have previously been 
challenging to regulate. In both instances, C12 significantly enhanced the basal 
turnover of these proteins and improved the dynamic range of regulation post 
stabilizer addition. These advantageous features of the C12 ecDHFR DD variant 
highlight its potential for replacing the conventional N-terminal ecDHFR DD and 
improving the use of DDs overall, not only as a chemical biology tool but for 
gene therapy avenues as well.

structure: A pilot study.

Liu QH(1), Wang ZY(2), Tang JW(3), Mou JY(4), Ma ZW(5), Deng B(6), Liu Z(7), 
Wang L(8).

Molecular mechanisms behind structural alterations between fragile and stable 
glycogen α particles in liver are not clear yet. In this pilot study, we 
re-examined the diurnal alterations of glycogen structure from the perspective 
of liver tissue transcriptome. By comparing the structures of liver glycogen 
from mice at 12 am, 8 am, 12 pm, and 8 pm (light-on: 6 am; light-off: 6 pm), we 
re-confirmed that the liver glycogen was fragile at 12 am and 8 am and stable at 
12 pm and 8 pm as previously reported. The structural differences of glycogen 
particles at 12 am and 12 pm were thoroughly compared via transcriptomics. 
Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with statistical significance were 
identified, while expression level of the gene ppp1r3g 
(log2Fold_Change = -6.368, P-value = 2.89E-04) that encoded PPP1R3G with 
glycogen binding domain was most significantly changed, which provided 
preliminary clues to the structural alterations of glycogen α particles during 
the diurnal cycle.

Thermal energy and tableting effects in benznidazole product: the impacts of 
industrial processing.

Freitas-Marques MB(1)(2), Valle TSD(1), Araujo BCR(2), Sebastião RCO(2), Mussel 
WDN(2), Yoshida MI(2), Fernandes C(1).

OBJECTIVE: The investigation of benznidazole (BZN), excipients, and tablets aims 
to evaluate their thermal energy and tableting effects. They aim to understand 
better the molecular and pharmaceutical processing techniques of the 
formulation.
SIGNIFICANCE: The Product Quality Review, part of Good Manufacturing Practices, 
is essential to highlight trends and identify product and process improvements.
METHODS: A set of technique approaches, infrared spectroscopy, X-ray 
diffraction, and thermal analysis with isoconversional kinetic study, were 
applied in the protocol.
RESULTS: X-ray experiments suggest talc and α-lactose monohydrate dehydration 
and conversion of β-lactose to stable α-lactose upon tableting. The signal 
crystallization at 167 °C in the DSC curve confirmed this observation. A 
calorimetric study showed a decrease in the thermal stability of BZN tablets. 
Therefore, the temperature is a critical process parameter. The specific heat 
capacity (Cp) of BZN, measured by DSC, was 10.04 J/g at 25 °C and 9.06 J/g at 
160 °C. Thermal decomposition required 78 kJ mol-1. Compared with the tablet 
(about 200 kJ mol-1), the necessary energy is two-fold lower, as observed in the 
kinetic study by non-isothermal TG experiment at 5; 7.5; 10; and 15 °C min-1.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate the necessity of considering the thermal 
energy and tableting effects of BZN manufacturing, which contributes 
significantly to the molecular mechanistic understanding of this drug delivery 
system.

Interplay of Near-Zero-Field Dephasing, Rephasing, and Relaxation Dynamics and 
[1-(13)C]Pyruvate Polarization Transfer Efficiency in Pulsed SABRE-SHEATH.

P(2), Warren WS, Theis T(2), Goodson BM(3), Chekmenev EY(1)(4).

Hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate is a revolutionary molecular probe enabling 
ultrafast metabolic MRI scans in 1 min. This technology is now under evaluation 
in over 30 clinical trials, which employ dissolution Dynamic Nuclear 
Polarization (d-DNP) to prepare a batch of the contrast agent; however, d-DNP 
technology is slow and expensive. The emerging SABRE-SHEATH hyperpolarization 
technique enables fast (under 1 min) and robust production of hyperpolarized 
[1-13C]pyruvate via simultaneous chemical exchange of parahydrogen and pyruvate 
on IrIMes hexacoordinate complexes. Here, we study the application of microtesla 
pulses to investigate their effect on C-13 polarization efficiency, compared to 
that of conventional SABRE-SHEATH employing a static field (∼0.4 μT), to provide 
the matching conditions of polarization transfer from parahydrogen-derived 
hydrides to the 13C-1 nucleus. Our results demonstrate that using 
square-microtesla pulses with optimized parameters can produce 13C-1 
polarization levels of up to 14.8% (when detected, averaging over all 
resonances), corresponding to signal enhancement by over 122,000-fold at the 
clinically relevant field of 1.4 T. We anticipate that our results can be 
directly translated to other structurally similar biomolecules such as 
[1-13C]α-ketoglutarate and [1-13C]α-ketoisocaproate. Moreover, other more 
advanced pulse shapes can potentially further boost heteronuclear polarization 
attainable via pulsed SABRE-SHEATH.

Natural Variation of Fatty Acid Desaturase Gene Affects Linolenic Acid Content 
and Starch Pasting Viscosity in Rice Grains.

Zhang L(1)(2), Xia Y(1)(2), Dong Y(1)(3), Xie T(1)(2), Sun W(1)(3), Yu 
S(1)(2)(4).

Rice, as one of the main food crops, provides a vital source of dietary energy 
for over half the world's population. The OsFAD3 gene encodes fatty acid 
desaturase, catalyzing the conversion of linoleic acid (LA) to alpha-linolenic 
acid (ALA) in rice. However, the genetic characterization of OsFAD3 and its role 
in the conversion of LA to ALA remains elusive. Here, we validated the effects 
of two homologous genes, OsFAD3-1 and OsFAD3-2, on the ALA and LA/ALA ratio in 
rice grains using near-isogenic lines. Two major haplotypes of OsFAD3-1 are 
identified with different effects on the ALA and LA/ALA ratio in rice germplasm. 
High expression of OsFAD3-1 is associated with high ALA accumulation and eating 
quality of rice grains. Overexpression of OsFAD3-1 driven by a seed-specific 
promoter increases the ALA content up to 16-fold in the endosperm. A diagnostic 
marker is designed based on an 8-bp insertion/deletion in the OsFAD3-1 promoter, 
which can recognize OsFAD3-1 alleles in rice. These results indicate that 
OsFAD3-1 is a useful target gene in marker-assisted breeding programs to improve 
varieties with high ALA and appropriate LA/ALA ratio in brown rice.

    J Am Chem Soc. 2022 Nov 16;144(45):20976.

Peptide-RNA coacervates can result in the concentration and compartmentalization 
of simple biopolymers. Given their primordial relevance, peptide-RNA coacervates 
may have also been a key site of early protein evolution. However, the extent to 
which such coacervates might promote or suppress the exploration of novel 
peptide conformations is fundamentally unknown. To this end, we used electron 
paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) to characterize the structure and 
dynamics of an ancient and ubiquitous nucleic acid binding element, the 
helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) motif, alone and in the presence of RNA, with which it 
forms coacervates. Double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy 
applied to singly labeled peptides containing one HhH motif revealed the 
presence of dimers, even in the absence of RNA. Moreover, dimer formation is 
promoted upon RNA binding and was detectable within peptide-RNA coacervates. 
DEER measurements of spin-diluted, doubly labeled peptides in solution indicated 
transient α-helical character. The distance distributions between spin labels in 
the dimer and the signatures of α-helical folding are consistent with the 
symmetric (HhH)2-Fold, which is generated upon duplication and fusion of a 
single HhH motif and traditionally associated with dsDNA binding. These results 
support the hypothesis that coacervates are a unique testing ground for peptide 
oligomerization and that phase-separating peptides could have been a resource 
for the construction of complex protein structures via common evolutionary 
processes, such as duplication and fusion.

[Molecular pathological mechanism of liver metabolic disorder in mice with 
severe spinal muscular atrophy].

[Article in Chinese]

Liu L(1), Zhu M(1), Wang Y(1), Wan B(1), Jiang Z(1).

OBJECTIVE: To explore the molecular pathological mechanism of liver metabolic 
disorder in severe spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).
METHODS: The transgenic mice with type Ⅰ SMA (Smn-/- SMN20tg/2tg) and littermate 
control mice (Smn+/- SMN20tg/2tg) were observed for milk suckling behavior and 
body weight changes after birth. The mice with type Ⅰ SMA mice were given an 
intraperitoneal injection of 20% glucose solution or saline (15 μL/12 h), and 
their survival time was recorded. GO enrichment analysis was performed using the 
RNA-Seq data of the liver of type Ⅰ SMA and littermate control mice, and the 
results were verified using quantitative real-time PCR. Bisulfite sequencing was 
performed to examine CpG island methylation level in Fasn gene promoter region 
in the liver of the neonatal mice.
RESULTS: The neonatal mice with type Ⅰ SMA showed normal milk suckling behavior 
but had lower body weight than the littermate control mice on the second day 
after birth. Intraperitoneal injection of glucose solution every 12 h 
significantly improved the median survival time of type Ⅰ SMA mice from 9±1.3 to 
11± 1.5 days (P < 0.05). Analysis of the RNA-Seq data of the liver showed that 
the expression of the target genes of PPARα related to lipid metabolism and 
mitochondrial β oxidation were down-regulated in the liver of type Ⅰ SMA mice. 
Type Ⅰ SMA mice had higher methylation level of the Fasn promoter region in the 
liver than the littermate control mice (76.44% vs 58.67%). In primary cultures 
of hepatocytes from type Ⅰ SMA mice, treatment with 5-AzaC significantly 
up-regulated the expressions of the genes related to lipid metabolism by over 1 
fold (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Type Ⅰ SMA mice have liver metabolic disorder, and the 
down-regulation of the target genes of PPARα related to lipid and glucose 
metabolism due to persistent DNA methylation contributes to the progression of 
SMA.

< 0.01）。
结论: 严重的SMA小鼠发生肝脏代谢紊乱，肝组织中PPARα调控的脂代谢、糖代谢等相关基因持续甲基化而表达下调，加速SMA病程发展。

Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4α (HNF4α) Plays a Controlling Role in Expression of 
the Retinoic Acid Receptor β (RARβ) Gene in Hepatocytes.

Zolfaghari R(1), Bonzo JA(2), Gonzalez FJ(2), Ross AC(1).

HNF4α, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, regulates the genes 
involved in lipid and glucose metabolism. The expression of the RARβ gene in the 
liver of HNF4α knock-out mice was higher versus wildtype controls, whereas 
oppositely, RARβ promoter activity was 50% reduced by the overexpression of 
HNF4α in HepG2 cells, and treatment with retinoic acid (RA), a major metabolite 
of vitamin A, increased RARβ promoter activity 15-fold. The human RARβ2 promoter 
contains two DR5 and one DR8 binding motifs, as RA response elements (RARE) 
proximal to the transcription start site. While DR5 RARE1 was previously 
reported to be responsive to RARs but not to other nuclear receptors, we show 
here that mutation in DR5 RARE2 suppresses the promoter response to HNF4α and 
RARα/RXRα. Mutational analysis of ligand-binding pocket amino acids shown to be 
critical for fatty acid (FA) binding indicated that RA may interfere with 
interactions of FA carboxylic acid headgroups with side chains of S190 and R235, 
and the aliphatic group with I355. These results could explain the partial 
suppression of HNF4α transcriptional activation toward gene promoters that lack 
RARE, including APOC3 and CYP2C9, while conversely, HNF4α may bind to RARE 
sequences in the promoter of the genes such as CYP26A1 and RARβ, activating 
these genes in the presence of RA. Thus, RA could act as either an antagonist 
towards HNF4α in genes lacking RAREs, or as an agonist for RARE-containing 
genes. Overall, RA may interfere with the function of HNF4α and deregulate HNF4α 
targets genes, including the genes important for lipid and glucose metabolism.

Enhancement on antioxidant, anti-hyperglycemic and antibacterial activities of 
blackberry anthocyanins by processes optimization involving extraction and 
purification.

This research aimed to recover anthocyanin-rich extracts from blackberry (Rubus 
spp. Hull cultivar) by optimizing the processing conditions, and to characterize 
anthocyanin individuals and determine influences of optimization on enhancement 
of antioxidant and anti-hyperglycemic activities of anthocyanins as natural 
supplements. The ethanol concentration of 69.87%, HCl dosage of 0.53%, 
solid-to-liquid ratio of 1:19.06 at 47.68°C for 17.04 h were optimal to obtain 
the highest extraction yield of anthocyanins at 0.72 mg/g. By using AB-8 
macroporous resins, the anthocyanin concentration of 3.0 mg/mL, ethanol 
concentration of 90%, and elution rate of 2.0 mL/min were selected to boost the 
anthocyanin purity up to be 60.11%. Moreover, the purified anthocyanin extracts 
from blackberry contained nine main pigments which could be divided into three 
aglycone-based forms, and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside was the most abundant among 
them. Due to the successive processes of extraction and purification, the 
blackberry purified anthocyanin extracts (BA-PAE) showed much higher bioactive 
capacities than the blackberry crude anthocyanin extracts (BA-CAE) and 
blackberry fruit slurry extracts (BA-FSE), e.g., DPPH and ABTS radical 
scavenging activities (EC50 = 0.08 and 0.04, 0.32 and 0.24, and 1.31 and 0.41 
mg/mL), oxygen radical absorbance capacity (1.60, 0.59, and 0.15 mmol TEAC/g), 
cytoprotective effects against oxidative stress in PC12 cells (1.69-, 1.58-, and 
1.50-fold cell viability compared to oxidative group), α-amylase and 
α-glucosidase inhibitory activities (IC50 = 0.10 and 0.06, 0.56 and 0.32, and 
3.98 and 2.16 mg/mL), and antibacterial activity (93.23, 40.85, and 80.42% 
reduced biofilm).

Abutment margin levels and residual cement occurrence in cement-retained implant 
restorations: An observational study.

Kim HJ(1), Karasan D(2), Park K(3), Kwon HB(3), Han JS(3), Lee JH(3).

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association between different vertical levels of the 
abutment margin and residual cement prevalence in cement-retained implant 
restorations with customized abutments.
METHODS: One hundred and nine single-unit cement-retained implant restorations 
with a screw-access channel were included. The crowns were intraorally cemented 
on the abutments, and excess cement was removed. The abutment-crown complex was 
unscrewed, and the abutment-crown complex and peri-implant tissue were 
photographed. Residual cement presence was recorded by dividing the 
abutment-crown complex and peri-implant tissue into four quadrants: mesial, 
distal, buccal, and lingual. The prevalence of residual cement was compared 
according to the height of the custom abutment margin of the corresponding 
quadrant. A multilevel model was used for statistical analysis (α = .05).
RESULTS: Cement remnants were discovered on 72.48% of the dental implants. When 
the restoration quadrants were compared, cement remnants were present on 51.38%, 
39.45%, 20.18%, and 17.43% of the mesial, distal, buccal, and lingual surfaces, 
respectively (p < .01). Regarding the abutment margin level, cement residues 
were found in 60.22% and 61.4% of the 0.5 mm subgingival and ≥1 mm subgingival 
margin groups, respectively, which were significantly more than those in the 
supragingival (23.65%) and equigingival (26.59%) margin groups (p < .01). After 
adjustment for confounding factors, the adjusted odds ratio (with 95% confidence 
interval) for residual cement in the subgingival margin groups was 3.664 (1.71, 
7.852) when compared to the supragingival and equigingival margin groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The risk of residual cement occurrence was 3.66-fold higher with a 
subgingival abutment margin than with supragingival and equigingival abutment 
margins.

Downregulation of gamma subunit of TCP1 chaperonin of Leishmania donovani 
modulates extracellular vesicles-mediated macrophage microbicidal function.

Yadav S(1), Anand A(1), Chandra Balodi D(1), Ramalingam K(2), Mitra K(3), Maras 
JS(4), Goyal N(5).

T-complex protein-1 (TCP1) is a group II chaperonin, known to fold various 
proteins like actin and tubulin. In Leishmania donovani only one subunit that is 
gamma subunit (LdTCP1γ) has been functionally characterized as a homo-oligomeric 
complex that exhibits ATP-dependent protein folding. The gene is essential for 
the survival and infectivity of the parasite. Leishmania parasite releases 
extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing numerous virulence factors, which play 
an essential role in parasite pathogenesis and modulate host immune cell 
signaling. The present study demonstrates that LdTCP1γ is secreted in the EVs 
and modulates host macrophage functions. EVs isolated from LdTCP1γ 
single-allele-replacement mutants significantly upregulate the microbicidal 
function of LPS-induced macrophage as evident by increased levels of 
proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6), iNOS and NO production. Further, the 
comparative proteomics of wild-type and single-allele-replacement mutant EVs 
showed that out of 876 identified proteins, 207 were significantly modulated. 
Among them, the top 50 modulated and abundantly secreted proteins constitute 
∼40% of the total identified protein intensity and include virulence factors 
such as GP63, peroxiredoxin, enolase, HSP70, elongation factor 2, amastin, 
eukaryotic translation initiation factor and α-tubulin. The comparative 
proteomic analysis revealed that the proteome enrichment of the EVs from LdTCP1γ 
single-allele replacement mutants significantly differs from wild-type EVs, 
which may be responsible for the altered host microbicidal responses. Thus, our 
data provide new insight into the role of LdTCP1γ in EVs-mediated host-parasite 
interactions.

Domain swapping of the C-terminal helix promotes the dimerization of a novel 
ribonuclease protein from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Kim DH(1)(2), Na Y(3), Chang H(3), Boo JH(1), Kang SM(4), Jin C(3), Kang SJ(5), 
Lee SY(3), Lee BJ(3).

Polyketide metabolism-associated proteins in Mycobacterium tuberculosis play an 
essential role in the survival of the bacterium, which makes them potential drug 
targets for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB). The novel ribonuclease protein 
Rv1546 is predicted to be a member of the steroidogenic acute regulatory 
protein-related lipid-transfer (START) domain superfamily, which comprises 
bacterial polyketide aromatase/cyclases (ARO/CYCs). Here, we determined the 
crystal structure of Rv1546 in a V-shaped dimer. The Rv1546 monomer consists of 
four α-helices and seven antiparallel β-strands. Interestingly, in the dimeric 
state, Rv1546 forms a helix-grip fold, which is present in START domain 
proteins, via three-dimensional domain swapping. Structural analysis revealed 
that the conformational change of the C-terminal α-helix of Rv1546 might 
contribute to the unique dimer structure. Site-directed mutagenesis followed by 
in vitro ribonuclease activity assays was performed to identify catalytic sites 
of the protein. This experiment suggested that surface residues R63, K84, K88, 
and R113 are important in the ribonuclease function of Rv1546. In summary, this 
study presents the structural and functional characterization of Rv1546 and 
supplies new perspectives for exploiting Rv1546 as a novel drug target for TB 
treatment.

Investigation of TNFα Level and Metallothionein Gene Expression in Livers of 
Rats Exposed to Dietary Aluminum.

Jasim Mohammed B(1), Aso Taher T(2), Abdallah ZN(1).

Aluminum chloride is a chemical compound widely used in both pharmaceutical and 
industrial sectors. The present study aimed to assess the effect of aluminum 
chloride on TNF levels and metallothionein gene expression in rat livers. A 
total of 16 Wistar rats were used as an experimental model and assigned to four 
groups (n=4). The treated groups received aluminum chloride (Sigma/USA) at a 
dose of 25g/kg body weight via a feeding tube as follows: group 1: Non-treated 
rats as the control group, group 2 were treated with aluminum chloride for 8 
weeks, group 3 were treated with aluminum chloride for 12 weeks, and group 4 
received aluminum chloride for 16 weeks. The TNF-α was measured in liver tissue 
using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Immunohistochemistry and 
real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to analyze 
metallothionein gene expression in rat liver. To estimate TNF levels, the 
results revealed that levels were considerably higher (P<0.01) in all 
experimental groups, especially in group 4 which underwent treatment for 16 
weeks (401±22.1 ng/ml), as compared to that in the control group. For the 
immunohistochemistry assay, a gradient intensity of staining for liver tissue 
was observed, ranging from zero staining in the control group to moderate, 
medium, and high staining in the experimental groups after 8, 12, and 16 weeks 
of aluminum chloride treatment, respectively. The greatest amount of 
methylothionine expression was observed in the livers of group 4 which received 
aluminum chloride for 16 weeks (15.5-fold), with a significant difference 
(P<0.01) from the other experimental groups. In both immunohistochemical and 
RT-PCR experiments, aluminum administration had a substantial influence on TNFα 
levels and metallothionein expression in rat livers.

Role of SUMO-Specific Protease 2 in Leptin-Induced Fatty Acid Metabolism in 
White Adipocytes.

Kim PC(1), Lee JS(2), Chung SS(2), Park KS(1)(3).

BACKGROUND: Leptin is a 16-kDa fat-derived hormone with a primary role in 
controlling adipose tissue levels. Leptin increases fatty acid oxidation (FAO) 
acutely through adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and on 
delay through the SUMO-specific protease 2 (SENP2)-peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor δ/γ (PPARδ/γ) pathway in skeletal muscle. Leptin 
also directly increases FAO and decreases lipogenesis in adipocytes; however, 
the mechanism behind these effects remains unknown. Here, we investigated the 
role of SENP2 in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism by leptin in adipocytes 
and white adipose tissues.
METHODS: The effects of leptin mediated by SENP2 on fatty acid metabolism were 
tested by siRNA-mediated knockdown in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The role of SENP2 was 
confirmed in vivo using adipocyte-specific Senp2 knockout (Senp2-aKO) mice. We 
revealed the molecular mechanism involved in the leptin-induced transcriptional 
regulation of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1b (Cpt1b) and long-chain 
acyl-coenzyme A synthetase 1 (Acsl1) using transfection/reporter assays and 
chromatin immunoprecipitation.
RESULTS: SENP2 mediated the increased expression of FAO-associated enzymes, 
CPT1b and ACSL1, which peaked 24 hours after leptin treatment in adipocytes. In 
contrast, leptin stimulated FAO through AMPK during the initial several hours 
after treatment. In white adipose tissues, FAO and mRNA levels of Cpt1b and 
Acsl1 were increased by 2-fold 24 hours after leptin injection in control mice 
but not in Senp2-aKO mice. Leptin increased PPARα binding to the Cpt1b and Acsl1 
promoters in adipocytes through SENP2.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the SENP2-PPARα pathway plays an 
important role in leptin-induced FAO in white adipocytes.

Training in Male Adolescents.

Wang A(1), Zhang H(2), Liu J(3), Yan Z(1), Sun Y(1), Su W(1), Yu JG(4), Mi J(3), 
Zhao L(1).

Lipids play an important role in coordinating and regulating metabolic and 
inflammatory processes. Sprint interval training (SIT) is widely used to improve 
sports performance and health outcomes, but the current understanding of 
SIT-induced lipid metabolism and the corresponding systemic inflammatory status 
modification remains controversial and limited, especially in male adolescents. 
To answer these questions, twelve untrained male adolescents were recruited and 
underwent 6 weeks of SIT. The pre- and post-training testing included analyses 
of peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak), biometric data (weight and body 
composition), serum biochemical parameters (fasting blood glucose, total 
cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol, triacylglycerol, testosterone, and cortisol), inflammatory markers, 
and targeted lipidomics. After the 6-week SIT, the serum C-reactive protein 
(CRP), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, 
and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β significantly decreased (p < 0.05), 
whereas IL-6 and IL-10/TNF-α significantly increased (p < 0.05). In addition, 
the targeted lipidomics revealed changes in 296 lipids, of which 33 changed 
significantly (p < 0.05, fold change > 1.2 or <1/1.2). The correlation analysis 
revealed that the changes in the inflammatory markers were closely correlated 
with the changes in some of the lipids, such as LPC, HexCer, and FFA. In 
conclusion, the 6-week SIT induced significant changes in the inflammatory 
markers and circulating lipid composition, offering health benefits to the 
population.

Diet Quality and the Fecal Microbiota in Adults in the American Gut Project.

Baldeon AD(1), McDonald D(2), Gonzalez A(2), Knight R(3), Holscher HD(4).

BACKGROUND: The Dietary Guidelines for Americans advises on dietary intake to 
meet nutritional needs, promote health, and prevent diseases. Diet affects the 
intestinal microbiota and is increasingly linked to health. It is vital to 
investigate the relationships between diet quality and the microbiota to better 
understand the impact of nutrition on human health.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the differences in fecal microbiota 
composition in adults from the American Gut Project based on their adherence to 
the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.
METHODS: This study was a cross-sectional analysis of the 16S sequencing and 
food frequency data of a subset of adults (n = 432; age = 18-60 y; 65% female, 
89% white) participating in the crowdsourced American Gut Project. The Healthy 
Eating Index-2015 assessed the compliance with Dietary Guideline 
recommendations. The cohort was divided into tertiles based on Healthy Eating 
Index-2015 scores, and differences in taxonomic abundances and diversity were 
compared between high and low scorers.
RESULTS: The mean Total Score for low-scoring adults (58.1 ± 5.4) was comparable 
with the reported score of the average American adult (56.7). High scorers for 
the Total Score and components related to vegetables, grains, and dairy had 
greater alpha diversity than low scorers. High scorers in the fatty acid 
component had a lower alpha diversity than low scorers (95% CI: 0.35, 1.85). A 
positive log-fold difference in abundance of plant carbohydrate-metabolizing 
taxa in the families Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae was observed in 
high-scoring tertiles for Total Score, vegetable, fruit, and grain components 
(Benjamini-Hochberg; q < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Adults with greater compliance to the Dietary Guidelines 
demonstrated higher diversity in their fecal microbiota and greater abundance of 
bacteria capable of metabolizing complex carbohydrates, providing evidence on 
how Dietary Guidelines support the gut microbiota.

Apoptosis induction in leukemic cells by L-asparaginase preparation from 
Bacillus indicus: bench-scale production, purification and therapeutic 
application.

Sharma D(1), Mishra A(1).

With the emergence of multiple side effects on the usage of commercial 
L-asparaginase formulations, keen interest is provoked to investigate new 
sources of L-asparaginases that possess antileukemic properties with minimal 
side effects. The present study reports the cost-effective bench-scale 
production, homogeneity purification and apoptosis induction potential of a new 
L-asparaginase preparation from Bacillus indicus against human leukemia cells. 
The enzyme is highly specific toward the natural substrate L-asparagine. The 
study initiated with the enzyme production using cost-effective substrates in 
which a 3.28-fold enhancement of enzyme activity was achieved in comparison with 
an unoptimized medium using the central composite experimental design approach. 
The scale-up of the process in a 3.7-L batch bioreactor resulted in 
16.42 ± 0.17 IU/mL of L-asparaginase activity in 24 h. The crude extracellular 
enzyme was purified to homogeneity using anion exchange chromatography followed 
by gel filtration chromatography. A single band of approximately 35 kDa 
molecular weight was obtained on SDS-PAGE, while native PAGE analysis confirmed 
it to be a tetramer of four identical subunits. The circular dichroism 
spectroscopic study revealed the α + β mixed type of secondary structure with 
38.7% α-helices and 27.4% β pleated sheets. The antitumor toxicity exhibited on 
the MOLT-4 leukemia cells by the new L-asparaginase was revealed using the MTT 
assay and acridine orange/propidium iodide dual staining for live/dead cells. 
The flow cytometry analysis established the potential of the purified 
L-asparaginase to induce the apoptotic cell death mechanism in MOLT-4 leukemia 
cells. Conclusively, the L-asparaginase of Bacillus indicus is a highly 
promising candidate that can be introduced as a new enzyme therapeutic against 
various leukemia disorders.

A new hyper-thermostable carboxylesterase from Anoxybacillus geothermalis D9.

Johan UUM(1), Rahman RNZRA(2), Kamarudin NHA(3), Latip W(2), Ali MSM(4).

Carboxylesterases are attractive biocatalysts for various industrial 
applications, especially hyperthermophilic carboxylesterases, due to their high 
tolerance toward extreme environments. Such ability confers many advantages, 
including cost-effectiveness and an increased manufacturing rate. In the current 
work, we first described the characterization of EstD9, a new carboxylesterase 
from thermophilic Anoxybacillus geothermalis D9. Sequence analysis of EstD9 
revealed a significant identity (80 %) with thermophilic Est30 and a catalytic 
triad, composed of Ser93-His22-Asp193. As the protein sequence contained a 
conserved pentapeptide (GLSLG), EstD9 could be proposed as a new member of 
family XIII. The putative carboxylesterase was recombinantly expressed in E. 
coli BL21 (DE3) with a molecular mass of 28 kDa and successfully purified via 
affinity chromatography with recovery of 88.36 %. Using p-nitrophenyl butyrate, 
EstD9 presented excellent stability at high temperature range (70 °C-100 °C) and 
a broad pH tolerance (pH 6-9), with optimal activity at 80 °C and pH 7. Notably, 
EstD9 activity was stimulated in the presence of 1-propanol and DMSO with 
107.8 % and 108.9 % relative activities, respectively. The purified EstD9 
maintained 60 % residual activity after 30 min exposure to various surfactants 
and metal ions. Additionally, the inhibition studies demonstrated strong 
deactivation by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, dithiothreitol, and 
β-mercaptoethanol. The estimated Tm value was 72.12 °C. Unlike typical 
carboxylesterases, in silico 3D model of EstD9 disclosed a topological α/β 
hydrolase fold with a small α-helix cap. The enzymatic properties of EstD9 
suggest this enzyme to be a highly suitable catalyst for industrial bioprocesses 
under harsh conditions.

Multivalent glucosidase inhibitors based on perylene bisimide and iminosugar 
conjugates.

Yang JX(1), Li JJ(1), Yin FQ(1), Wang GY(1), Wei WT(1), Li XL(2), Wang KR(3).

Although multivalent glucosidase inhibitors based on iminosugars have shown 
enhanced inhibition activity, an effective way to improve their hypoglycemic 
effect in vivo, is still in infancy and needs further development. In this 
paper, PBI-5DNJ and PBI-6DNJ, with three or four DNJ moieties respectively 
conjugated at the bay position were synthesized. PBI-6DNJ evidenced stronger π-π 
stacking interactions and, when self-assembled, a smaller size than that of 
PBI-5DNJ. It was found that PBI-6DNJ exhibited superior α-glucosidases (from 
mice) inhibition activity (Ki = 0.14 ± 0.007 μM) in vitro than that 
(Ki = 0.31 ± 0.01) of PBI-5DNJ and in vivo hypoglycemic effects in mice models. 
PBI-6DNJ possessed good hypoglycemic effects with the percentages of PBG levels 
of 40.40 ± 3.33% and 39.23 ± 4.84% at a dose of 2.0 mg/kg after 15 min and 
30 min of administration, respectively. In terms of measuring percentage 
decrease of PBG level per DNJ unit, PBI-6DNJ displayed a 2.1-fold enhancement 
than miglitol, demonstrating a consistency between in vitro and in vivo 
experiments. This paves the way to the connection between in vivo hypoglycemic 
potency and in vitro glucosidase inhibition assay, leading to reliable and 
simplified assessment of hypoglycemic potency determination, and opening a basic 
understanding of the design of multivalent glucosidase inhibitors.

Significance of sea entry pathway of chum salmon Oncorhynchus keta fry, inferred 
from the differential expressions of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase α-subunit genes in the 
gills.

Nobata S(1), Iino Y(2), Kawakami T(3), Sasaki K(4), Kitagawa T(5), Hyodo S(6).

Na+,K+-ATPase (NKA) α-subunit 1a (α1a) and 1b (α1b) gene expressions in the 
gills are changeable in response to ambient salinity in a few salmonids. In this 
study, the expressions were compared among ambient salinities and used to infer 
sea entry migration of chum salmon Oncorhynchus keta fry. The expression of α1a 
decreased from the 2 days after seawater (SW) transfer from freshwater (FW) and 
was significantly lower in SW-acclimated fry than that in FW-fry. On the other 
hand, the expression of α1b peaked on the first to second day after SW transfer 
and then settled to a level 2-fold higher than in FW-fry. In fry caught in the 
waterfronts of the beaches, the expression levels were quite similar to those on 
the first and second days after SW transfer, whereas, in fry caught off beach, 
the expressions were identical to those of SW-acclimated fry. These suggest that 
fry adapt to SW with moving along the shoal in the bay, and move to off beach 
after completing SW adaptation. One of the physiological significances in a 
usage of waterfront may be to transform the gills to SW type. Only fry on the 
2 days after SW transfer failed to exhibit condition factor-dependency of burst 
swimming, probably due to physiological perturbation, which may be related to 
poor predation avoidance. The physiological approach used in this study inferred 
sea entry migration of fry; furthermore, it shows the possible significance of 
adaptation to SW in the shoal is to reduce predation risk.

Distinct effects of α-linolenic acid and docosahexaenoic acid on the expression 
of genes related to cholesterol metabolism and the response to infection in 
THP-1 monocytes and immune cells of obese humans.

Rodway LA(1), Pauls SD(2), Pascoe CD(3), Aukema HM(2), Taylor CG(4), Zahradka 
P(5).

BACKGROUND: Monocytes play a large role in chronic inflammatory conditions such 
as obesity, atherosclerosis and infection. Marine-derived omega-3 fatty acids 
such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) beneficially alter immune function and 
attenuate chronic inflammation in part by modifying gene expression. Comparisons 
with plant-derived omega-3 α-linolenic acid (ALA) on immune cell gene expression 
and function are limited.
METHODS: Transcriptome analysis was performed on THP-1 human monocytes treated 
with ALA, DHA or vehicle for 48 hr using fold change analysis, principal 
component analysis (PCA), partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), 
variable importance analysis (VIP), and ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA). 
Candidate genes were validated by qPCR. Functional assays evaluated the 
transcriptomic predictions. Expression of candidate transcripts identified in 
THP-1 cells were examined in PBMC from clinical trial (OXBIO; NCT03583281) 
participants consuming ALA- or DHA-rich oil supplements.
FINDINGS: ALA and DHA-treated monocytes presented distinct transcriptomic 
profiles as per VIP and PLS-DA. Both fatty acids were predicted to reduce 
cellular cholesterol content, while ALA would uniquely increase response to 
infection and chemotactic signals. Functional assays revealed ALA and DHA 
decreased cholesterol content. DHA significantly decreased the response to 
infection and chemotaxis, but ALA had no effect. Candidate transcripts responded 
similarly in PBMC from n-3 PUFA supplemented women with obesity.
CONCLUSION: ALA and DHA differentially alter the transcription profiles and 
functions associated with the response to infection, chemotaxis, and cholesterol 
metabolism in mononuclear immune cells. Thus, they may uniquely affect related 
disease processes contributing to obesity, atherosclerosis, and the response to 
infection.

The hops (Humulus lupulus) genome contains a mid-sized terpene synthase family 
that shows wide functional and allelic diversity.

Chen X(1), Wang MY(1), Deng CH(1), Beatson RA(2), Templeton KR(2), Atkinson 
RG(1), Nieuwenhuizen NJ(3).

BACKGROUND: Hops (Humulus lupulus L.) are a dioecious climbing perennial, with 
the dried mature "cones" (strobili) of the pistillate/female inflorescences 
being widely used as both a bittering agent and to enhance the flavour of beer. 
The glandular trichomes of the bract and bracteole flowering structures of the 
cones produce an abundance of secondary metabolites, such as terpenoids, bitter 
acids and prenylated phenolics depending on plant genetics, developmental stage 
and environment. More knowledge is required on the functional and allelic 
diversity of terpene synthase (TPS) genes responsible for the biosynthesis of 
volatile terpenes to assist in flavour-directed hop breeding.
RESULTS: Major volatile terpene compounds were identified using gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in the ripe cones of twenty-one hop 
cultivars grown in New Zealand. All cultivars produced the monoterpene β-myrcene 
and the sesquiterpenes α-humulene and β-caryophyllene, but the quantities varied 
broadly. Other terpenes were found in large quantities in only a smaller subset 
of cultivars, e.g. β-farnesene (in seven cultivars) and α-pinene (in four). In 
four contrasting cultivars (Wakatu™, Wai-iti™, Nelson Sauvin™, and 'Nugget'), 
terpene production during cone development was investigated in detail, with 
concentrations of some of the major terpenes increasing up to 1000-fold during 
development and reaching maximal levels from 50-60 days after flowering. 
Utilising the published H. lupulus genome, 87 putative full-length and partial 
terpene synthase genes were identified. Alleles corresponding to seven TPS genes 
were amplified from ripe cone cDNA from multiple cultivars and subsequently 
functionally characterised by transient expression in planta. Alleles of the 
previously characterised HlSTS1 produced humulene/caryophyllene as the major 
terpenes. HlRLS alleles produced (R)-(-)-linalool, whilst alleles of two 
sesquiterpene synthase genes, HlAFS1 and HlAFS2 produced α-farnesene. Alleles of 
HlMTS1, HlMTS2 and HlTPS1 were inactive in all the hop cultivars studied.
CONCLUSIONS: Alleles of four TPS genes were identified and shown to produce key 
aroma volatiles in ripe hop cones. Multiple expressed but inactive TPS alleles 
were also identified, suggesting that extensive loss-of-function has occurred 
during domestication and breeding of hops. Our results can be used to develop 
hop cultivars with novel/improved terpene profiles using marker-assisted 
breeding strategies to select for, or against, specific TPS alleles.

Classical pediatric Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) is a rare malignancy. Therapeutic 
regimens for its management may be optimized by establishing treatment response 
early on. The aim of this study was to identify plasma protein biomarkers 
enabling the prediction of relapse in pediatric/adolescent HL patients treated 
under the pediatric EuroNet-PHL-C2 trial. We used untargeted liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based proteomics at the time 
of diagnosis—before any therapy—as semiquantitative method to profile plasma 
proteins specifically associated with relapse in 42 children with nodular 
sclerosing HL. In both the exploratory and the validation cohorts, six proteins 
(apolipoprotein E, C4b-binding protein α chain, clusterin, fibrinogen γ chain, 
prothrombin, and vitronectin) were more abundant in the plasma of patients whose 
HL relapsed (|fold change| ≥ 1.2, p < 0.05, Student’s t-test). Predicting 
protein function with the Gene Ontology classification model, the proteins were 
included in four biological processes (p < 0.01). Using immunoblotting and 
Luminex assays, we validated two of these candidate biomarkers—C4b-binding 
protein α chain and clusterin—linked to innate immune response function 
(GO:0045087). This study identified C4b-binding protein α chain and clusterin as 
candidate early plasma biomarkers of HL relapse, and important for the purpose 
of shedding light on the molecular scenario associated with immune response in 
patients treated under the EuroNet-PHL-C2 trial.

Angiogenetic transcriptional profiling reveals potential targets modulated in 
blood of patients with cardiovascular disorders.

Ukkat J(1), Rebelo A(1), Trojanowicz B(1).

OBJECTIVES: Based on the angiogenetic, transcriptional profile of non-diseased 
and arteriosclerotic vessels, we aim to identify the leucocytic markers as a 
potential, minimal invasive tool supporting diagnosis of vascular pathology.
METHODS: Transcriptional profiling was performed with Angiogenesis RT2 Profiler 
PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) array on three non-pathological and three 
arteriosclerotic vessels, followed by immunohistochemical staining. Based on 
these screening results, selected transcripts were employed for qPCR with 
specific primers and investigated on the blood RNA (RiboNucleic Acid) obtained 
from nine healthy controls and 29 patients with cardiovascular disorders. 
Thereafter, expression of these transcripts was investigated in vitro in human 
monocytes under calcification-mimicking conditions.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Transcriptional profiling on the vessels revealed that 
out of 84 targets investigated two were up-regulated more than 100-fold, 18 more 
than 30 and 15 more than 10, while the most noticeable down-regulation was 
observed by ephrin-A3 and platelet-derived growth factor alpha (PDGFA) genes. 
Based on the vessel results, investigations of the selected blood transcripts 
revealed that thrombospondin 1 (THBS1), thrombospondin 3 (THBS3), transforming 
growth factor, beta receptor 1 (TGFBR1), platelet-derived growth factor alpha, 
plasminogen activator, urokinase (PLAU) and platelet/endothelial cell adhesion 
molecule 1 (PECAM-1) were significantly elevated in cardiovascular blood as 
compared to corresponding controls. Induction of calcification-related 
conditions in vitro to human THP-1 monocytes led to noticeable modulation of 
these transcripts. Taken together, these data demonstrate that leucocytic THBS1, 
THBS3, TGFBR1, platelet-derived growth factor alpha, PLAU and PECAM-1 have a 
correlation with cardiovascular disorders and could be used as a supportive tool 
predicting development of this pathological condition.



1058. Cocaine.

Drugs and Lactation Database (LactMed®) [Internet]. Bethesda (MD): National 
Institute of Child Health and Human Development; 2006–.
2023 Apr 15.

No data are available on the medical use of cocaine in nursing mothers. However, 
because of its chemical nature, high concentrations of cocaine are expected in 
milk.[1,2] Cocaine and its metabolites are detectable in breastmilk, although 
data are from random breastmilk screening of mothers who used cocaine 
recreationally rather than controlled studies. Cocaine breastmilk concentrations 
have varied over 100-fold in these reports. Newborn infants are extremely 
sensitive to cocaine because they have not yet developed the enzyme that 
inactivates it and serious adverse reactions have been reported in a newborn 
infant exposed to cocaine via breastmilk. Cocaine should not be used by nursing 
mothers or smoked (such as with "crack") by anyone in the vicinity of infants 
because the infants can be exposed by inhaling the smoke.[3,4] Other factors to 
consider are the possibility of positive urine tests in breastfed infants which 
might have legal implications, and the possibility of other harmful contaminants 
in street drugs. A breastfeeding abstinence period of 24 hours has been 
suggested for women who occasionally use cocaine while breastfeeding, based on 
the rapid elimination of cocaine by the mother.[5] Some authors have proposed 
that breastfeeding be discontinued only for those infants who test positive for 
cocaine exposure.[6] However, the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine suggests 
that women who have abused cocaine generally should not breastfeed unless they 
have a negative maternal urine toxicology at delivery, have been abstinent for 
at least 90 days, are in a substance abuse treatment program and plan to 
continue it in the postpartum period, have the approval of their substance abuse 
counselor, have been engaged and compliant in their prenatal care, and have no 
other contraindications to breastfeeding.[7]

Longitudinal study of the short- and long-term effects of hospitalisation and 
oral trimethoprim-sulfadiazine administration on the equine faecal microbiome 
and resistome.

Doorn DA(5)(9), Zomer AL(3)(4).

BACKGROUND: Hospitalisation and antimicrobial treatment are common in horses and 
significantly impact the intestinal microbiota. Antimicrobial treatment might 
also increase levels of resistant bacteria in faeces, which could spread to 
other ecological compartments, such as the environment, other animals and 
humans. In this study, we aimed to characterise the short- and long-term effects 
of transportation, hospitalisation and trimethoprim-sulfadiazine (TMS) 
administration on the faecal microbiota and resistome of healthy equids.
METHODS: In a longitudinal experimental study design, in which the ponies served 
as their own control, faecal samples were collected from six healthy Welsh 
ponies at the farm (D0-D13-1), immediately following transportation to the 
hospital (D13-2), during 7 days of hospitalisation without treatment (D14-D21), 
during 5 days of oral TMS treatment (D22-D26) and after discharge from the 
hospital up to 6 months later (D27-D211). After DNA extraction, 16S rRNA gene 
sequencing was performed on all samples. For resistome analysis, shotgun 
metagenomic sequencing was performed on selected samples.
RESULTS: Hospitalisation without antimicrobial treatment did not significantly 
affect microbiota composition. Oral TMS treatment reduced alpha-diversity 
significantly. Kiritimatiellaeota, Fibrobacteres and Verrucomicrobia 
significantly decreased in relative abundance, whereas Firmicutes increased. The 
faecal microbiota composition gradually recovered after discontinuation of TMS 
treatment and discharge from the hospital and, after 2 weeks, was more similar 
to pre-treatment composition than to composition during TMS treatment. Six 
months later, however, microbiota composition still differed significantly from 
that at the start of the study and Spirochaetes and Verrucomicrobia were less 
abundant. TMS administration led to a significant (up to 32-fold) and rapid 
increase in the relative abundance of resistance genes sul2, tetQ, ant6-1a, and 
aph(3")-lb. lnuC significantly decreased directly after treatment. Resistance 
genes sul2 (15-fold) and tetQ (six-fold) remained significantly increased 6 
months later.
CONCLUSIONS: Oral treatment with TMS has a rapid and long-lasting effect on 
faecal microbiota composition and resistome, making the equine hindgut a 
reservoir and potential source of resistant bacteria posing a risk to animal and 
human health through transmission. These findings support the judicious use of 
antimicrobials to minimise long-term faecal presence, excretion and the spread 
of antimicrobial resistance in the environment. Video Abstract.

Next Generation Exon 51 Skipping Antisense Oligonucleotides for Duchenne 
Muscular Dystrophy.

Bragge T(3), O'Neill C(4), Datson NA(1).

In the last two decades, antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) that induce 
corrective exon skipping have matured as promising therapies aimed at tackling 
the dystrophin deficiency that underlies the severe and progressive muscle fiber 
degeneration in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients. Pioneering first 
generation exon 51 skipping AONs like drisapersen and eteplirsen have more 
recently been followed up by AONs for exons 53 and 45, with, to date, a total of 
four exon skipping AON drugs having reached (conditional) regulatory US Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) approval for DMD. Nonetheless, considering the limited 
efficacy of these drugs, there is room for improvement. The aim of this study 
was to develop more efficient [2'-O-methyl-modified phosphorothioate (2'OMePS) 
RNA] AONs for DMD exon 51 skipping by implementing precision chemistry as well 
as identifying a more potent target binding site. More than a hundred AONs were 
screened in muscle cell cultures, followed by a selective comparison in the hDMD 
and hDMDdel52/mdx mouse models. Incorporation of 5-methylcytosine and 
position-specific locked nucleic acids in AONs targeting the 
drisapersen/eteplirsen binding site resulted in 15-fold higher exon 51 skipping 
levels compared to drisapersen in hDMDdel52/mdx mice. However, with similarly 
modified AONs targeting an alternative site in exon 51, 65-fold higher skipping 
levels were obtained, restoring dystrophin up to 30% of healthy control. 
Targeting both sites in exon 51 with a single AON further increased exon 
skipping (100-fold over drisapersen) and dystrophin (up to 40%) levels. These 
dystrophin levels allowed for normalization of creatine kinase (CK) and lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, and improved motor function in hDMDdel52/mdx mice. 
As no major safety observation was obtained, the improved therapeutic index of 
these next generation AONs is encouraging for further (pre)clinical development.

Emergence of highly profibrotic and proinflammatory Lrat+Fbln2+ HSC 
subpopulation in alcoholic hepatitis.

S(1), Yang Q(1), Asahina K(1)(3), Chen Y(4), Li M(4), Salomon M(5), Ng SW(6), 
Tsukamoto H(1)(2)(7).

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Relative roles of HSCs and portal fibroblasts in alcoholic 
hepatitis (AH) are unknown. We aimed to identify subpopulations of collagen type 
1 alpha 1 (Col1a1)-expressing cells in a mouse AH model by single-cell RNA 
sequencing (scRNA-seq) and filtering the cells with the HSC (lecithin retinol 
acyltransferase [Lrat]) and portal fibroblast (Thy-1 cell surface antigen [Thy1] 
and fibulin 2 [Fbln2]) markers and vitamin A (VitA) storage.
APPROACH AND RESULTS: Col1a1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) mice underwent AH, 
CCl 4 , and bile duct ligation (BDL) procedures to have comparable F1-F2 liver 
fibrosis. Col1a1-expressing cells were sorted via FACS by VitA autofluorescence 
and GFP for single-cell RNA sequencing. In AH, approximately 80% of 
Lrat+Thy1-Fbln2- activated HSCs were VitA-depleted (vs. ~13% in BDL and CCl 4 ). 
Supervised clustering identified a subset co-expressing Lrat and Fbln2 
(Lrat+Fbln2+), which expanded 44-fold, 17-fold, and 1.3-fold in AH, BDL, and CCl 
4 . Lrat+Fbln2+ cells had 3-15-times inductions of profibrotic, myofibroblastic, 
and immunoregulatory genes versus Lrat+Fbln2- cells, but 2-4-times repressed 
HSC-selective genes. AH activated HSCs had up-regulated inflammatory (chemokine 
[C-X-C motif] ligand 2 [Cxcl2], chemokine [C-C motif] ligand 2), antimicrobial 
(Il-33, Zc3h12a), and antigen presentation (H2-Q6, H2-T23) genes versus BDL and 
CCl 4 . Computational deconvolution of AH versus normal human bulk-liver 
RNA-sequencing data supported an expansion of LRAT+FBLN2+ cells in AH; AH 
patient liver immunohistochemistry showed FBLN2 staining along fibrotic septa 
enriched with LRAT+ cells; and in situ hybridization confirmed co-expression of 
FBLN2 with CXCL2 and/or human leukocyte antigen E in patient AH. Finally, HSC 
tracing in Lrat-Cre;Rosa26mTmG mice detected GFP+FBLN2+ cells in AH.
CONCLUSION: A highly profibrotic, inflammatory, and immunoregulatory Lrat+Fbln2+ 
subpopulation emerges from HSCs in AH and may contribute to the inflammatory and 
immunoreactive nature of AH.

Quality of life: A way to buttress crisis program evaluations?

Francová O(1), Korhonen K(2), Kovačević D(1).

To test the applicability of the quality of life concept (QoL) in evaluations of 
financial assistance programs to sovereigns, we apply the OECD well-being 
framework to the programs in a euro area country, and find that the 
multidimensional framework promises policy-relevant findings, capable of 
informing other approaches for evaluating program relevance and effectiveness. 
The framework's headline indicators nevertheless, needed to be complemented with 
additional indicators owing to data challenges. The well-being dimensions 
demonstrate that our primary country case and other assisted euro area countries 
struggled to protect some vulnerable groups before and during the crisis years, 
although many QoL indicators depict improvement once program completion 
approached. In many cases, gender, age and education level related differences 
were apparent, and should be better considered in future crisis programs. The 
framework also facilitates considering governance elements with our 
enhancements. It offers good grounds for deepening the understanding of 
stakeholders' perception of reform benefits or shortcomings, thus of program 
ownership. By using the OECD framework we explore some interpretative limits of 
QoL in evaluation, and underscore that a full program evaluation would require 
careful integration in primary case data. Further research and data set 
improvements would enhance this approach's utility.

Protein crystals grown in microfluidic droplets have been shown to be an 
effective and robust platform for storage, transport and serial crystallography 
data collection with a minimal impact on diffraction quality. Single 
macromolecular microcrystals grown in nanolitre-sized droplets allow the very 
efficient use of protein samples and can produce large quantities of 
high-quality samples for data collection. However, there are challenges not only 
in growing crystals in microfluidic droplets, but also in delivering the 
droplets into X-ray beams, including the physical arrangement, beamline and 
timing constraints and ease of use. Here, the crystallization of two human gut 
microbial hydrolases in microfluidic droplets is described: a sample-transport 
and data-collection approach that is inexpensive, is convenient, requires small 
amounts of protein and is forgiving. It is shown that crystals can be grown in 
50-500 pl droplets when the crystallization conditions are compatible with the 
droplet environment. Local and remote data-collection methods are described and 
it is shown that crystals grown in microfluidics droplets and housed as an 
emulsion in an Eppendorf tube can be shipped from the US to the UK using a FedEx 
envelope, and data can be collected successfully. Details of how crystals were 
delivered to the X-ray beam by depositing an emulsion of droplets onto a silicon 
fixed-target serial device are provided. After three months of storage at 4°C, 
the crystals endured and diffracted well, showing only a slight decrease in 
diffracting power, demonstrating a suitable way to grow crystals, and to store 
and collect the droplets with crystals for data collection. This sample-delivery 
and data-collection strategy allows crystal droplets to be shipped and set aside 
until beamtime is available.

Proinflammatory cytokines levels in sepsis and healthy volunteers, and tumor 
necrosis factor-alpha associated sepsis mortality: A systematic review and 
meta-analysis.

BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a global health challenge associated with significant 
morbidity and mortality. Detrimental sepsis effects are attributed to excessive 
inflammation or a "cytokine storm." However, anti-inflammation therapies have 
failed to lower sepsis mortality. We aim to characterize levels of key 
inflammatory cytokines in patients with sepsis and compare levels with those in 
healthy individuals and relate tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α levels to patient 
characteristics and outcomes.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis. Medline, Embase, 
Cochrane Library, and Web of Science Core Collection databases were searched 
between 1985 and May 2020. Analysis was restricted to studies in English. We 
included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled trials, cohort studies, 
case series, and cross-sectional studies that reported mean levels of cytokines 
in the circulation thought to be relevant for sepsis pathogenesis. We also 
evaluated concentrations of these cytokines in healthy individuals. The Quality 
in Prognosis Studies tool was used to assess the methodological quality of 
included studies. We extracted summary data from published reports. Data 
analyses were performed using a random-effects model to estimate pooled odds 
ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals for cytokine levels and mortality. 
This systematic review is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020179800).
FINDINGS: We identified 3654 records, and 104 studies were included with a total 
of 3250 participants. The pooled estimated mean TNFα concentration in sepsis 
patients was 58.4 pg/ml (95% Confidence Interval or CI 39.8-85.8 pg/ml), and in 
healthy individuals was 5.5 pg/ml (95% CI 3.8-8.0 pg/ml). Pooled estimate means 
for IL-1β and IFN-γ in sepsis patients were 21.8 pg/ml and 63.3 pg/ml, 
respectively. Elevated TNFα concentrations associated with increased 28-day 
sepsis mortality (p = 0.001). In subgroup analyses, we did not detect an 
association between TNFα levels and sepsis source, sepsis severity, or 
sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score. A TNF-α cutoff level 
≥14.7 pg/ml separated sepsis patients from healthy individuals with a 
sensitivity of 82.6%, a specificity of 91.7%, and a likelihood ratio of 9.9.
INTERPRETATION: Sepsis mean TNFα concentration is increased approximately 
10-fold compared to mean concentration in healthy individuals, and TNFα 
associated with sepsis mortality but not sepsis severity. The concept that 
elevated cytokines cause sepsis should be revisited in the context of these 
data.
FUNDING: None.

POLITAG-M-F as Heterogeneous Organocatalyst for the Waste-Minimized Synthesis of 
β-Azido Carbonyl Compounds in Batch and under Flow Conditions.

Valentini F(1), Brufani G(1), Rossini G(1), Campana F(1)(2), Lanari D(3), 
Vaccaro L(1).

We herein report a waste minimization protocol for the β-azidation of 
α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds using TMSN3. The selection of the appropriate 
catalyst (POLITAG-M-F), in combination with the reaction medium, resulted in 
enhanced catalytic efficiency and a low environmental footprint. The thermal and 
mechanical stability of the polymeric support allowed us to recover the 
POLITAG-M-F catalyst for up to 10 consecutive runs. The CH3CN:H2O azeotrope has 
a 2-fold positive effect on the process, increasing the efficiency of the 
protocol and minimizing waste generation. Indeed, the azeotropic mixture, used 
as a reaction medium and for the workup procedure, was recovered by 
distillation, leading to an easy and environmentally friendly procedure for 
product isolation in high yield and with a low E-factor. A comprehensive 
evaluation of the environmental profile was performed by the calculation of 
different green metrics (AE, RME, MRP, 1/SF) and a comparison with other 
literature available protocols. A flow protocol was defined to scale-up the 
process, and up to 65 mmol of substrates were efficiently converted with a 
productivity of 0.3 mmol/min.

Molecular mechanism of LIP05 derived from Monascus purpureus YJX-8 for 
synthesizing fatty acid ethyl esters under aqueous phase.

Fatty acid ethyl esters are important flavor chemicals in strong-flavor Baijiu. 
Monascus purpureus YJX-8 is recognized as an important microorganism for ester 
synthesis in the fermentation process. Enzyme LIP05 from YJX-8 can efficiently 
catalyze the synthesis of fatty acid ethyl esters under aqueous phase, but the 
key catalytic sites affecting esterification were unclear. The present work 
combined homology modeling, molecular dynamics simulation, molecular docking and 
site-directed mutation to analyze the catalytic mechanism of LIP05. Protein 
structure modeling indicated LIP05 belonged to α/β fold hydrolase, contained a 
lid domain and a core catalytic pocket with conserved catalytic triad 
Ser150-His215-Asp202, and the oxyanion hole composed of Gly73 and Thr74. Ile30 
and Leu37 of the lid domain were found to affect substrate specificity. The 
π-bond stacking between Tyr116 and Tyr149 played an important role in 
stabilizing the catalytic active center of LIP05. Tyr116 and Ile204 determined 
the substrate spectrum by composing the substrate-entrance channel. Residues 
Leu83, Ile204, Ile211 and Leu216 were involved in forming the hydrophobic 
substrate-binding pocket through steric hindrance and hydrophobic interaction. 
The catalytic mechanism for esterification in aqueous phase of LIP05 was 
proposed and provided a reference for clarifying the synthesis of fatty acid 
ethyl esters during the fermentation process of strong-flavor Baijiu.

Transcriptional regulation of the raffinose family oligosaccharides pathway in 
Sorghum bicolor reveals potential roles in leaf sucrose transport and stem 
sucrose accumulation.

Rooney WL(4), Mansfield SD(3), Mullet JE(1).

Bioenergy sorghum hybrids are being developed with enhanced drought tolerance 
and high levels of stem sugars. Raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs) 
contribute to plant environmental stress tolerance, sugar storage, transport, 
and signaling. To better understand the role of RFOs in sorghum, genes involved 
in myo-inositol and RFO metabolism were identified and relative transcript 
abundance analyzed during development. Genes involved in RFO biosynthesis 
(SbMIPS1, SbInsPase, SbGolS1, SbRS) were more highly expressed in leaves 
compared to stems and roots, with peak expression early in the morning in 
leaves. SbGolS, SbRS, SbAGA1 and SbAGA2 were also expressed at high levels in 
the leaf collar and leaf sheath. In leaf blades, genes involved in myo-inositol 
biosynthesis (SbMIPS1, SbInsPase) were expressed in bundle sheath cells, whereas 
genes involved in galactinol and raffinose synthesis (SbGolS1, SbRS) were 
expressed in mesophyll cells. Furthermore, SbAGA1 and SbAGA2, genes that encode 
neutral-alkaline alpha-galactosidases that hydrolyze raffinose, were 
differentially expressed in minor vein bundle sheath cells and major vein and 
mid-rib vascular and xylem parenchyma. This suggests that raffinose synthesized 
from sucrose and galactinol in mesophyll cells diffuses into vascular bundles 
where hydrolysis releases sucrose for long distance phloem transport. Increased 
expression (>20-fold) of SbAGA1 and SbAGA2 in stem storage pith parenchyma of 
sweet sorghum between floral initiation and grain maturity, and higher 
expression in sweet sorghum compared to grain sorghum, indicates these genes may 
play a key role in non-structural carbohydrate accumulation in stems.

Identification of crucial genes that induce coronary atherosclerosis through 
endothelial cell dysfunction in AMI-identifying hub genes by WGCNA.

Xiao S(1), Kuang C(1).

OBJECTIVE: To identify the most relevant genes of cardiovascular disease in 
acute myocardial infarction patients using weighted gene co-expression network 
analysis (WGCNA).
METHODS: The microarray dataset of GSE66360 was downloaded from the Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) website. The differential genes with adjusted P < 0.05 
and |log2 fold change (FC)| > 0.5 were included in the analysis. The weighed 
gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to build a gene 
co-expression network and identify the most significant module. Cytoscape was 
used to filter the hub genes. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes 
and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed for the hub genes. 
The key genes were defined as having high statistical and biological 
significance.
RESULTS: A total of 4751 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened 
from the dataset. The purple module had the highest significance in AMI. There 
were 47 hub genes identified from the module. The GO terms "amyloid beta protein 
metabolism" and "carbohydrate metabolism" and the KEGG terms "phagosome-related 
pathways" and "Staphylococcus aureus-associated pathways" were the pathways 
strongly enriched in AMI. Fatty acid translocase cluster of differentiation 
(CD36), formyl peptide receptor type 2 (FPR2), integrin subunit alpha M (ITGAM), 
and oxidized low density lipoprotein receptor 1 (OLR1) were considered key genes 
in AMI.
CONCLUSION: Our research suggested that the underlying mechanism was related to 
inflammation and lipid formation. The hub genes identified were CD36, FPR2, 
ITGAM, and OLR1.

Inulin accelerates weight loss in obese mice by regulating gut microbiota and 
serum metabolites.

Wu Z(1), Du Z(2), Tian Y(3), Liu M(3), Zhu K(3), Zhao Y(3), Wang H(3).

Several studies indicated that the gut microbiota might participate in the 
beneficial effect of inulin on obesity. However, the mechanisms involved were 
still largely unknown. Sixteen high-fat diets (HFDs)-induced obese C57BL/6 mice 
were converted to a normal diet and then randomized into two groups, OND (obese 
mice + normal diet) group gavage-fed for 10 weeks with normal saline and ONDI 
(obese mice + normal diet + inulin) group with inulin at 10 g/kg/day. The body 
weight of HFD-induced obese mice showed different degrees of decrease in both 
groups. However, the ONDI group lost more weight and returned to normal earlier. 
Compared to the OND group, inulin supplementation significantly shifted the 
composition and structure of gut microbiota, such as higher α diversity. The β 
diversity analysis also confirmed the changes in gut microbiota composition 
between groups. At the genus level, the abundance of Alistipes was considerably 
increased, and it was significantly correlated with inulin supplementation (r = 
0.72, P = 0.002). Serum metabolite levels were distinctly altered after inulin 
supplementation, and 143 metabolites were significantly altered in the ONDI 
group. Among them, indole-3-acrylic acid level increased more than 500-fold 
compared to the OND group. It was also strongly positive correlation with 
Alistipes (r = 0.72, P = 0.002) and inulin supplementation (r = 0.99, P = 
9.2e-13) and negatively correlated with obesity (r = -0.72, P = 0.002). In 
conclusion, inulin supplementation could accelerate body weight loss in obese 
mice by increasing Alistipes and indole-3-acrylic acid level.

Overexpression of wild type glycine alpha 1 subunit rescues ethanol sensitivity 
in accumbal receptors and reduces binge drinking in mice.

Araya A(1), Gallegos S(1), Maldonado A(2), Rivera-Meza M(2), Chandra R(3), Lobo 
MK(3), Aguayo LG(4).

The nucleus accumbens (nAc) is a critical region in the brain reward system 
since it integrates abundant synaptic inputs contributing to the control of 
neuronal excitability in the circuit. The presence of inhibitory α1 glycine 
receptor (GlyRs) subunits, sensitive to ethanol, has been recently reported in 
accumbal neurons suggesting that they are protective against excessive binge 
consumption. In the present study, we used viral vectors (AAV) to overexpress 
mutant and WT α1 subunits in accumbal neurons in D1 Cre and α1 KI mice. 
Injection of a Cre-inducible AAV carrying an ethanol insensitive α1 subunit in 
D1 Cre neurons was unable to affect sensitivity to ethanol in GlyRs or affect 
ethanol drinking. On the other hand, using an AAV that transduced WT α1 GlyRs in 
GABAergic neurons in the nAc of high-ethanol consuming mice caused a reduction 
in ethanol intake as reflected by lowered drinking in the dark and reduced blood 
ethanol concentration. As expected, the AAV increased the glycine current 
density by 5-fold without changing the expression of GABAA receptors. 
Examination of the ethanol sensitivity in isolated accumbal neurons indicated 
that the GlyRs phenotype changed from an ethanol resistant to an ethanol 
sensitive type. These results support the conclusion that increased inhibition 
in the nAc can control excessive ethanol consumption and that selective 
targeting of GlyRs by pharmacotherapy might provide a mechanistic procedure to 
reduce ethanol binge.

Phosphorylated walnut protein isolate as a nanocarrier for enhanced water 
solubility and stability of curcumin.

Ling M(1), Yan C(1), Huang X(1), Xu Y(1), He C(1), Zhou Z(1).

BACKGROUND: The low solubility and poor dispersion of alkaline-extracted walnut 
protein isolate (AWPI) limit its application as a protein-based carrier for the 
delivery of poorly soluble nutraceuticals, including curcumin. This work 
investigated the physicochemical characteristics of phosphorylated walnut 
protein isolate (PWPI) extracted using sodium tripolyphosphate (STP) and 
evaluated its encapsulation ability.
RESULTS: The results of phosphorus determination, X-ray photoelectron 
spectroscopy (XPS), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy confirmed 
the phosphorylation of the extracted PWPI. Circular dichroism (CD) analysis 
indicated that PWPI contained higher α-helix and lower β-sheet contents than 
AWPI. The PWPI prepared at pH 9.0 and 11.0 showed significantly improved 
solubility, similar surface hydrophobicity, and increased surface charges 
compared to the AWPI. Fluorescence quenching experiments indicated that the 
binding affinity of curcumin to PWPI was significantly higher than that of AWPI. 
When bound to PWPI, the solubility of curcumin in aqueous solution was greatly 
enhanced, with an 8700-fold increase at a nanocomplex concentration of 
10 mg mL-1 . The complexation of curcumin with PWPI significantly improved the 
storage stability of curcumin. Additionally, the PWPI-curcumin nanocomplexes 
showed significantly increased antioxidant capacity.
CONCLUSION: Phosphorylated walnut protein isolate showed greatly improved 
solubility and strong encapsulation ability, making it a promising nanocarrier 
for curcumin. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.

Metalloprotease domain latency protects ADAMTS13 against broad-spectrum 
inhibitors of metalloproteases while maintaining activity toward VWF.

Singh K(1), Madarati H(1), Sohrabipour S(1), Sparring T(1), Teney C(1), Kretz 
CA(2).

BACKGROUND: ADAMTS13 is a circulating metalloprotease that cleaves von 
Willebrand factor (VWF) in a shear-dependent manner. ADAMTS13 is secreted as an 
active protease but has a long half-life, suggesting that it is resistant to 
circulating protease inhibitors. These zymogen-like properties indicate that 
ADAMTS13 exists as a latent protease that is activated by its substrate.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the mechanism of ADAMTS13 latency and resistance to 
metalloprotease inhibitors.
METHODS: Probe the active site of ADAMTS13 and variants using alpha-2 
macroglobulin (A2M), tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases (TIMPs), and 
Marimastat.
RESULTS: ADAMTS13 and C-terminal deletion mutants are not inhibited by A2M, 
TIMPs, or Marimastat, but cleave FRETS-VWF73, suggesting that the 
metalloprotease domain is latent in the absence of substrate. Within the 
metalloprotease domain, mutating the gatekeeper triad (R193, D217, D252) or 
substituting the calcium-binding (R180-R193) or the variable (G236-S263) loops 
with corresponding features from ADAMTS5 did not sensitize MDTCS to inhibition. 
However, substituting the calcium-binding loop and an extended variable loop 
(G236-S263) corresponding to the S1-S1' pockets with those from ADAMTS5, 
resulted in MDTCS-GVC5 inhibition by Marimastat, but not by A2M or TIMP3. 
Substituting the MD domains of ADAMTS5 into full-length ADAMTS13 resulted in a 
50-fold reduction in activity compared with the substitution into MDTCS. 
However, both chimeras were susceptible to inhibition, suggesting that the 
closed conformation does not contribute to the latency of the metalloprotease 
domain.
CONCLUSION: The metalloprotease domain protects ADAMTS13 from inhibitors and 
exists in a latent state that is partially maintained by loops flanking the S1 
and S1' specificity pockets.

Ang1 and Ang4 differentially affect colitis and carcinogenesis in an AOM-DSS 
mouse model.

Hu A(1), Roberts C(1), Moscalu A(1), Redston M(2), Yoo J(1).

INTRODUCTION: Angiogenin-1 (Ang1) and angiogenin-4 (Ang4) are 14-kDa 
ribonucleases with potent angiogenic and antimicrobial properties. The role of 
Ang1 and Ang4 in chronic colitis and colitis-associated cancer has not been 
previously studied.
METHODS: Wild-type (WT) and angiogenin-1 knock-out (Ang1-KO) C57BL/6 mice were 
given azoxymethane, a colon carcinogen, 2 days in advance of three cycles of 
3.5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Disease activity index (DAI) was recorded, a 
colonoscopy was performed after each DSS treatment, and mice were euthanized 
(colitis, recovery, cancer) with tissue evaluated by histopathology. Ang1, Ang4, 
TNF-α, Il-1F062, IL-6, IL-10, IL-23, IL-33 mRNA levels were analyzed by RT-PCR.
RESULTS: Ang1-KO mice exhibited more severe colitis compared to WT mice during 
both the acute (P<0.05) and recovery (P<0.05) phases of each DSS cycle. 
Consistent with these results, colonic TNF-α, IL1-β, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-33 mRNA 
levels were significantly upregulated in Ang1-KO mice (P<0.05). While Ang4 
increased to similar levels in both WT and Ang1-KO mice during colitis and 
recovery phases, WT mice were distinguished by a significant upregulation of 
Ang1. Interestingly, despite the reduced colitis, WT mice developed 
significantly more tumors compared to Ang1-KO mice (P<0.05). 134 tumors formed 
in WT mice (4.6 tumors/mouse) while only 46 tumors formed (1.5 tumors/mice) in 
Ang1-KO mice, which were also characterized by a 34-fold decrease in Ang4 
compared to WT mice and the complete absence of Ang1.
CONCLUSIONS: In a mouse model of colitis-associated cancer, Ang1-KO mice develop 
more severe colitis, but fewer tumors compared to WT mice. Ang1 levels correlate 
with the severity of colitis and the development of colitis-associated cancer, 
while Ang4 was upregulated during both colitis and cancer. Ang1 and Ang4 play 
important regulatory roles in the response to chronic colitis and the 
development of colitis-associated cancer and may serve as novel therapeutic 
targets.

Identification of a Key Loop for Tuning Transglycosylation Activity in the 
Substrate-Binding Region of a Chitosanase.

Sun H(1), Zhao L(1), Mao X(2)(3), Cao R(1)(3), Liu Q(1).

Csn-PD, a glycoside family 46 chitosanase from Paenibacillus dendritiformis, 
exhibits endotype hydrolysis of chitosan and produces (GlcN)2 as the major 
product. Here, we report the crystal structure of Csn-PD at 1.68 Å resolution. 
The structure contains 14 α-helices and two β-strands that fold into two 
globular domains with the substrate bound between them. To evaluate the function 
of a loop in the substrate-binding region (residues 112-116, NDKHP), a mutant 
Csn-PDL1, in which this loop was deleted, was generated. Hydrolysis of chitosan 
by the mutant yielded chitooligosaccharides (COSs) with higher degrees of 
polymerization (DP) than the wild-type enzyme. Excitingly, (GlcN)6 was produced 
from smaller COSs via transglycosylation activity of the mutant. Hence, the 
catalytic performance of a chitosanase was altered by modification of a loop in 
the substrate-binding regions. Our novel data on a chitosanase with 
transglycosylation activity offer a promising way to produce COSs with high DP.

Natural anticoagulant discovery, the gift that keeps on giving: finding 
FV-Short.

Dahlbäck B(1).

The complex reactions of blood coagulation are balanced by several natural 
anticoagulants resulting in tuned hemostasis. During several decades, the 
knowledge base of the natural anticoagulants has greatly increased and we have 
also learned about antiinflammatory and cytoprotective activities expressed by 
antithrombin and activated protein C (APC). Some coagulation proteins have also 
been found to function as anticoagulants; e.g., thrombin when bound to 
thrombomodulin activates protein C. Another example is factor V (FV), which in 
addition to being a procofactor to FVa has emerged as an anticoagulant. The 
discovery of APC resistance, caused by FVLeiden, as a thrombosis risk factor 
resulted in the identification of FV as an APC cofactor working in synergy with 
protein S in the regulation of FVIIIa in the Xase complex. More recently, a 
natural anticoagulant FV splice isoform (FV-Short) was discovered when 
investigating the East Texas bleeding disorder. In FV-Short, the truncated B 
domain exposes a high-affinity binding site for tissue factor pathway inhibitor 
alpha (TFPIα), and together with protein S a high-affinity trimolecular complex 
is generated. The FXa-inhibitory activity of TFPIα is synergistically stimulated 
by FV-Short and protein S. The circulating FV-Short/protein S/TFPIα complex 
concentration is normally low (≈0.2 nM) but provides an anticoagulant threshold. 
In the East Texas bleeding, the concentration of the complex, and thus the 
threshold, is increased 10-fold, which results in bleeding manifestations. The 
anticoagulant properties of FV were discovered during investigations of 
individual patients and follow the great tradition of bed-to-bench and 
bench-to-bed research in the coagulation field.

Identifying Complex Emotions in Alexithymia Affected Adolescents Using Machine 
Learning Techniques.

ArulDass SD(1), Jayagopal P(1).

Many scientific researchers' study focuses on enhancing automated systems to 
identify emotions and thus relies on brain signals. This study focuses on how 
brain wave signals can be used to classify many emotional states of humans. 
Electroencephalography (EEG)-based affective computing predominantly focuses on 
emotion classification based on facial expression, speech recognition, and 
text-based recognition through multimodality stimuli. The proposed work aims to 
implement a methodology to identify and codify discrete complex emotions such as 
pleasure and grief in a rare psychological disorder known as alexithymia. This 
type of disorder is highly elicited in unstable, fragile countries such as South 
Sudan, Lebanon, and Mauritius. These countries are continuously affected by 
civil wars and disaster and politically unstable, leading to a very poor economy 
and education system. This study focuses on an adolescent age group dataset by 
recording physiological data when emotion is exhibited in a multimodal virtual 
environment. We decocted time frequency analysis and amplitude time series 
correlates including frontal alpha symmetry using a complex Morlet wavelet. For 
data visualization, we used the UMAP technique to obtain a clear district view 
of emotions. We performed 5-fold cross validation along with 1 s window 
subjective classification on the dataset. We opted for traditional machine 
learning techniques to identify complex emotion labeling.

Mutation-driven evolution of antibacterial function in an ancestral antifungal 
scaffold: Significance for peptide engineering.

Gu J(1), Isozumi N(2), Gao B(1), Ohki S(2), Zhu S(1).

Mutation-driven evolution of novel function on an old gene has been documented 
in many development- and adaptive immunity-related genes but is poorly 
understood in immune effector molecules. Drosomycin-type antifungal peptides 
(DTAFPs) are a family of defensin-type effectors found in plants and 
ecdysozoans. Their primitive function was to control fungal infection and then 
co-opted for fighting against bacterial infection in plants, insects, and 
nematodes. This provides a model to study the structural and evolutionary 
mechanisms behind such functional diversification. In the present study, we 
determined the solution structure of mehamycin, a DTAFP from the Northern 
root-knot nematode Meloidogyne hapla with antibacterial activity and an 18-mer 
insert, and studied the mutational effect through using a mutant with the insert 
deleted. Mehamycin adopts an expected cysteine-stabilized α-helix and β-sheet 
fold in its core scaffold and the inserted region, called single Disulfide 
Bridge-linked Domain (abbreviated as sDBD), forms an extended loop protruding 
from the scaffold. The latter folds into an amphipathic architecture stabilized 
by one disulfide bridge, which likely confers mehamycin a bacterial membrane 
permeability. Deletion of the sDBD remarkably decreased the ability but 
accompanying an increase in thermostability, indicative of a structure-function 
trade-off in the mehamycin evolution. Allosteric analysis revealed an interior 
interaction between the two domains, which might promote point mutations at some 
key sites of the core domain and ultimately give rise to the emergence of 
antibacterial function. Our work may be valuable in guiding protein engineering 
of mehamycin to improve its activity and stability.

The discovery and characterization of two novel structural motifs on the 
carboxy-terminal domain of kinetoplastid RNA editing ligases.

Moses D(1), Mehta V(1)(2), Salavati R(1)(2).

Parasitic protozoans of the Trypanosoma and Leishmania species have a uniquely 
organized mitochondrial genome, the kinetoplast. Most kinetoplast-transcribed 
mRNAs are cryptic and encode multiple subunits for the electron transport chain 
following maturation through a uridine insertion/deletion process called RNA 
editing. This process is achieved through an enzyme cascade by an RNA editing 
catalytic complex (RECC), where the final ligation step is catalyzed by the 
kinetoplastid RNA editing ligases, KREL1 and KREL2. While the amino-terminal 
domain (NTD) of these proteins is highly conserved with other DNA ligases and 
mRNA capping enzymes, with five recognizable motifs, the functional role of 
their diverged carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) has remained elusive. In this 
manuscript, we assayed recombinant KREL1 in vitro to unveil critical residues 
from its CTD to be involved in protein-protein interaction and dsRNA ligation 
activity. Our data show that the α-helix (H)3 of KREL1 CTD interacts with the 
αH1 of its editosome protein partner KREPA2. Intriguingly, the OB-fold domain 
and the zinc fingers on KREPA2 do not appear to influence the RNA ligation 
activity of KREL1. Moreover, a specific KWKE motif on the αH4 of KREL1 CTD is 
found to be implicated in ligase auto-adenylylation analogous to motif VI in DNA 
ligases. In summary, we present in the KREL1 CTD a motif VI for 
auto-adenylylation and a KREPA2 binding motif for RECC integration.

The Envelope Proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Potently Reduce the 
Infectivity of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1).

Henke W, Waisner H, Arachchige SP, Kalamvoki M, Stephens E.

Update in
    Retrovirology. 2022 Nov 19;19(1):25.

Background : Viroporins are virally encoded ion channels involved in virus 
assembly and release. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and influenza 
A virus encode for viroporins. The human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 encodes for at 
least two viroporins, a small 75 amino acid transmembrane protein known as the 
envelope (E) protein and a larger 275 amino acid protein known as Orf3a. Here, 
we compared the replication of HIV-1 in the presence of four different 
β-coronavirus E proteins. Results : We observed that the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV 
E proteins reduced the release of infectious HIV-1 yields by approximately 
100-fold while MERS-CoV or HCoV-OC43 E proteins restricted HIV-1 infectivity to 
a lesser extent. Mechanistically, neither reverse transcription nor mRNA 
synthesis was involved in the restriction. We also show that all four E proteins 
caused phosphorylation of eIF2-α at similar levels and that lipidation of LC3-I 
could not account for the differences in restriction. However, the level of 
caspase 3 activity in transfected cells correlated with HIV-1 restriction in 
cells. Finally, we show that unlike the Vpu protein of HIV-1, the four E 
proteins did not significantly down-regulate bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 
(BST-2). Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that while viroporins 
from homologous viruses can enhance virus release, we show that a viroporin from 
a heterologous virus can suppress HIV-1 protein synthesis and release of 
infectious virus.

An Extended C-Terminus, the Possible Culprit for Differential Regulation of 
5-Aminolevulinate Synthase Isoforms.

Hunter GA(1), Ferreira GC(1)(2)(3).

5-Aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS; E.C. 2.3.1.37) is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate 
(PLP)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the key regulatory step of porphyrin 
biosynthesis in metazoa, fungi, and α-proteobacteria. ALAS is evolutionarily 
related to transaminases and is therefore classified as a fold type I 
PLP-dependent enzyme. As an enzyme controlling the key committed and 
rate-determining step of a crucial biochemical pathway ALAS is ideally 
positioned to be subject to allosteric feedback inhibition. Extensive kinetic 
and mutational studies demonstrated that the overall enzyme reaction is limited 
by subtle conformational changes of a hairpin loop gating the active site. These 
findings, coupled with structural information, facilitated early prediction of 
allosteric regulation of activity via an extended C-terminal tail unique to 
eukaryotic forms of the enzyme. This prediction was subsequently supported by 
the discoveries that mutations in the extended C-terminus of the erythroid ALAS 
isoform (ALAS2) cause a metabolic disorder known as X-linked protoporphyria not 
by diminishing activity, but by enhancing it. Furthermore, kinetic, structural, 
and molecular modeling studies demonstrated that the extended C-terminal tail 
controls the catalytic rate by modulating conformational flexibility of the 
active site loop. However, the precise identity of any such molecule remains to 
be defined. Here we discuss the most plausible allosteric regulators of ALAS 
activity based on divergences in AlphaFold-predicted ALAS structures and suggest 
how the mystery of the mechanism whereby the extended C-terminus of mammalian 
ALASs allosterically controls the rate of porphyrin biosynthesis might be 
unraveled.

Sendai F/HN pseudotyped lentiviral vector transduces human ciliated and 
non-ciliated airway cells using α 2,3 sialylated receptors.

Munday RJ(1), Coradin T(2), Nimmo R(2), Lad Y(2), Hyde SC(1), Mitrophanos K(2), 
Gill DR(1).

A lentiviral vector (LV) pseudotype derived from the fusion (F) and 
hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) glycoproteins of a murine respirovirus (Sendai 
virus) facilitates efficient targeting of murine lung in vivo. Since targeting 
of the human lung will depend upon the availability and distribution of 
receptors used by F/HN, we investigated transduction of primary human airway 
cells differentiated at the air-liquid interface (ALI). We observed targeting of 
human basal, ciliated, goblet, and club cells, and using a combination of 
sialidase enzymes and lectins, we showed that transduction is dependent on the 
availability of sialylated glycans, including α2,3 sialylated 
N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc). Transduction via F/HN was 300-fold more efficient 
than another hemagglutinin-based LV pseudotype derived from influenza fowl 
plague virus (HA Rostock), despite similar efficiency reported in murine airways 
in vivo. Using specific glycans to inhibit hemagglutination, we showed this 
could be due to a greater affinity of F/HN for α2,3 sialylated LacNAc. Overall, 
these results highlight the importance of identifying the receptors used in 
animal and cell-culture models to predict performance in the human airways. 
Given the reported prevalence of α2,3 sialylated LacNAc on human pulmonary 
cells, these results support the suitability of the F/HN pseudotype for human 
lung gene therapy applications.

Transferable and Polarizable Coarse Grained Model for Proteins─ProMPT.

Sahoo A(1), Lee PY(2), Matysiak S(3).

The application of classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at atomic 
resolution (fine-grained level, FG), to most biomolecular processes, remains 
limited because of the associated computational complexity of representing all 
the atoms. This problem is magnified in the presence of protein-based 
biomolecular systems that have a very large conformational space, and MD 
simulations with fine-grained resolution have slow dynamics to explore this 
space. Current transferable coarse grained (CG) force fields in literature are 
either limited to only peptides with the environment encoded in an implicit form 
or cannot capture transitions into secondary/tertiary peptide structures from a 
primary sequence of amino acids. In this work, we present a transferable CG 
force field with an explicit representation of the environment for accurate 
simulations with proteins. The force field consists of a set of pseudoatoms 
representing different chemical groups that can be joined/associated together to 
create different biomolecular systems. This preserves the transferability of the 
force field to multiple environments and simulation conditions. We have added 
electronic polarization that can respond to environmental 
heterogeneity/fluctuations and couple it to protein's structural transitions. 
The nonbonded interactions are parametrized with physics-based features such as 
solvation and partitioning free energies determined by thermodynamic 
calculations and matched with experiments and/or atomistic simulations. The 
bonded potentials are inferred from corresponding distributions in nonredundant 
protein structure databases. We present validations of the CG model with 
simulations of well-studied aqueous protein systems with specific protein fold 
types─Trp-cage, Trpzip4, villin, WW-domain, and β-α-β. We also explore the 
applications of the force field to study aqueous aggregation of Aβ 16-22 
peptides.

Renally Clearable Ultraminiature Chain-Like Gold Nanoparticle Clusters for 
Multimodal Molecular Imaging of Choroidal Neovascularization.

Nguyen VP(1), Qian W(2), Zhe J(1), Henry J(1), Wang M(3), Liu B(2), Zhang W(3), 
Wang X(3), Paulus YM(1)(3).

Currently, available gold nanoparticles (GNPs) typically accumulate in the liver 
and spleen, leading to concerns for their long-term biosafety. To address this 
long-standing problem, ultraminiature chain-like gold nanoparticle clusters 
(GNCs) are developed. Via self-assembly of 7-8 nm GNP monomers, GNCs provide 
redshifted optical absorption and scattering contrast in the near-infrared 
window. After disassembly, GNCs turn back to GNPs with a size smaller than the 
renal glomerular filtration size cutoff, allowing their excretion via urine. A 
one-month longitudinal study in a rabbit eye model demonstrates that GNCs 
facilitate multimodal molecular imaging of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in 
vivo, non-invasively, with excellent sensitivity and spatial resolution. GNCs

Structure-Based Mechanistic Insights into ColB1, a Flavoprotein Functioning 
in-trans in the 2,2'-Bipyridine Assembly Line for Cysteine Dehydrogenation.

Ma X(1), Tang Z(2), Ding W(2), Liu T(1), Yang D(1), Liu W(2), Ma M(1).

The recruitment of trans-acting enzymes by nonribosomal peptide synthetase 
(NRPS) assembly line is rarely reported. ColB1 is a flavin-dependent 
dehydrogenase that is recruited by an NRPS terminal condensation domain (Ct 
domain) and catalyzes peptidyl carrier protein (PCP)-tethered cysteine 
dehydrogenation in collismycin biosynthesis. We here report the crystal 
structure of ColB1 complexed with FAD and reveal a typical structural fold of 
acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (ACADs). However, ColB1 shows distinct structural 
features from ACADs in substrate recognition both at the entrance of and inside 
the active site. Site-directed mutagenesis and substrate modeling establish a 
Glu393-mediated catalytic mechanism, by which the cysteine substrate is 
sandwiched between Glu393 and FAD to facilitate Cα proton abstraction and Cβ 
hydride migration. A ColB1-PCP-Ct complex model is generated, providing 
structural basis for the unique recruitment interactions between ColB1 and the 
associated NRPS. These results add insights into the mechanisms by which 
trans-acting enzymes function in an assembly line.

Coupling Cell Communication and Optogenetics: Implementation of a 
Light-Inducible Intercellular System in Yeast.

Rojas V(1)(2), Larrondo LF(1)(2).

Cell communication is a widespread mechanism in biology, allowing the 
transmission of information about environmental conditions. In order to 
understand how cell communication modulates relevant biological processes such 
as survival, division, differentiation, and apoptosis, different synthetic 
systems based on chemical induction have been successfully developed. In this 
work, we coupled cell communication and optogenetics in the budding yeast 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our approach is based on two strains connected by the 
light-dependent production of α-factor pheromone in one cell type, which induces 
gene expression in the other type. After the individual characterization of the 
different variants of both strains, the optogenetic intercellular system was 
evaluated by combining the cells under contrasting illumination conditions. 
Using luciferase as a reporter gene, specific co-cultures at a 1:1 ratio 
displayed activation of the response upon constant blue light, which was not 
observed for the same cell mixtures grown in darkness. Then, the system was 
assessed at several dark/blue-light transitions, where the response level varies 
depending on the moment in which illumination was delivered. Furthermore, we 
observed that the amplitude of response can be tuned by modifying the initial 
ratio between both strains. Finally, the two-population system showed higher 
fold inductions in comparison with autonomous strains. Altogether, these results 
demonstrated that external light information is propagated through a diffusible 
signaling molecule to modulate gene expression in a synthetic system involving 
microbial cells, which will pave the road for studies allowing optogenetic 
control of population-level dynamics.

Exploitation of High Tumour GSH Levels for Targeted siRNA Delivery in 
Rhabdomyosarcoma Cells.

Duan C(1), Townley H(1)(2).

Metastatic alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (aRMS) is an aggressive paediatric cancer 
with a poor prognosis. Downregulation of critical tumour genes using targeted 
siRNA remains an obstacle, but association with nanoparticles could help to 
deliver, protect, target, and enhance penetration. siRNA towards two genes was 
investigated: (i) Human αB-crystallin (CRYAB) and Heat Shock Protein Family B 
(Small) Member 2 (HSPB2), and (ii) Keratin 17 (KRT17). A mesoporous silica based 
nanosystem was linked to siRNA via disulfide bonds and loaded with IR820 dye. 
Transfection efficiency and signalling was evaluated, and the metabolic effects 
and cell proliferation were monitored in 2D culture and 3D spheroid models. The 
bound siRNA was protected from degradation with RNase I for at least 24 h. The 
delivered siRNA showed significant suppression of viability; 53.21 ± 23.40% for 
CRYAB and HSPB2 siRNA, and 88.06 ± 17.28% for KRT17 siRNA. After 72 h this 
increased to >50% cell apoptosis and necrosis. Intracellular total glutathione 
(GSH) levels were also compared with fibroblasts, and the RMS cell lines showed 
a several-fold increase. IR820 cellular uptake rate and penetration depth was 
significantly improved by nanoparticle delivery. Targetted siRNA delivery may 
pave the way for less invasive and more effective treatments of aRMS.

Characterization of 4 deletion mutants of Pseudomonas plecoglossicida and their 
potential for live attenuated vaccines in large yellow croaker (Larimichthys 
crocea).

Li Y(1), Chi Y(1), Li S(1), Jia T(1), Mao Z(2).

To search for live attenuated vaccines (LAV) candidates against Pseudomonas 
plecoglossicida, the causative agent of the visceral granulomas disease in 
farmed large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea), two type Ⅵ secretion systems 
(T6SS) and a predicted α/β fold family hydrolase encoding gene, ORF4885 were 
targeted to construct deletion mutants. The biological profiles of 4 mutants 
were characterized; LD50 to the croakers detected, in vivo survival 
post-infection investigated， relative percent of survival (RPS) of the croakers 
28d post-vaccination determined, and transcription of five immunity-related 
genes of the treated fish was quantified. On comparison to the WT, the mutants 
revealed similar growth curves in 11h; swarming motility of Δ4885 declined 
significantly at 72h post-incubation (P < 0.05); ΔS1Δ4885 showed significantly 
poor biofilm formation and weak resistance to fish serum bactericidal activity 
(P < 0.05). LD50 of the mutants were much higher than the WT, indication of 
strong virulence attenuation; in vivo survival test showed the mutant ΔS1Δ4885 
and ΔS1ΔS3 were eliminated by the host 10d post-infection, demonstration of the 
safety and potentiality to be LAV candidates. Immunization with the mutant 
ΔS1Δ4885 provided higher RPS than ΔS1ΔS3. Transcription of IgT was significant 
in all immunized groups while IgM increased only in intraperitoneally injected 
groups. This study successfully searched a quite safe and strong immunogenic LAV 
candidate to defeat P. plecoglossicida infection.

The Activity of Members of the UDP-Glucuronosyltransferase Subfamilies UGT1A and 
UGT2B is Impaired in Patients with Liver Cirrhosis.

Duthaler U(#)(1)(2), Bachmann F(#)(1)(2), Ozbey AC(3), Umehara K(3), Parrott 
N(3), Fowler S(3), Krähenbühl S(4)(5)(6).

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The impact of liver cirrhosis on the activity of 
UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) is currently not well characterized. We 
investigated the glucuronidation capacity and glucuronide accumulation in 
patients with liver cirrhosis.
METHODS: We administered the Basel phenotyping cocktail (caffeine, efavirenz, 
flurbiprofen, omeprazole, metoprolol, midazolam) to patients with liver 
cirrhosis (n = 16 Child A, n = 15 Child B, n = 5 Child C) and n = 12 control 
subjects and obtained pharmacokinetic profiles of substrates and primary 
metabolites and their glucuronides.
RESULTS: Caffeine and its metabolite paraxanthine were only slightly 
glucuronidated. The metabolic ratio (AUCglucuronide/AUCparent, MR) was not 
affected for caffeine but decreased by 60% for paraxanthine glucuronide 
formation in Child C patients. Efavirenz was not glucuronidated whereas 
8-hydroxyefavirenz was efficiently glucuronidated. The MR of 
8-hydroxyefavirenz-glucuronide formation increased three-fold in Child C 
patients and was negatively correlated with the glomerular filtration rate. 
Flurbiprofen and omeprazole were not glucuronidated. 4-Hydroxyflurbiprofen and 
5-hydroxyomeprazole were both glucuronidated but the corresponding MRs for 
glucuronide formation were not affected by liver cirrhosis. Metoprolol, but not 
α-hydroxymetoprolol, was glucuronidated, and the MR for metoprolol-glucuronide 
formation dropped by 60% in Child C patients. Both midazolam and its metabolite 
1'-hydroxymidazolam underwent glucuronidation, and the corresponding MRs for 
glucuronide formation dropped by approximately 80% in Child C patients. No 
relevant glucuronide accumulation occurred in patients with liver cirrhosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Detailed analysis revealed that liver cirrhosis may affect the 
activity of UGTs of the UGT1A and UGT2B subfamilies according to liver function. 
Clinically significant glucuronide accumulation did not occur in the population 
investigated.

Nucleocapsid protein binding DNA aptamers for detection of SARS-COV-2.

Neff CP(1), Cikara M(2), Geiss BJ(3), Thomas Caltagirone G(4), Liao A(4), Atif 
SM(1), Macdonald B(1), Schaden R(1).

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has infected 
millions of individuals and continues to be a major health concern worldwide. 
While reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction remains a reliable method 
for detecting infections, limitations of this technology, particularly cost and 
the requirement of a dedicated laboratory, prevent rapid viral monitoring. 
Antigen tests filled this need to some extent but with limitations including 
sensitivity and specificity, particularly against emerging variants of concern. 
Here, we developed aptamers against the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein to 
complement or replace antibodies in antigen detection assays. As detection 
reagents in ELISA-like assays, our DNA aptamers were able to detect as low as 
150 pg/mL of the protein and under 150 k copies of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan 
Alpha strain in viral transport medium with little cross-reactivity to other 
human coronaviruses (HCoVs). Further, our aptamers were reselected against the 
SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant of concern, and we found two sequences that had a 
more than two-fold increase in signal compared to our original aptamers when 
used as detection reagents against protein from the Omicron strain. These 
findings illustrate the use of aptamers as promising alternative detection 
reagents that may translate for use in current tests and our findings validate 
the method for the reselection of aptamers against emerging viral strains.

Isolation and Characterization of Lactobacillus paracasei 85 and Lactobacillus 
buchneri 93 to Absorb and Biotransform Zearalenone.

Gan M(1)(2)(3), Hu J(4), Wan K(1)(2)(3), Liu X(1)(2)(3), Chen P(1)(2)(3), Zeng 
R(1)(2)(3), Wang F(1)(2)(3), Zhao Y(1)(2)(3).

As one of the most prevalent estrogenic mycotoxins in cereals and animal feed, 
zearalenone (ZEN) can cause serious reproductive disorders. ZEN control in food 
and feed commodities has been an imperative area of research. In this study, 87 
lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from pickles and their ZEN (5 mg/L) 
removal abilities ranged from 0% to 68.4%. Then, five strains with potent ZEN 
removal ability (>50%) were identified: Lactobacillus plantarum 22, L. plantarum 
37, L. plantarum 47, L. paracasei 85, and L. buchneri 93. Under optimization 
conditions (48 h, pH 4.0, 37 °C, and 5 mg/L), the highest ZEN removal abilities 
of L. paracasei 85 and L. buchneri 93 reached 77.7% and 72.8%, respectively. 
Moreover, the two lactic acid bacteria decreased the toxicity of ZEN, because 
the levels of β-zearalenol (β-ZOL) transformed from ZEN were more than two-fold 
higher than α-zearalenol (α-ZOL). Additionally, cell free supernatant and pellet 
biotransformation of ZEN to α-ZOL and β-ZOL in LAB were detected for the first 
time. Furthermore, chemical and enzymatical treatments combined with 
Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analysis indicated that 
exopolysaccharides, proteins, and lipids on the cell wall could bond to ZEN 
through hydrophobic interactions. Scanning electron microscopy indicated that 
cell structure damage occurred during the ZEN clearance to L. buchneri 93, but 
it did not with L. paracasei 85. In addition, various organic acids, alcohols, 
and esters of the two LAB participated in ZEN removal. Hence, L. paracasei 85 
and L. buchneri 93 can be considered as potential detoxification agents for ZEN 
removal for food and feedstuff.

Upregulation of hypothalamic POMC neurons after biliary diversion in GK rats.

Zhou S(1), Chen W(1), Bai X(1), Chen J(2), Xu Q(1), Dong L(1), Chen W(3), Qu 
Q(1), He X(1).

BACKGROUND: Bile acids are important signaling molecules that might activate 
hypothalamic neurons. This study aimed to investigate possible changes in 
hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons after biliary diversion in 
diabetic rats.
METHODS: Ten GK rats were randomly divided into the biliary diversion (BD) and 
sham groups. The glucose metabolism, hypothalamic POMC expression, serum bile 
acid profiles, and ileal bile acid-specific receptors of the two groups were 
analyzed.
RESULTS: Biliary diversion improved blood glucose (P = 0.001) and glucose 
tolerance (P = 0.001). RNA-Seq of the hypothalamus showed significantly 
upregulated expression of the POMC gene (log2-fold change = 4.1, P < 0.001), 
which also showed increased expression at the protein (P = 0.030) and mRNA (P = 
0.004) levels. The POMC-derived neuropeptide α-melanocyte stimulating hormone 
(α-MSH) was also increased in the hypothalamus (2.21 ± 0.11 ng/g, P = 0.006). In 
addition, increased taurocholic acid (TCA) (108.05 ± 20.62 ng/mL, P = 0.003) and 
taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA) (45.58 ± 2.74 ng/mL, P < 0.001) were found in the 
BD group and induced the enhanced secretion of fibroblast growth factor-15 
(FGF15, 74.28 ± 3.44 pg/ml, P = 0.001) by activating farnesoid X receptor (FXR) 
that was over-expressed in the ileum.
CONCLUSIONS: Hypothalamic POMC neurons were upregulated after BD, and the 
increased TCA, TDCA, and the downstream gut-derived hormone FGF15 might activate 
POMC neurons.

The Anti-Histamine Azelastine, Identified by Computational Drug Repurposing, 
Inhibits Infection by Major Variants of SARS-CoV-2 in Cell Cultures and 
Reconstituted Human Nasal Tissue.

T(1)(2), Helyes Z(7), Kemenesi G(3)(4), Jakab F(3)(4), Nagy E(2)(6).

Background and purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose challenges, 
especially with the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants that are associated 
with higher infectivity and/or compromised protection afforded by the current 
vaccines. There is a high demand for additional preventive and therapeutic 
strategies effective against this changing virus. Repurposing of approved or 
clinically tested drugs can provide an immediate solution. Experimental 
Approach: We applied a novel computational approach to search among approved and 
commercially available drugs. Antiviral activity of a predicted drug, 
azelastine, was tested in vitro in SARS-CoV-2 infection assays with Vero E6 
cells, Vero cells stably overexpressing the human TMPRSS2 and ACE2 proteins as 
well as on reconstituted human nasal tissue using the predominant variant 
circulating in Europe in summer 2020, B.1.177 (D614G variant), and its emerging 
variants of concern; B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta) and B.1.617.2 (delta) 
variants. The effect of azelastine on viral replication was assessed by 
quantification of viral genomes by droplet digital PCR or qPCR. Key results: The 
computational approach identified major drug families, such as anti-infective, 
anti-inflammatory, anti-hypertensive, antihistamine, and neuroactive drugs. 
Based on its attractive safety profile and availability in nasal formulation, 
azelastine, a histamine 1 receptor-blocker was selected for experimental 
testing. Azelastine reduced the virus-induced cytopathic effect and SARS-CoV-2 
copy numbers both in preventive and treatment settings upon infection of Vero 
cells with an EC50 of 2.2-6.5 µM. Comparable potency was observed with the 
alpha, beta and delta variants. Furthermore, five-fold dilution (containing 
0.02% azelastine) of the commercially available nasal spray formulation was 
highly potent in inhibiting viral propagation in reconstituted human nasal 
tissue. Conclusion and Implications: Azelastine, an antihistamine available as 
nasal sprays developed against allergic rhinitis may be considered as a topical 
prevention or treatment of nasal colonization by SARS-CoV-2. A Phase 2 efficacy 
indicator study with azelastine-containing nasal spray that was designed based 
on the findings reported here has been concluded recently, confirming 
accelerated viral clearance in SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects.

Antitumour necrosis factor alpha treatment in Crohn's disease: long-term 
efficacy, side effects and need for surgery.

Lerang F(1), Holst R(2)(3), Henriksen M(1), Wåhlberg H(1), Jelsness-Jørgensen 
LP(1)(4).

OBJECTIVES: To examine the long-term efficacy and side effects of antitumour 
necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF) therapy in patients with Crohn's disease (CD), 
the need for surgery and the clinical outcome after discontinuing anti-TNF 
therapy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data were collected from the inflammatory bowel disease 
(IBD)-TNF register at Østfold Hospital Trust. Clinical and sociodemographic data 
were recorded for patients initiating anti-TNF therapy from January 2000 until 
December 2011. Follow-up was conducted until December 2017.
RESULTS: Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 40/154 (26%) patients at the 
last follow-up (median follow-up time 10 years). A total of 40 (26%) patients 
had to discontinue treatment due to serious side effects, and malignancy was 
recorded in 10 (6.5%) patients. Surgical resection was performed in 55 (36%) 
patients during follow-up. Patients with Montreal phenotype B2 before anti-TNF 
therapy were estimated to have a 2.54-fold greater risk of surgery than patients 
with phenotype B1 (p = .001). Of those with phenotype B1 before anti-TNF 
therapy, 19 (24%) of them developed stenosis in need of surgical resection 
('phenotype migration'). In patients followed up after discontinuing anti-TNF 
therapy (n = 89, median observational time six years), CR was achieved in most 
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term complete remission was achieved in only one in four 
patients receiving anti-TNF therapy, and one in four patients had to discontinue 
therapy due to side effects. Despite anti-TNF therapy, one in four patients with 
a baseline luminal disease phenotype needed subsequent surgical resection.

Improved automatic identification of isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior 
disorder with a 3D time-of-flight camera.

A(1), Bergmann M(1), Brandauer E(1), Garn H(2), Kohn B(2), Stefani A(1).

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Automatic 3D video analysis of the lower body during 
rapid eye movement (REM) sleep has been recently proposed as a novel tool for 
identifying people with isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD), but, so 
far, it has not been validated on unseen subjects. This study aims at validating 
this technology in a large cohort and at improving its performances by also 
including an analysis of movements in the head, hands and upper body.
METHODS: Fifty-three people with iRBD and 128 people without RBD (of whom 89 had 
sleep disorders considered RBD differential diagnoses) were included in the 
study. An automatic algorithm identified movements from 3D videos during REM 
sleep in four regions of interest (ROIs): head, hands, upper body and lower 
body. The movements were divided into categories according to duration: short 
(0.1-2 s), medium (2-15 s) and long (15-300 s). For each ROI and duration range, 
features were obtained from the identified movements. Logistic regression models 
using as predictors the features from one single ROI or a combination of ROIs 
were trained and tested in a 10-runs 10-fold cross-validation scheme on the task 
of differentiating people with iRBD from people without RBD.
RESULTS: The best differentiation was achieved using short movements in all four 
ROIs (test accuracy 0.866 ± 0.007, test F1 score = 0.783 ± 0.010). Single group 
analyses showed that people with iRBD were distinguished successfully from 
subjects with RBD differential diagnoses.
CONCLUSIONS: Automatic 3D video analysis might be implemented in clinical 
routine as a supportive screening tool for identifying people with RBD.

Citral-rich fractions of Lippia alba essential oils as immunoresponsive and 
anti-Candida albicans additives for collagen membranes in guided bone 
regeneration.

Rugeles-Páez NC(1), Quintero WL(1)(2), Stashenko EE(3), García LT(1).

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to optimize the immunoresponsive and 
anti-Candida albicans (C. albicans) properties of guided bone 
regeneration-resorbable membranes (collagen) using additives based on 
synergistic mixtures of chlorhexidine with terpene-enriched fractions from 
Lippia alba essential oils (EO).
METHODS: The anti-C. albicans activity of the fractions (individually or 
combined with chlorhexidine) was evaluated using planktonic and sessile 
cultures. J774A.1 murine macrophage cells were used to determine the 
cytotoxicity and immunoresponsive effects of the therapies.
RESULTS: The anti-planktonic and anti-sessile performance of chlorhexidine on C. 
albicans was improved 2- to 4-fold by supplementation with citral-rich 
fractions. On macrophages, this fraction also exhibited a potentially 
cytoprotective action against the toxic effects of chlorhexidine, minimizing 
damage to the cell membrane, mitochondrial membrane potential, and nuclear 
integrity. Macrophages growing on collagen-membrane fragments and stimulated 
with the citral fraction (alone or with chlorhexidine) showed a significant 
increase in releasing the osteogenic cytokine TNF-α and enhancing the IL-4.
CONCLUSION: This combined therapy appears as a promising platform for the 
development of a prophylactic or therapeutic biocidal solution that can optimize 
the pharmacological characteristics of chlorhexidine (epithelium tolerance and 
anti-C. albicans consolidation on surfaces), as well as potentiating the 
immunoresponsive properties of collagen membranes.

Measurement of craving among gamers with internet gaming disorder using repeated 
presentations of game videos: a resting-state electroencephalography study.

Park S(1), Ha J(2), Ahn W(3), Kim L(4)(5).

BACKGROUND: Internet gaming disorder (IGD) is receiving increasing attention 
owing to its effects on daily living and psychological function.
METHODS: In this study, electroencephalography was used to compare neural 
activity triggered by repeated presentation of a stimulus in healthy controls 
(HCs) and those with IGD. A total of 42 adult men were categorized into two 
groups (IGD, n = 21) based on Y-IAT-K scores. Participants were required to 
watch repeated presentations of video games while wearing a head-mounted 
display, and the delta (D), theta (T), alpha (A), beta (B), and gamma (G) 
activities in the prefrontal (PF), central (C), and parieto-occipital (PO) 
regions were analyzed.
RESULTS: The IGD group exhibited higher absolute powers of DC, DPO, TC, TPO, BC, 
and BPO than HCs. Among the IGD classification models, a neural network achieves 
the highest average accuracy of 93% (5-fold cross validation) and 84% (test).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings may significantly contribute to a more comprehensive 
understanding of the neurological features associated with IGD and provide 
potential neurological markers that can be used to distinguish between 
individuals with IGD and HCs.

In vitro profiling of rheumatic-disease-evaluated JAK inhibitors demonstrate 
differences in JAK isoform selectivity between different types of inhibitors.

Virtanen A(1)(2), Palmroth M(2), Liukkonen S(2), Kurttila A(2), Haikarainen 
T(2)(3), Isomäki P(2)(4), Silvennoinen O(1)(2)(3).

OBJECTIVE: Selectivity of JAK inhibitors (JAKinibs) form the basis for 
understanding their clinical characteristics, but the evaluation is hampered by 
the lack of comprehensive head-to-head studies. Our objective was to profile in 
parallel JAKinibs indicated or evaluated for rheumatic diseases for their JAK 
and cytokine selectivity in vitro.
METHODS: Ten JAKinibs were analyzed for JAK-isoform selectivity by assaying 
their inhibition of JAK kinase activity, binding to kinase and pseudokinase 
domains, and inhibition of cytokine signaling in blood of healthy volunteers and 
in isolated PBMCs of RA patients and healthy donors.
RESULTS: Pan-JAKinibs effectively suppressed kinase activity of two to three 
JAKs, while isoform-targeted JAKinibs possessed varying degrees of selectivity 
for one or two JAK family members. In human leukocytes, JAKinibs predominantly 
inhibited JAK1-dependent cytokines IL-2, IL-6 and interferons, inhibition of 
these cytokines was more pronounced in RA cells compared to healthy controls, 
and some cell-type and STAT isoform differences were observed. Novel JAKinibs 
demonstrated high selectivity: Covalent JAKinib ritlecitinib showed 
900-2500-fold selectivity for JAK3 over other JAKs and specific suppression of 
IL-2-signaling, whereas allosteric TYK2 inhibitor deucravacitinib inhibited 
IFN-α-signaling with high specificity. Interestingly, deucravacitinib targeted 
regulatory pseudokinase domain and did not affect JAK in vitro kinase activity.
CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of JAK kinase activity did not directly translate into 
cellular inhibition of JAK-STAT signaling. Despite differences in 
JAK-selectivity, the cytokine inhibition profiles of currently approved JAKinibs 
were highly similar with preference for JAK1-mediated cytokines. Novel types of 
JAKinibs showed narrow cytokine inhibition profile specific for JAK3- or 
TYK2-mediated signaling. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

Evidence of microplastics release from polythene and paper cups exposed to hot 
and cold: A case study on the compromised kinetics of catalase.

Microplastics (MPs) have become widespread in the modern world posing a hidden 
threat to the global environment. However, growing accumulation and devastating 
impact of MPs on human health and the environment have received least attention. 
In the current investigation, for the first time MPs have been identified which 
are released from the daily usable materials like polythene bags (PB) and paper 
cups (PC) in response to hot and cold water exposure at different time 
intervals. The impact of these MPs has been assessed on the major antioxidant 
enzyme, bovine liver catalase (BLC). The binding of MPs caused conformational 
changes in BLC by decreasing the α-helical content, which results in reduction 
of the enzymatic activity. Kinetics study revealed nearly ∼1.4-fold compromised 
catalytic efficiency of catalase in response to MPs. Nevertheless, hepatic 
catalase activity was also significantly decreased in presence of MPs. Further, 
materials like glass, porcelain, stainless steel, and high-grade plastics are 
discovered as greener alternatives to PB and PC.

Raw materials or bioactive ingredients trigger mechanisms to assimilate 
nutrients and activate metabolic pathways that promote growth, immune function, 
or energy storage. Our understanding of these processes at a molecular level 
remains limited in aquaculture, especially in shrimp. Here, hepatopancreas 
proteomics and haemolymph metabolomics were used to investigate the 
post-prandial response of black tiger shrimps (Penaeus monodon) fed a 
conventional fishmeal diet (FM); a diet supplemented with the microbial biomass 
Novacq™ (NV); krill meal (KM); or, fasted (FS). Using FM as a control, a 2-fold 
change in abundance threshold was implemented to determine the significance of 
proteins and metabolites. NV fed shrimp showed preference for energy derived 
from carbohydrates indicated by a strong signature of glycoconjugate metabolism 
and activation of the amino- and nucleotide sugar metabolic pathway. KM 
activated the glyoxylate and dicarboxylate pathway that denoted shrimp 
preference for lipidic energy. KM also influenced energy generation by the TCA 
cycle inferred from higher abundance of the metabolites succinic semialdehyde, 
citric acid, isocitrate, alpha ketoglutarate and ATP and downregulation of the 
enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase that catalyses oxidative decarboxylation of 
isocitrate. FS shrimp displayed down-regulation of oxidative phosphorylation and 
resorted to internal lipid reserves for energy homeostasis displaying a strong 
signature of autophagy. Pyrimidine metabolism was the preferred energy strategy 
in this group. Our study also provided evidence that during fasting or 
consumption of specific ingredients, shrimp share common pathways to meet their 
energy requirements, however, the intensity at which these pathways were 
impacted was diet dependent.

Bovine Enteroids as an In Vitro Model for Infection with Bovine Coronavirus.

Shakya R(1), Jiménez-Meléndez A(1), Robertson LJ(1), Myrmel M(1).

Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is one of the major viral pathogens of cattle, 
responsible for economic losses and causing a substantial impact on animal 
welfare. Several in vitro 2D models have been used to investigate BCoV infection 
and its pathogenesis. However, 3D enteroids are likely to be a better model with 
which to investigate host-pathogen interactions. This study established bovine 
enteroids as an in vitro replication system for BCoV, and we compared the 
expression of selected genes during the BCoV infection of the enteroids with the 
expression previously described in HCT-8 cells. The enteroids were successfully 
established from bovine ileum and permissive to BCoV, as shown by a seven-fold 
increase in viral RNA after 72 h. Immunostaining of differentiation markers 
showed a mixed population of differentiated cells. Gene expression ratios at 72 
h showed that pro-inflammatory responses such as IL-8 and IL-1A remained 
unchanged in response to BCoV infection. Expression of other immune genes, 
including CXCL-3, MMP13, and TNF-α, was significantly downregulated. This study 
shows that the bovine enteroids had a differentiated cell population and were 
permissive to BCoV. Further studies are necessary for a comparative analysis to 
determine whether enteroids are suitable in vitro models to study host responses 
during BCoV infection.

The transcription factor IbNAC29 positively regulates the carotenoid 
accumulation in sweet potato.

N(1), Gao S(1), Liu Q(1).

Carotenoid is a tetraterpene pigment beneficial for human health. Although the 
carotenoid biosynthesis pathway has been extensively studied in plants, 
relatively little is known about their regulation in sweet potato. Previously, 
we conducted the transcriptome database of differentially expressed genes 
between the sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) cultivar 'Weiduoli' and its 
high-carotenoid mutant 'HVB-3'. In this study, we selected one of these 
candidate genes, IbNAC29, for subsequent analyses. IbNAC29 belongs to the 
plant-specific NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC2) transcription factor family. 
Relative IbNAC29 mRNA level in the HVB-3 storage roots was ~1.71-fold higher 
than Weiduoli. Additional experiments showed that the contents of α-carotene, 
lutein, β-carotene, zeaxanthin, and capsanthin are obviously increased in the 
storage roots of transgenic sweet potato plants overexpressing IbNAC29. 
Moreover, the levels of carotenoid biosynthesis genes in transgenic plants were 
also up-regulated. Nevertheless, yeast one-hybrid assays indicated that IbNAC29 
could not directly bind to the promoters of these carotenoid biosynthesis genes. 
Furthermore, the level of IbSGR1 was down-regulated, whose homologous genes in 
tomato can negatively regulate carotene accumulation. Yeast three-hybrid 
analysis revealed that the IbNAC29-IbMYB1R1-IbAITR5 could form a regulatory 
module. Yeast one-hybrid, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, quantitative PCR 
analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation and dual-luciferase reporter assay 
showed that IbAITR5 directly binds to and inhibits the promoter activity of 
IbSGR1, up-regulating carotenoid biosynthesis gene IbPSY. Taken together, 
IbNAC29 is a potential candidate gene for the genetic improvement of nutritive 
value in sweet potato.

Azobenzene-Based Amino Acids for the Photocontrol of Coiled-Coil Peptides.

Crone NSA(1), van Hilten N(1), van der Ham A(1), Risselada HJ(1), Kros A(1), 
Boyle AL(1).

Coiled-coil peptides are high-affinity, selective, self-assembling binding 
motifs, making them attractive components for the preparation of functional 
biomaterials. Photocontrol of coiled-coil self-assembly allows for the precise 
localization of their activity. To rationally explore photoactivity in a model 
coiled coil, three azobenzene-containing amino acids were prepared and 
substituted into the hydrophobic core of the E3/K3 coiled-coil heterodimer. Two 
of the non-natural amino acids, APhe1 and APhe2, are based on phenylalanine and 
differ in the presence of a carboxylic acid group. These have previously been 
demonstrated to modulate protein activity. When incorporated into peptide K3, 
coiled-coil binding strength was affected upon isomerization, with the two 
variants differing in their most folded state. The third azobenzene-containing 
amino acid, APgly, is based on phenylglycine and was prepared to investigate the 
effect of amino acid size on photoisomerization. When APgly is incorporated into 
the coiled coil, a 4.7-fold decrease in folding constant is observed upon 
trans-to-cis isomerization─the largest difference for all three amino acids. 
Omitting the methylene group between azobenzene and α-carbon was theorized to 
both position the diazene of APgly closer to the hydrophobic amino acids and 
reduce the possible rotations of the amino acid, with molecular dynamics 
simulations supporting these hypotheses. These results demonstrate the ability 
of photoswitchable amino acids to control coiled-coil assembly through 
disruption of the hydrophobic interface, a strategy that should be widely 
applicable.

F(3), Qiu D(4).

Cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) is highly expressed in a variety of tumors and 
implicated to drug resistance. More and more researches have suggested that 
CYP1B1 is a new target for cancer prevention and therapy. Various CYP1B1 
inhibitors with a rigid polycyclic skeleton have been developed, such as 
flavonoids, trans-stilbenes, and quinazolines. To obtain a new class of CYP1B1 
inhibitors, we designed and synthesized a series of bentranil analogues, 
moreover, IC50 determinations were performed for CYP1B1 inhibition of five of 
these compounds and found that 6o and 6q were the best inhibitors, with IC50 
values in the nM range. The selectivity index (SI) of CYP1B1 over CYP1A1 and 
CYP1A2 was 30-fold higher than that of α-naphthoflavone (ANF). The molecular 
docking results showed that compound 6q fitted better into the CYP1B1 binding 
site than other compounds, which was consistent with our experimental results. 
On the basis of 6o and 6q, it is expected to develop CYP1B1 inhibitors with 
stronger affinity, higher selectivity and better solubility.

Farnesyl pyrophosphate compartmentalization in the green microalga 
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii during heterologous (E)-α-bisabolene production.

Wichmann J(1), Eggert A(1), Elbourne LDH(2), Paulsen IT(2), Lauersen KJ(1), 
Kruse O(3).

BACKGROUND: Eukaryotic algae have recently emerged as hosts for metabolic 
engineering efforts to generate heterologous isoprenoids. Isoprenoid metabolic 
architectures, flux, subcellular localization, and transport dynamics have not 
yet been fully elucidated in algal hosts.
RESULTS: In this study, we investigated the accessibility of different 
isoprenoid precursor pools for C15 sesquiterpenoid generation in the cytoplasm 
and chloroplast of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii using the Abies grandis bisabolene 
synthase (AgBS) as a reporter. The abundance of the C15 sesquiterpene precursor 
farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) was not increased in the cytosol by co-expression 
and fusion of AgBS with different FPP synthases (FPPSs), indicating limited C5 
precursor availability in the cytoplasm. However, FPP was shown to be available 
in the plastid stroma, where bisabolene titers could be improved several-fold by 
FPPSs. Sesquiterpene production was greatest when AgBS-FPPS fusions were 
directed to the plastid and could further be improved by increasing the gene 
dosage. During scale-up cultivation with different carbon sources and light 
regimes, specific sesquiterpene productivities from the plastid were highest 
with CO2 as the only carbon source and light:dark illumination cycles. Potential 
prenyl unit transporters are proposed based on bioinformatic analyses, which may 
be in part responsible for our observations.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the algal chloroplast can be harnessed 
in addition to the cytosol to exploit the full potential of algae as green cell 
factories for non-native sesquiterpenoid generation. Identification of a prenyl 
transporter may be leveraged for further extending this capacity.

Toll-like receptor 4-mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress induces intestinal 
paneth cell damage in mice following CLP-induced sepsis.

Wang Y(#)(1), Zhang D(#)(2), Li C(3), Wu X(3), He C(3), Zhu X(3), Zhao H(3), Mu 
L(3).

A marked elevation of TLR4 was observed in various organs of septic mice. The 
mechanism of TLR4 in intestinal epithelial cell damage in sepsis remains 
unclear. CLP mice models were used to assess the role of TLR4 in intestinal 
Paneth cell damage by histological, polymerase chain reaction, western-blot 
analyses. The ileal expression of TLR4 was increased by more than five-fold 
after CLP. CLP significantly increased 7-day mortality and was associated with a 
higher murine sepsis score (MSS), closely related with increased TLR4 
expression. Histological staining revealed that a reduced number of Paneth 
cells, accompanied by reduced lysozyme and defensin alpha 5(DEF-5) expression as 
detected by PCR. Of note, the expression levels of ATF6, XBP1 and CHOP increased 
in the ileal of the sepsis group. Meanwhile, the uncleaved p90 ATF6 was markedly 
reduced and cleaved p50 ATF6 was increased in the sepsis group. Intriguingly, 
The TAK-242 had improved intestinal mucosal injury, reduced the expression of 
ATF6, XBP1 and CHOP and relieved the cleavage of ATF6. We found that increased 
the expression level of TLR4 in the ileal of CLP mice promoted the depletion of 
Paneth cell and reduced LYZ and DEF-5 expression. Furthermore, our findings 
suggested that TLR4-mediated the hyperactivation of ER stress, via activating 
the ATF6/CHOP pathway, might be one of the mechanisms associated with Paneth 
cells loss and dysfunction during intestinal barrier impairment of sepsis.

In vitro assessment of pancreatic hormone secretion from isolated porcine 
islets.

Mourad NI(1), Xhema D(1), Gianello P(1).

The potential use of porcine islets for transplantation in humans has triggered 
interest in understanding porcine islet physiology. However, the number of 
studies dedicated to this topic has remained limited, as most islet 
physiologists prefer to use the less time-consuming rodent model or the more 
clinically relevant human islet. An often-overlooked aspect of pig islet 
physiology is its alpha cell activity and regulation of its glucagon secretion. 
In vitro islet perifusion is a reliable method to study the dynamics of hormone 
secretion in response to different stimuli. We thus used this method to quantify 
and study glucagon secretion from pig islets. Pancreatic islets were isolated 
from 20 neonatal (14 to 21-day old) and 5 adult (>2 years) pigs and cultured in 
appropriate media. Islet perifusion experiments were performed 8 to 10 days 
post-isolation for neonatal islets and 1 to 2 days post-isolation for adult 
islets. Insulin and glucagon were quantified in perifusion effluent fractions as 
well as in islet extracts by RIA. Increasing glucose concentration from 1 mM to 
15 mM markedly inhibited glucagon secretion independently of animal age. 
Interestingly, the effect of high glucose was more drastic on glucagon secretion 
compared to its effect on insulin secretion. In vivo, glucose injection during 
IVGTT initiated a quick (2-10 minutes) 3-fold decrease of plasmatic glucagon 
whereas the increase of plasmatic insulin took 20 minutes to become significant. 
These results suggest that regulation of glucagon secretion significantly 
contributes to glucose homeostasis in pigs and might compensate for the mild 
changes in insulin secretion in response to changes in glucose concentration.

Protein Binding in Translational Antimicrobial Development-Focus on Interspecies 
Differences.

Ahmed H(1), Bergmann F(1)(2), Zeitlinger M(1).

Plasma protein binding (PPB) continues to be a key aspect of antibiotic 
development and clinical use. PPB is essential to understand several properties 
of drug candidates, including antimicrobial activity, drug-drug interaction, 
drug clearance, volume of distribution, and therapeutic index. Focus areas of 
the review: In this review, we discuss the basics of PPB, including the main 
drug binding proteins i.e., Albumin and α-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG). 
Furthermore, we present the effects of PPB on the antimicrobial activity of 
antibiotics and the current role of PPB in in vitro pharmacodynamic (PD) models 
of antibiotics. Moreover, the effect of PPB on the PK/PD of antibiotics has been 
discussed in this review. A key aspect of this paper is a concise evaluation of 
PPB between animal species (dog, rat, mouse, rabbit and monkey) and humans. Our 
statistical analysis of the data available in the literature suggests a 
significant difference between antibiotic binding in humans and that of dogs or 
mice, with the majority of measurements from the pre-clinical species falling 
within five-fold of the human plasma value. Conversely, no significant 
difference in binding was found between humans and rats, rabbits, or monkeys. 
This information may be helpful for drug researchers to select the most relevant 
animal species in which the metabolism of a compound can be studied for 
extrapolating the results to humans. Furthermore, state-of-the-art methods for 
determining PPB such as equilibrium dialysis, ultracentrifugation, 
microdialysis, gel filtration, chromatographic methods and fluorescence 
spectroscopy are highlighted with their advantages and disadvantages.

Starch-Binding Domain Modulates the Specificity of Maltopentaose Production at 
Moderate Temperatures.

Ding N(1), Zhao B(2), Han X(1), Li C(3)(1)(4), Gu Z(3)(1)(4), Li Z(3)(1)(4).

Maltooligosaccharide-forming amylases (MFAs) hydrolyze starch into 
maltooligosaccharides with a defined degree of polymerization. However, the 
enzymatic mechanism underlying the product specificity remains partially 
understood. Here, we show that Saccharophagus degradans MFA (SdMFA) contains a 
noncatalytic starch-binding domain (SBD), which belongs to the 
carbohydrate-binding module family 20 and enables modulation of the product 
specificity. Removal of SBD from SdMFA resulted in a 3.5-fold lower production 
of the target maltopentaose. Conversely, appending SBD to another MFA from 
Bacillus megaterium improved the specificity for maltopentaose. SdMFA exhibited 
a higher level of exo-action and greater product specificity when reacting with 
amylopectin than with amylose. Our structural analysis and molecular dynamics 
simulation suggested that SBD could promote the recognition of nonreducing ends 
of substrates and delivery of the substrate chain to a groove end toward the 
active site in the catalytic domain. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a moderate 
temperature could mediate SBD to interact with the substrate with loose 
affinity, which facilitates the substrate to slide toward the active site. 
Together, our study reveals the structural and conditional bases for the 
specificity of MFAs, providing generalizable strategies to engineer MFAs and 
optimize the biosynthesis of maltooligosaccharides.

Effect of Probiotics Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus 
on Antibacterial Response Gene Transcription of Human Peripheral Monocytes.

Vale GC(1), Mota BIS(2), Ando-Suguimoto ES(3), Mayer MPA(3).

Periodontitis and related systemic inflammatory diseases are characterized by 
imbalanced ratio between pro- and anti-inflammatory factors. Probiotics may 
control inflammation by altering the inflammatory phenotype of defense cells. We 
aimed to evaluate the gene transcription of the antibacterial response of 
monocytes to exposure to probiotic lactobacilli. CD14 + monocytes were obtained 
by positive selection from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy 
donors (5 × 104 CD14 + /mL) and cultured with probiotic strains of 
Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus (LR-32) and Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA-5) at a 
1:10 multiplicity of infection in 24-well plates for 12 h. The gene expression 
analysis was performed by RT-qPCR using the Kit RT2 human antibacterial 
response, and in the supernatant, the cytokines were determined by ELISA. 
Tukey's post hoc test following an ANOVA with a p value of 5% was used for 
statistical analysis. Both probiotic strains increased the levels of cytokines 
TNF-α and CXCL-8 in the supernatant compared to the control of non-challenged 
cells (p < 0.05), but for IL-1Β and IL-6, this effect was observed only for LA-5 
(p < 0.05). The fold-regulation values for the following genes for LA-5 and 
LR-32 were, respectively, IL-12B (431.94 and 33.30), IL-1Β (76.73 and 17.14), 
TNF-α (94.63 and 2.49), CXCL-8 (89.59 and 4.18), and TLR-2 (49.68 and 3.40). 
Likewise, most of the other genes evaluated showed greater expression for LA-5 
compared to LR-32 (p < 0.05). The positive regulation of inflammatory factors 
such as IL-1β promoted by L. acidophilus LA-5 may increase the antibacterial 
activity of innate defense in periodontal tissues. However, this property may be 
deleterious by increasing inflammatory response.

Fibroblast Activation Protein Activates Macrophages and Promotes Parenchymal 
Liver Inflammation and Fibrosis.

Comment in
    Cell Mol Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2023;15(4):1018-1019.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is expressed on activated 
fibroblast. Its role in fibrosis and desmoplasia is controversial, and data on 
pharmacological FAP inhibition are lacking. We aimed to better define the role 
of FAP in liver fibrosis in vivo and in vitro.
METHODS: FAP expression was analyzed in mice and patients with fibrotic liver 
diseases of various etiologies. Fibrotic mice received a specific FAP inhibitor 
(FAPi) at 2 doses orally for 2 weeks during parenchymal fibrosis progression (6 
weeks of carbon tetrachloride) and regression (2 weeks off carbon 
tetrachloride), and with biliary fibrosis (Mdr2-/-). Recombinant FAP was added 
to (co-)cultures of hepatic stellate cells (HSC), fibroblasts, and macrophages. 
Fibrosis- and inflammation-related parameters were determined biochemically, by 
quantitative immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction, and 
transcriptomics.
RESULTS: FAP+ fibroblasts/HSCs were α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA)-negative and 
located at interfaces of fibrotic septa next to macrophages in murine and human 
livers. In parenchymal fibrosis, FAPi reduced collagen area, liver collagen 
content, α-SMA+ myofibroblasts, M2-type macrophages, serum alanine transaminase 
and aspartate aminotransferase, key fibrogenesis-related transcripts, and 
increased hepatocyte proliferation 10-fold. During regression, FAP was 
suppressed, and FAPi was ineffective. FAPi less potently inhibited biliary 
fibrosis. In vitro, FAP small interfering RNA reduced HSC α-SMA expression and 
collagen production, and FAPi suppressed their activation and proliferation. 
Compared with untreated macrophages, FAPi regulated macrophage profibrogenic 
activation and transcriptome, and their conditioned medium attenuated HSC 
activation, which was increased with addition of recombinant FAP.
CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacological FAP inhibition attenuates inflammation-predominant 
liver fibrosis. FAP is expressed on subsets of activated fibroblasts/HSC and 
promotes both macrophage and HSC profibrogenic activity in liver fibrosis.

In vivo anticoccidial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities of avocado 
fruit, Persea americana (Lauraceae), against Eimeria papillata infection.

Apicomplexan parasites, especially Eimeria sp., are the main intestinal murine 
pathogens, that lead to severe injuries to farm and domestic animals. Many 
anticoccidial drugs are available for coccidiosis, which, leads to the 
development of drug-resistant parasites. Recently, natural products are 
considered as an alternative agent to control coccidiosis. This study was 
designed to evaluate the anticoccidial activity of the Persea americana fruit 
extract (PAFE) in male C57BL/6 mice. A total of 35 male mice were divided into 
seven equal groups (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7). At day 0, all groups except the 
first group which served as uninfected-untreated control were infected orally 
with 1 × 103E. papillata sporulated oocysts. Group 2 served as 
uninfected-treated control. Group 3 was considered an infected-untreated group. 
After 60 min of infection, groups 4, 5, and 6 were treated with oral doses of 
PAFE aqueous methanolic extract (100, 300, and 500 mg/kg of body weight, 
respectively). Group 7 was treated with amprolium (a reference drug for 
coccidiosis). PAFE with 500 mg/kg, was the most effective dose, inducing a 
significant reduction in the output of oocysts in mice feces (by about 85.41%), 
accompanied by a significant decrease in the number of the developmental 
parasite stages and a significant elevation of the goblet cells in the jejunal 
tissues. Upon treatment, a significant change in the oxidative status due to E. 
papillata infection was observed, where the levels of glutathione (GSH) 
increased, while, levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) were 
decreased. In addition, the infection significantly upregulated the inflammatory 
cytokines of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and 
interferon-γ (IFN-γ). This increase in mRNA expression of IL-1β, TNF-α, and 
IFN-γ was about 8.3, 10.6, and 4.5-fold, respectively, which significantly 
downregulated upon treatment. Collectively, P. americana is a promising 
medicinal plant with anticoccidial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory 
activities and could be used for the treatment of coccidiosis.

Molecular Determinants of Species Specificity of α-Conotoxin TxIB towards Rat 
and Human α6/α3β4 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors.

Xie T(1), Qin Y(1), Zhao J(1), Dong J(1), Qi P(1), Zhang P(1), Zhangsun D(2), 
Zhu X(1), Yu J(1), Luo S(1)(2).

Conotoxins are widely distributed and important for studying ligand-gated ion 
channels. TxIB, a conotoxin consisting of 16 amino acids derived from Conus 
textile, is a unique selective ligand that blocks rat α6/α3β2β3 nAChR (IC50 = 28 
nM) without affecting other rat subtypes. However, when the activity of TxIB 
against human nAChRs was examined, it was unexpectedly found that TxIB had a 
significant blocking effect on not only human α6/α3β2β3 nAChR but also human 
α6/α3β4 nAChR, with an IC50 of 537 nM. To investigate the molecular mechanism of 
this species specificity and to establish a theoretical basis for drug 
development studies of TxIB and its analogs, different amino acid residues 
between human and rat α6/α3 and β4 nAChR subunits were identified. Each residue 
of the human species was then substituted with the corresponding residue of the 
rat species via PCR-directed mutagenesis. The potencies of TxIB towards the 
native α6/α3β4 nAChRs and their mutants were evaluated through 
electrophysiological experiments. The results showed that the IC50 of TxIB 
against h[α6V32L, K61R/α3]β4L107V, V115I was 22.5 μM, a 42-fold decrease in 
potency compared to the native hα6/α3β4 nAChR. Val-32 and Lys-61 in the human 
α6/α3 subunit and Leu-107 and Val-115 in the human β4 subunit, together, were 
found to determine the species differences in the α6/α3β4 nAChR. These results 
also demonstrate that the effects of species differences between humans and rats 
should be fully considered when evaluating the efficacy of drug candidates 
targeting nAChRs in rodent models.

The binding of intrinsically disordered proteins to globular ones can require 
the folding of motifs into α-helices. These interactions offer opportunities for 
therapeutic intervention but their modulation with small molecules is 
challenging because they bury large surfaces. Linear peptides that display the 
residues that are key for binding can be targeted to globular proteins when they 
form stable helices, which in most cases requires their chemical modification. 
Here we present rules to design peptides that fold into single α-helices by 
instead concatenating glutamine side chain to main chain hydrogen bonds recently 
discovered in polyglutamine helices. The resulting peptides are uncharged, 
contain only natural amino acids, and their sequences can be optimized to 
interact with specific targets. Our results provide design rules to obtain 
single α-helices for a wide range of applications in protein engineering and 
drug design.

Expression and single nucleotide polymorphisms of vitamin D receptor gene in 
cows with puerperal metritis in Egypt.

Saed HAR(1), Ibrahim HMM(2), Elgabry MA(3), El-Khodery SA(4).

The aim of this work is to study the expression profile of the vitamin D 
receptor (VDR), 1-α hydroxylase enzyme, and chemokine regulated on activation 
normal T-cell expressed and secreted genes (RANTES) genes in dairy cows with 
puerperal metritis, as well as to study the association between polymorphisms in 
the VDR gene and occurrence of such disease condition, which is considered a key 
to advances in the preventive medicine for such a problem in the future. Blood 
samples were collected from 60 dairy cows; from which 48 dairy cows proved to 
suffer puerperal metritis and other 12 apparently healthy recent parturient 
dairy cows were selected randomly for assessment the fold change variation in 
the expression profiles of the studied genes. Depending on the clinical 
examination, the normal cut-off point of the serum calcium, phosphorus, glucose, 
magnesium, potassium, sodium, and chloride, and the normal reference values of 
parathyroid hormone (PTH), 18 out of 48 dairy cows suffered puerperal metritis 
with a normal metabolic profile, which underwent further molecular analysis. In 
the studied dairy cows that suffered puerperal metritis with a normal metabolic 
profile, the expression pattern of the VDR and RANTES genes showed a significant 
up-regulation (P < 0.05), whereas the expression pattern of 1α-hydroxylase 
enzyme gene showed a significant down-regulation (P < 0.05) in comparison with 
those of healthy recent parturient dairy cows. The sequenced regions of the VDR 
gene (exon 7, partial intron 6, partial intron 7) didn't exhibit polymorphisms 
in their nucleotide sequence, and consecutively their amino acid sequence when 
compared to the published sequence on the gene bank. The results propose that 
the VDR gene (exon 7, partial intron 6, partial intron 7) polymorphisms do not 
play a role in the pathogenesis of puerperal metritis in dairy cows, excluding a 
role of the vitamin D in puerperal metritis.

Pomegranate Seed Oil as a Source of Conjugated Linolenic Acid (CLnA) Has No 
Effect on Atherosclerosis Development but Improves Lipid Profile and Affects the 
Expression of Lipid Metabolism Genes in apoE/LDLR(-/-) Mice.

Franczyk-Żarów M(1), Tarko T(2), Drahun-Misztal A(1), Czyzynska-Cichon I(3), Kus 
E(3), Kostogrys RB(1).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-atherosclerotic effect of 
pomegranate seed oil as a source of conjugated linolenic acid (CLnA) 
(cis-9,trans-11,cis-13; punicic acid) compared to linolenic acid (LnA) and 
conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) (cis-9,trans-11) in apoE/LDLR-/- mice. In the 
LONG experiment, 10-week old mice were fed for the 18 weeks. In the SHORT 
experiment, 18-week old mice were fed for the 10 weeks. Diets were supplied with 
seed oils equivalent to an amount of 0.5% of studied fatty acids. In the SHORT 
experiment, plasma TCh and LDL+VLDL cholesterol levels were significantly 
decreased in animals fed CLnA and CLA compared to the Control. The expression of 
PPARα in liver was four-fold increased in CLnA group in the SHORT experiment, 
and as a consequence the expression of its target gene ACO was three-fold 
increased, whereas the liver's expression of SREBP-1 and FAS were decreased in 
CLnA mice only in the LONG experiment. Punicic acid and CLA isomers were 
determined in the adipose tissue and liver in animals receiving pomegranate seed 
oil. In both experiments, there were no effects on the area of atherosclerotic 
plaque in aortic roots. However, in the SHORT experiment, the area of 
atherosclerosis in the entire aorta in the CLA group compared to CLnA and LnA 
was significantly decreased. In conclusion, CLnA improved the lipid profile and 
affected the lipid metabolism gene expression, but did not have the impact on 
the development of atherosclerotic plaque in apoE/LDLR-/- mice.

AMP-activated protein kinase alpha 2 (AMPKα2) regulates energy metabolism, 
protein synthesis, and glucolipid metabolism myocardial cells. Ketone bodies 
produced by fatty acid β-oxidation, especially β-hydroxybutyrate, are fatty 
energy-supplying substances for the heart, brain, and other organs during 
fasting and long-term exercise. They also regulate metabolic signaling for 
multiple cellular functions. Lysine β-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb) is a 
β-hydroxybutyrate-mediated protein posttranslational modification. Histone Kbhb 
has been identified in yeast, mouse, and human cells. However, whether AMPK 
regulates protein Kbhb is yet unclear. Hence, the present study explored the 
changes in proteomics and Kbhb modification omics in the hearts of AMPKα2 
knockout mice using a comprehensive quantitative proteomic analysis. Based on 
mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis, the number of 1181 Kbhb modified sites in 
455 proteins were quantified between AMPKα2 knockout mice and wildtype mice; 244 
Kbhb sites in 142 proteins decreased or increased after AMPKα2 knockout (fold 
change >1.5 or <1/1.5, p < 0.05). The regulation of Kbhb sites in 26 key enzymes 
of fatty acid degradation and tricarboxylic acid cycle was noted in AMPKα2 
knockout mouse cardiomyocytes. These findings, for the first time, identified 
proteomic features and Kbhb modification of cardiomyocytes after AMPKα2 
knockout, suggesting that AMPKα2 regulates energy metabolism by modifying 
protein Kbhb.

associations with colorectal adenoma.

An altered colonic microbiota probably increases colorectal adenoma (CRA) and 
cancer (CRC) risk, but large, unbiased fecal collections are needed to examine 
the relationship of gut microbiota diversity and composition to colorectal 
carcinogenesis. This study assessed whether fecal immunochemical tests (FITs) 
from CRA/CRC screening may fulfill this requirement. Using FIT, self-collected 
by members of Kaiser Permanente Hawaii (KPH), as well as interspersed quality 
control (QC) specimens, DNA was extracted and amplified to generate 16S rRNA 
microbiome profiles rarified at 10,000 reads. CRA/CRC were diagnosed by 
colonoscopy and histopathology. Covariates were from electronic KPH records. Of 
921 participants' FIT devices, 538 (58%) yielded at least 10,000 rRNA reads and 
1016 species-level variants mapped to 46 genera. Of the 538 evaluable 
participants, 63 (11.7%) were FIT-negative per protocol, and they were 
considered negative for CRA/CRC. Of the 475 FIT + participants, colonoscopy and 
pathologic review revealed that 8 (1.7%) had CRC, 71 (14.9%) had high-risk CRA, 
107 (22.5%) had low-risk CRA, and 289 (60.8%) did not have CRA/CRC. Men were 
2.27-fold [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.32-3.91] more likely than women to be 
FIT+ . Men also had 1.96-fold (CI 1.24-3.07) higher odds of low-risk CRA, with 
similar trends for high-risk CRA and CRC. CRA/CRC were not associated with 
overweight, obesity, diabetes, or antibiotic prescriptions in this study. QC 
analysis across 24 batches of FIT devices revealed QC outliers in four batches. 
With or without exclusion of the four QC-outlier batches, as well as lenient 
(1000-read) rarefaction, CRA/CRC had no consistent, statistically significant 
associations with fecal microbiome alpha diversity, beta diversity or genera 
relative abundance. CRA/CRC had expected associations with male sex but not with 
microbiome metrics. Fecal microbiome profiling using DNA extracted from at-home 
collected, re-used FIT devices is feasible, albeit with substantial challenges. 
Using FITs for prospective microbiome studies of CRA/CRC risk should consider 
the impact of the current findings on statistical power and requisite sample 
sizes.

Determinants of substrate specificity in a catalytically diverse family of 
acyl-ACP thioesterases from plants.

Kalinger RS(1), Rowland O(2).

BACKGROUND: ACYL-LIPID THIOESTERASES (ALTs) are a subclass of plastid-localized, 
fatty acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) thioesterase enzymes from plants. They 
belong to the single hot dog-fold protein family. ALT enzymes generate 
medium-chain (C6-C14) and C16 fatty acids, methylketone precursors (β-keto fatty 
acids), and 3-hydroxy fatty acids when expressed heterologously in E. coli. The 
diverse substrate chain-length and oxidation state preferences of ALTs set them 
apart from other plant acyl-ACP thioesterases, and ALTs show promise as 
metabolic engineering tools to produce high-value medium-chain fatty acids and 
methylketones in bacterial or plant systems. Here, we used a targeted 
motif-swapping approach to explore connections between ALT protein sequence and 
substrate specificity. Guided by comparative motif searches and computational 
modelling, we exchanged regions of amino acid sequence between ALT-type 
thioesterases from Arabidopsis thaliana, Medicago truncatula, and Zea mays to 
create chimeric ALT proteins.
RESULTS: Comparing the activity profiles of chimeric ALTs in E. coli to their 
wild-type counterparts led to the identification of interacting regions within 
the thioesterase domain that shape substrate specificity and enzyme activity. 
Notably, the presence of a 31-CQH[G/C]RH-36 motif on the central α-helix was 
shown to shift chain-length specificity towards 12-14 carbon chains, and to be a 
core determinant of substrate specificity in ALT-type thioesterases with 
preference for 12-14 carbon 3-hydroxyacyl- and β-ketoacyl-ACP substrates. For an 
ALT containing this motif to be functional, an additional 108-KXXA-111 motif and 
compatible sequence spanning aa77-93 of the surrounding β-sheet must also be 
present, demonstrating that interactions between residues in these regions of 
the catalytic domain are critical to thioesterase activity. The behaviour of 
chimeric enzymes in E. coli also indicated that aa77-93 play a significant role 
in dictating whether an ALT will prefer ≤10-carbon or ≥ 12-carbon acyl 
chain-lengths, and aa91-96 influence selectivity for substrates of fully or 
partially reduced oxidation states. Additionally, aa64-67 on the hot dog-fold 
β-sheet were shown to be important for enabling an ALT to act on 3-hydroxy fatty 
acyl-ACP substrates.
CONCLUSIONS: By revealing connections between thioesterase sequence and 
substrate specificity, this study is an advancement towards engineering 
recombinant ALTs with product profiles suited for specific applications.

Improvement of Fusel Alcohol Production by Engineering of the Yeast 
Branched-Chain Amino Acid Aminotransaminase.

Koonthongkaew J(1), Ploysongsri N(2), Toyokawa Y(1), Ruangpornvisuti V(2), 
Takagi H(1).

Branched-chain higher alcohols (BCHAs), or fusel alcohols, including isobutanol, 
isoamyl alcohol, and active amyl alcohol, are useful compounds in several 
industries. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae can synthesize these compounds 
via the metabolic pathways of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). Branched-chain 
amino acid aminotransaminases (BCATs) are the key enzymes for BCHA production 
via the Ehrlich pathway of BCAAs. BCATs catalyze a bidirectional transamination 
reaction between branched-chain α-keto acids (BCKAs) and BCAAs. In S. 
cerevisiae, there are two BCAT isoforms, Bat1 and Bat2, which are encoded by the 
genes BAT1 and BAT2. Although many studies have shown the effects of deletion or 
overexpression of BAT1 and BAT2 on BCHA production, there have been no reports 
on the enhancement of BCHA production by functional variants of BCATs. Here, to 
improve BCHA productivity, we designed variants of Bat1 and Bat2 with altered 
enzyme activity by using in silico computational analysis: the Gly333Ser and 
Gly333Trp Bat1 and corresponding Gly316Ser and Gly316Trp Bat2 variants, 
respectively. When expressed in S. cerevisiae cells, most of these variants 
caused a growth defect in minimal medium. Interestingly, the Gly333Trp Bat1 and 
Gly316Ser Bat2 variants achieved 18.7-fold and 17.4-fold increases in isobutanol 
above that for the wild-type enzyme, respectively. The enzyme assay revealed 
that the catalytic activities of all four BCAT variants were lower than that of 
the wild-type enzyme. Our results indicate that the decreased BCAT activity 
enhanced BCHA production by reducing BCAA biosynthesis, which occurs via a 
pathway that directly competes with BCHA production. IMPORTANCE Recently, 
several studies have attempted to increase the production of branched-chain 
higher alcohols (BCHAs) in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The key enzymes 
for BCHA biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae are the branched-chain amino acid 
aminotransaminases (BCATs) Bat1 and Bat2. Deletion or overexpression of the 
genes encoding BCATs has an impact on the production of BCHAs; however, amino 
acid substitution variants of Bat1 and Bat2 that could affect enzymatic 
properties-and ultimately BCHA productivity-have not been fully studied. By 
using in silico analysis, we designed variants of Bat1 and Bat2 and expressed 
them in yeast cells. We found that the engineered BCATs decreased catalytic 
activities and increased BCHA production. Our approach provides new insight into 
the functions of BCATs and will be useful in the future construction of enzymes 
optimized for high-level production of BCHAs.

The purpose of current study was to elucidate polyphenol tannic acid effect on 
renal function and activity of the renin-angiotensin system after unilateral 
ureteral obstruction (UUO). Male Wistar rats were divided into three groups of 
six randomly: 1) Sham, 2) UUO, and 3) UUO + Tannic acid. Rats in the UUO and 
UUO + Tannic acid groups experienced unilateral ureteral obstruction. In the 
Sham group, the abdominal cavity was exposed without UUO induction. In the 
UUO + Tannic acid group, animals received tannic acid (20 mg/kg) 
intraperitoneally, 6 and 12 h after clamping the left ureter and 6 and 12 h 
after the right nephrectomy. Blood samples were taken to measure blood urea 
nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. Kidney tissue samples were obtained for 
assessment of oxidative stress, inflammatory indices and the levels of 
renin-angiotensin system components. Tannic acid administration significantly 
improved UUO-induced kidney dysfunction (serum BUN: 66.42 ± 14.414 mg/dl, 
p < 0.05; serum creatinine: 1.67 ± 0.258 mg/dl, p < 0.05), oxidative stress (MDA 
level: 95.29 ± 37.35 µmol/g tissue, p < 0.05; SOD activity: 59.82 ± 13.41 U/g 
protein, p < 0.01) and inflammation (renal TNF-α: 57.05 ± 15.653 pg/g tissue, 
p < 0.05; renal IL-6: 117.015 ± 24.076 pg/g tissue, p < 0.001). The treatment 
caused a reduction in the amount of renal angiotensinogen, renin and ACE genes 
expression compared to the UUO group (Angiotensinogen: 8.9 ± onefold, p < 0.05, 
Renin: 6.5 ± 1.14 fold, p < 0.05, ACE: 4.9 ± 0.64 fold, p < 0.05). Angiotensin 
II type 1 receptor protein levels decreased in the tannic acid-treated rats in 
comparison with the UUO group (0.61 ± 0.136, p < 0.05). According to the result 
of the current study, tannic acid considerably attenuated the complications of 
unilateral ureteral obstruction through renin-angiotensin system modulation.

Aggrelyte-2 promotes protein solubility and decreases lens stiffness through 
lysine acetylation and disulfide reduction: Implications for treating 
presbyopia.

Panja S(1), Nahomi RB(1), Rankenberg J(1), Michel CR(2), Gaikwad H(2), Nam 
MH(1), Nagaraj RH(1)(2).

Aging proteins in the lens become increasingly aggregated and insoluble, 
contributing to presbyopia. In this study, we investigated the ability of 
aggrelyte-2 (N,S-diacetyl-L-cysteine methyl ester) to reverse the water 
insolubility of aged human lens proteins and to decrease stiffness in cultured 
human and mouse lenses. Water-insoluble proteins (WI) of aged human lenses 
(65-75 years) were incubated with aggrelyte-2 (500 μM) for 24 or 48 h. A control 
compound that lacked the S-acetyl group (aggrelyte-2C) was also tested. We 
observed 19%-30% solubility of WI upon treatment with aggrelyte-2. Aggrelyte-2C 
also increased protein solubility, but its effect was approximately 1.4-fold 
lower than that of aggrelyte-2. The protein thiol contents were 1.9- to 4.9-fold 
higher in the aggrelyte-2- and aggrelyte-2C-treated samples than in the 
untreated samples. The LC-MS/MS results showed Nε -acetyllysine (AcK) levels of 
1.5 to 2.1 nmol/mg protein and 0.6 to 0.9 nmol/mg protein in the aggrelyte-2- 
and aggrelyte-2C-treated samples. Mouse (C57BL/6J) lenses (incubated for 24 h) 
and human lenses (incubated for 72 h) with 1.0 mM aggrelyte-2 showed significant 
decreases in stiffness with simultaneous increases in soluble proteins (human 
lenses) and protein-AcK levels, and such changes were not observed in 
aggrelyte-2C-treated lenses. Mass spectrometry of the solubilized protein 
revealed AcK in all crystallins, but more was observed in α-crystallins. These 
results suggest that aggrelyte-2 increases protein solubility and decreases lens 
stiffness through acetylation and disulfide reduction. Aggrelyte-2 might be 
useful in treating presbyopia in humans.

Determining the expression levels of CSF-1 and OCT4, CREM-1, and protamine in 
testicular biopsies of adult Klinefelter patients: Their possible correlation 
with spermatogenesis.

Abofoul-Azab M(1)(2)(3), Lunenfeld E(4), Kleiman S(5)(6)(7), Barda S(5), Hauser 
R(5)(6)(7), Huleihel M(1)(2)(3).

Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is the most prevalent genetic disorder of infertile 
males. This study aimed to determine in Klinefelter patients (KS) the expression 
levels of spermatogenic markers and testicular growth factors that might predict 
spermatogenesis based on conventional testicular sperm extraction (TESE). The 
expression levels of the pre-meiotic (OCT4, CD9, GFR-α1, α-6-INTEGRIN, SALL4, 
C-KIT), meiotic (CREM-1), and post-meiotic (protamine) markers, as well as the 
colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) were examined in testicular biopsies with 
and without mature sperm of KS and normal karyotype of azoospermic patients 
(AZO) with complete spermatogenesis. In the biopsies of AZO, the expression 
levels (fold of expression compared to the PPI of the same sample) of OCT4 were 
9.68± 7.93, CREM 42.78± 28.22, CSF-1 3.07 ± 3.19, and protamine 
78498.12 ± 73214.40. Biopsies from KS included 7 with sperm and 17 without 
sperm. Among the biopsies with sperm, the expression levels of OCT4 were 
7.27± 9.29, CREM 3.13± 7.89, CSF-1 35.5 ± 48.01, and protamine 902.97 ± 2365.92. 
In 14 biopsies without sperm, we found low expression levels of OCT4, CREM and 
CSF-1, and no expression of protamine. However, in three of the biopsies without 
sperm that highly expressed OCT4 and CSF-1, the expression levels of CREM-1 and 
protamine were high. These results may be used for further consulting with 
patients considering repeating conventional TESE or micro TESE and 
cryopreservation for possible future in-vitro spermatogenesis.

Metabolic Profiling and Investigation of the Modulatory Effect of Fagonia 
cretica L. Aerial Parts on Hepatic CYP3A4 and UGT2B7 Enzymes in 
Streptozotocin-Induced Diabetic Model.

Drug-metabolizing enzymes are either boosted or suppressed by diabetes mellitus. 
This research was designed to explore Fagonia cretica L. aerial parts' impact on 
CYP3A4 and UGT2B7 activity and their mRNA expression in diabetic rats. Fagonia 
cretica (F. cretica) dried powder was sequentially extracted with n-hexane, 
chloroform, ethyl acetate, methanol, and water. The methanol extract and aqueous 
fraction presented the most significant potential to decrease the concentration 
of alpha-hydroxyl midazolam, with 176.0 ± 0.85 mg/Kg and 182.9 ± 0.99 mg/Kg, 
respectively, compared to the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic group, 
reflecting the inhibition in CYP3A4 activity. The fold change in mRNA expression 
of CYP3A4 was decreased significantly by the methanol extract, and the aqueous 
fraction of F. cretica estimated by 0.15 ± 0.002 and 0.16 ± 0.001, respectively, 
compared with the diabetic group. Morphine metabolism was significantly 
increased in rats treated with F. cretica methanol extract and its aqueous 
fraction, displaying 93.4 ± 0.96 mg/Kg and 96.4 ± 1.27 mg/Kg, respectively, 
compared with the metabolism of morphine in the diabetic group, which highlights 
the induction of UGT2B7 activity. The fold change in mRNA expression of UGT2B7 
was significantly increased by the methanol extract and the aqueous fraction, 
estimated at 8.14 ± 0.26 and 7.17 ± 0.23 respectively, compared to the diabetic 
group. Phytochemical analysis was performed using high-performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC), where the methanol extract showed more flavonoids and 
phenolic compounds compared to the aqueous fraction of F. cretica. The obtained 
results were further consolidated by molecular docking studies, where quercetin 
showed the best fitting within the active pocket of CYP3A4, followed by gallic 
acid, displaying free binding energies (∆G) of -30.83 and -23.12 kcal/mol, 
respectively. Thus, F. cretica could serve as a complementary medicine with 
standard anti-diabetic therapy that can modulate the activity of the 
drug-metabolizing enzymes.

Phonation Resistance Training Exercises (PhoRTE) With and Without Expiratory 
Muscle Strength Training (EMST) For Patients With Presbyphonia: A Noninferiority 
Randomized Clinical Trial.

Belsky MA(1), Shelly S(2), Rothenberger SD(3), Ziegler A(4), Hoffman B(5),

OBJECTIVES: Presbyphonia negatively impacts quality of life in patients with 
age-related voice changes. A proof-of-concept study showed promise for high 
vocal intensity exercise to treat presbyphonia, which became the basis for a 
novel intervention for age-related voice changes known as Phonation Resistance 
Training Exercises (PhoRTE). Expiratory Muscle Strength Training (EMST) has also 
been proposed as an additional intervention to target and strengthen the aging 
respiratory system; however, EMST has undergone limited evaluation as an adjunct 
treatment for elderly patients undergoing voice therapy for presbyphonia. This 
study determined if the addition of EMST to PhoRTE voice therapy (PhoRTE + EMST) 
is at least as effective at voice improvement as PhoRTE alone.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blinded, 
non-inferiority.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants aged 55 years or older with a diagnosis of 
vocal fold atrophy were randomized to complete PhoRTE therapy or PhoRTE + EMST. 
The primary outcome was change in Voice Handicap Index-10 (VHI-10). Secondary 
outcomes included the Aging Voice Index, maximum expiratory pressure, and 
acoustic and aerodynamic measures of voice. Repeated measures linear mixed 
models were constructed to analyze outcomes at a significance level of α = 0.10.
RESULTS: Twenty-six participants were recruited for the study, and 24 
participants were randomized to either treatment arm. Sixteen participants 
completed the entire study. Both treatment arms showed statistically significant 
and clinically meaningful improvements in VHI-10 (PhoRTE mean [M] = -8.20, P < 
0.001; PhoRTE + EMST M = -9.58, P < 0.001), and PhoRTE + EMST was noninferior to 
PhoRTE alone (P = 0.069). Both groups experienced a statistically significant 
pre-post treatment decrease (improvement) in AVI scores (PhoRTE M = -18.40, 
P = 0.004; PhoRTE + EMST M = -16.28, P = 0.005). PhoRTE+EMST had statistically 
significantly greater changes in maximum expiratory pressure compared to PhoRTE 
alone (PhoRTE M = 8.24 cm H2O, PhoRTE + EMST M = 32.63 cm H2O; P= 0.015). Some 
secondary acoustic and aerodynamic outcomes displayed trends toward improvement.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that voice therapy targeting high vocal 
intensity exercise (eg, PhoRTE) and EMST can play a role in improving voice 
outcomes for patients with presbyphonia.

BACKGROUND: Muscle wasting is a common complication of chronic kidney disease 
(CKD) that is associated with higher mortality. Although the mechanisms of 
myofibre loss in CKD has been widely studied, the contribution of muscle 
precursor cell (MPC) senescence remains poorly understood. Senescent MPCs no 
longer proliferate and can produce proinflammatory factors or cytokines. In this 
study, we tested the hypothesis that the senescence associated secretory 
phenotype (SASP) of MPCs contributes to CKD-induced muscle atrophy and weakness.
METHODS: CKD was induced in mice by 5/6th nephrectomy. Kidney function, muscle 
size, and function were measured, and markers of atrophy, inflammation, and 
senescence were evaluated using immunohistochemistry, immunoblots, or qPCR. To 
study the impact of senescence, a senolytics cocktail of dasatinib + quercetin 
(D&Q) was given orally to mice for 8 weeks. To investigate CKD-induced 
senescence at the cellular level, primary MPCs were incubated with serum from 
CKD or control subjects. The roles of specific proteins in MPC senescence were 
studied using adenoviral transduction, siRNA, and plasmid transfection.
RESULTS: In the hindlimb muscles of CKD mice, (i) the senescence biomarker 
SA-β-gal was sharply increased (~30-fold); (ii) the DNA damage response marker 
γ-H2AX was increased 1.9-fold; and (iii) the senescence pathway markers p21 and 
p16INK4a were increased 1.99-fold and 2.82-fold, respectively (all values, 
P < 0.05), whereas p53 was unchanged. γ-H2AX, p21, and p16INK4A were negatively 
correlated at P < 0.05 with gastrocnemius weight, suggesting a causal 
relationship with muscle atrophy. Administration of the senolytics cocktail to 
CKD mice for 8 weeks eliminated the disease-related elevation of p21, p16INK4a , 
and γ-H2AX, abolished positive SA-β-gal, and depressed the high levels of the 
SASP cytokines, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and IFN (all values, P < 0.05). Skeletal 
muscle weight, myofibre cross-sectional area, and grip function were improved in 
CKD mice receiving D&Q. Markers of protein degradation, inflammation, and MPCs 
dysfunction were also attenuated by D&Q treatment compared with the vehicle 
treatment in 5/6th nephrectomy mice (all values, P < 0.05). Uraemic serum 
induced senescence in cultured MPCs. Overexpression of FoxO1a in MPCs increased 
the number of p21+ senescent cells, and p21 siRNA prevented uraemic 
serum-induced senescence (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Senescent MPCs are likely to contribute to the development of 
muscle wasting during CKD by producing inflammatory cytokines. Limiting 
senescence with senolytics ameliorated muscle wasting and improved muscle 
strength in vivo and restored cultured MPC functions. These results suggest 
potential new therapeutic targets to improve muscle health and function in CKD.

airways.

INTRODUCTION: Lipid nanoparticles (LNP) have been successfully used as a 
platform technology for delivering nucleic acids to the liver. To broaden the 
application of LNPs in targeting non-hepatic tissues, we developed LNP-based RNA 
therapies (siRNA or mRNA) for the respiratory tract. Such optimized LNP systems 
could offer an early treatment strategy for viral respiratory tract infections 
such as COVID-19.
METHODS: We generated a small library of six LNP formulations with varying 
helper lipid compositions and characterized their hydrodynamic diameter, size 
distribution and cargo entrapment properties. Next, we screened these LNP 
formulations for particle uptake and evaluated their potential for transfecting 
mRNA encoding green fluorescence protein (GFP) or SARS-CoV2 nucleocapsid-GFP 
fusion reporter gene in a human airway epithelial cell line in vitro. Following 
LNP-siGFP delivery, GFP protein knockdown efficiency was assessed by flow 
cytometry to determine %GFP+ cells and median fluorescence intensity (MFI) for 
GFP. Finally, lead LNP candidates were validated in Friend leukemia virus B 
(FVB) male mice via intranasal delivery of an mRNA encoding luciferase, using in 
vivo bioluminescence imaging.
RESULTS: Dynamic light scattering revealed that all LNP formulations contained 
particles with an average diameter of <100 nm and a polydispersity index of 
<0.2. Human airway epithelial cell lines in culture internalized LNPs with 
differential GFP transfection efficiencies (73-97%). The lead formulation LNP6 
entrapping GFP or Nuc-GFP mRNA demonstrated the highest transfection efficiency 
(97%). Administration of LNP-GFP siRNA resulted in a significant reduction of 
GFP protein expression. For in vivo studies, intranasal delivery of LNPs 
containing helper lipids (DSPC, DOPC, ESM or DOPS) with luciferase mRNA showed 
significant increase in luminescence expression in nasal cavity and lungs by at 
least 10 times above baseline control.
CONCLUSION: LNP formulations enable the delivery of RNA payloads into human 
airway epithelial cells, and in the murine respiratory system; they can be 
delivered to nasal mucosa and lower respiratory tract via intranasal delivery. 
The composition of helper lipids in LNPs crucially modulates transfection 
efficiencies in airway epithelia, highlighting their importance in effective 
delivery of therapeutic products for airways diseases.

Integrated Bioluminescent Immunoassays for High-Throughput Sampling and 
Continuous Monitoring of Cytokines.

M(1)(2).

Immunoassays show great potential for the detection of low levels of cytokines, 
due to their high sensitivity and excellent specificity. There is a particular 
demand for biosensors that enable both high-throughput screening and continuous 
monitoring of clinically relevant cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and 
tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα). To this end, we here introduce a novel 
bioluminescent immunoassay based on the ratiometric plug-and-play 
immunodiagnostics (RAPPID) platform, with an improved intrinsic 
signal-to-background and an >80-fold increase in the luminescent signal. The new 
dRAPPID assay, comprising a dimeric protein G adapter connected via a 
semiflexible linker, was applied to detect the secretion of IL-6 by breast 
carcinoma cells upon TNFα stimulation and the production of low concentrations 
of IL-6 (∼18 pM) in an endotoxin-stimulated human 3D muscle tissue model. 
Moreover, we integrated the dRAPPID assay in a newly developed microfluidic 
device for the simultaneous and continuous monitoring of changes in IL-6 and 
TNFα in the low-nanomolar range. The luminescence-based read-out and the 
homogeneous nature of the dRAPPID platform allowed for detection with a simple 
measurement setup, consisting of a digital camera and a light-sealed box. This 
permits the usage of the continuous dRAPPID monitoring chip at the point of 
need, without the requirement for complex or expensive detection techniques.

Is microbial adhesion affected by the build orientation of a 3-dimensionally 
printed denture base resin?

Yacob N(1), Ahmad NA(2), Safii SH(3), Yunus N(4), Abdul Razak F(5).

STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: How the build orientation of a 3-dimensionally (3D) 
printed denture affects microbial adhesion is unclear.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the adherence of 
Streptococcus spp. and Candida spp. on 3D-printed denture bases prepared at 
different build orientations with conventional heat-polymerized resin.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Resin specimens (n=5) with standardized 28.3 mm2 surface 
area were 3D printed at 0 and 60 degrees, and heat-polymerized (3DP-0, 3DP-60, 
and HP, respectively). The specimens were placed in a Nordini artificial mouth 
(NAM) model and exposed to 2 mL of clarified whole saliva to create a 
pellicle-coated substratum. Suspensions of Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus 
sanguinis, Candida albicans and Candida glabrata, and a mixed species, each at 
108 cfu/mL were pumped separately into the model for 24 hours to promote 
microbial adhesion. The resin specimens were then removed, placed in fresh 
media, and sonicated to dislodge attached microbes. Each suspension (100 μL) was 
aliquoted and spread on agar plates for colony counting. The resin specimens 
were also examined under a scanning electron microscope. The interaction between 
types of specimen and groups of microbes was examined with 2-way ANOVA and then 
further analysis with Tukey honest significant test and Kruskal-Wallis post hoc 
tests (α=.05).
RESULTS: A significant interaction was observed between the 3DP-0, 3DP-60, and 
HP specimen types and the groups of microbes adhering to the corresponding 
denture resin specimens (P<.05). The difference was statistically significant 
among 3DP-0, 3DP-60, and HP specimens (P<.05). The adherence of candida was 
3.98-times lower on the 3DP-0 than that of HP (P<.05). However, adherence of the 
mixed-species microbes and streptococci on the 3DP-60 were 1.75 times and 2-fold 
higher, respectively (P<.05). The scanning electron micrographs showed that 
3DP-0 exhibited the lowest microbial adherence compared with HP and 3DP-60.
CONCLUSIONS: Adherence affinity of denture base resin is affected by the build 
orientation rather than by the group of different microbes. Three-dimensionally 
printed denture base resin fabricated at a 0-degree build orientation exhibited 
low affinity for microbial adhesion. Three-dimensionally printed dentures may 
reduce microbial adhesion when printed at a 0-degree build orientation.

Deep learning neural network image analysis of immunohistochemical protein 
expression reveals a significantly reduced expression of biglycan in breast 
cancer.

Thiesen AP(1), Mielczarski B(2), Savaris RF(1)(2).

New breast cancer biomarkers have been sought for better tumor characterization 
and treatment. Among these putative markers, there is Biglycan (BGN). BGN is a 
class I small leucine-rich proteoglycan family of proteins characterized by a 
protein core with leucine-rich repeats. The objective of this study is to 
compare the protein expression of BGN in breast tissue with and without cancer, 
using immunohistochemical technique associated with digital histological score 
(D-HScore) and supervised deep learning neural networks (SDLNN). In this 
case-control study, 24 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were obtained 
for analysis. Normal (n = 9) and cancerous (n = 15) tissue sections were 
analyzed by immunohistochemistry using BGN monoclonal antibody (M01-Abnova) and 
3,3'-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) as the chromogen. Photomicrographs of the slides 
were analysed with D-HScore, using arbitrary DAB units. Another set (n = 129) 
with higher magnification without ROI selection, was submitted to the 
inceptionV3 deep neural network image embedding recognition model. Next, 
supervised neural network analysis, using stratified 20 fold cross validation, 
with 200 hidden layers, ReLu activation, and regularization at α = 0.0001 were 
applied for SDLNN. The sample size was calculated for a minimum of 7 cases and 7 
controls, having a power = 90%, an α error = 5%, and a standard deviation of 20, 
to identify a decrease from the average of 40 DAB units (control) to 4 DAB units 
in cancer. BGN expression in DAB units [median (range)] was 6.2 (0.8 to 12.4) 
and 27.31 (5.3 to 81.7) in cancer and normal breast tissue, respectively, using 
D-HScore (p = 0.0017, Mann-Whitney test). SDLNN classification accuracy was 
85.3% (110 out of 129; 95%CI = 78.1% to 90.3%). BGN protein expression is 
reduced in breast cancer tissue, compared to normal tissue.

Washing-free electrogenerated chemiluminescence magnetic microbiosensors based 
on target assistant proximity hybridization for multiple protein biomarkers.

Wei Y(1), Zhang J(1), Yang X(1), Wang Z(1), Wang J(1), Qi H(2), Gao Q(1), Zhang 
C(3).

This work reports washing-free electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) magnetic 
microbiosensors based on target assistant proximity hybridization (TAPH) for 
multiple protein biomarkers for the first time. As a principle-of-proof, 
alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was chosen as a model analyte, and biotin-DNA1 bound 
streptavidin-coated magnetic microbeads (MMB@SA⋅biotin-DNA1) were designed as 
the universal capture MMB, while the corresponding two antibodies tagged with 
DNA2 or DNA3 were utilized as hybrid recognition probes, and ruthenium 
complex-tagged DNA4-10A was designed as a universal ECL signal probe. When the 
capture MMB was added into the mixture solution (containing the analyte, hybrid 
recognition probes, signal probe and tri-n-propylamine), biocomplexes were 
formed on the MMB. After the resulting MMB was efficiently brought to the 
surface of a magnetic glassy carbon electrode (MGCE), ECL measurement was 
performed without a washing step, resulting in an increase in the ECL intensity. 
A model for ECL measuring the second-order rate constants of hybridization 
reactions on MMB was derived. It was found that the rate constants for 
hybridization reactions on MMB in rotating mode are 1.6-fold higher than those 
in shaking mode, and a suitable DNA length of the signal probe can improve the 
signal-to-noise ratio. The washing-free ECL method was developed for the 
determination of AFP with a much lower detection limit (LOD) of 0.04 ng mL-1. 
The developed flexible strategy has been extended to determine D-dimer with an 
LOD of 0.1 ng mL-1 and myoglobinglobin with an LOD of 1.1 ng mL-1. This work 
demonstrated that the proposed strategy of ECL TAPH on MMB at MGCE is a 
washing-free and flexible promising strategy, and can be extended to qualify 
other multiple protein biomarkers in real clinical assays.

Hollow Octadecameric Self-Assembly of Collagen-like Peptides.

Yu LT(1), Hancu MC(1), Kreutzberger MAB(2), Henrickson A(3), Demeler B(3)(4), 
Egelman EH(2), Hartgerink JD(1)(5).

The folding of collagen is a hierarchical process that starts with three 
peptides associating into the characteristic triple helical fold. Depending on 
the specific collagen in question, these triple helices then assemble into 
bundles reminiscent of α-helical coiled-coils. Unlike α-helices, however, the 
bundling of collagen triple helices is very poorly understood with almost no 
direct experimental data available. In order to shed light on this critical step 
of collagen hierarchical assembly, we have examined the collagenous region of 
complement component 1q. Thirteen synthetic peptides were prepared to dissect 
the critical regions allowing for its octadecameric self-assembly. We find that 
short peptides (under 40 amino acids) are able to self-assemble into specific 
(ABC)6 octadecamers. This requires the ABC heterotrimeric composition as the 
self-assembly subunit, but does not require disulfide bonds. Self-assembly into 
this octadecamer is aided by short noncollagenous sequences at the N-terminus, 
although they are not entirely required. The mechanism of self-assembly appears 
to begin with the very slow formation of the ABC heterotrimeric helix, followed 
by rapid bundling of triple helices into progressively larger oligomers, 
terminating in the formation of the (ABC)6 octadecamer. Cryo-electron microscopy 
reveals the (ABC)6 assembly as a remarkable, hollow, crown-like structure with 
an open channel approximately 18 Å at the narrow end and 30 Å at the wide end. 
This work helps to illuminate the structure and assembly mechanism of a critical 
protein in the innate immune system and lays the groundwork for the de novo 
design of higher order collagen mimetic peptide assemblies.

Reactive Centre Loop Mutagenesis of SerpinB3 to Target TMPRSS2 and Furin: 
Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Cell Entry and Replication.

Singh S(1), O'Reilly S(2), Gewaid H(3), Bowie AG(3), Gautier V(2), Worrall 
DM(1).

The SARS-CoV-2 virus can utilize host cell proteases to facilitate cell entry, 
whereby the Spike (S) protein is cleaved at two specific sites to enable 
membrane fusion. Furin, transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), and cathepsin 
L (CatL) are the major proteases implicated, and are thus targets for anti-viral 
therapy. The human serpin (serine protease inhibitor) alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) 
shows inhibitory activity for TMPRSS2, and has previously been found to suppress 
cell infection with SARS-CoV-2. Here, we have generated modified serpin 
inhibitors with increased specificity for these cellular proteases. Using 
SerpinB3 (SCCA-1), a cross-class inhibitor of CatL, as a scaffold, we have 
designed and produced reactive centre loop (RCL) variants to more specifically 
target both furin and TMPRSS2. Two further variants were generated by 
substituting the RCL P7-P1 with the spike protein S1/S2 cleavage site from 
either SARS-CoV-2 alpha or delta (P681R) sequences. Altered inhibitory 
specificity of purified recombinant proteins was verified in protease assays, 
with attenuated CatL inhibition and gain of furin or TMPRSS2 inhibition, as 
predicted, and modified serpins were shown to block S protein cleavage in vitro. 
Furthermore, the serpin variants were able to inhibit S-pseudoparticle entry 
into A549-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells and suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 
cells expressing TMPRSS2. The construct designed to inhibit TMPRSS2 (B3-TMP) was 
most potent. It was more effective than A1AT for TMPRSS2 enzyme inhibition (with 
an eighteen-fold improvement in the second order inhibition rate constant) and 
for blocking SARS-CoV-2 viral replication. These findings advance the potential 
for serpin RCL mutagenesis to generate new inhibitors, and may lead to novel 
anti-viral biological molecules.

Older Age and High α-Fetoprotein Predict Higher Risk of Hepatocellular Carcinoma 
in Chronic Hepatitis-B-Related Cirrhotic Patients Receiving Long-Term 
Nucleos(t)ide Analogue Therapy.

Liu YY(1), Lin CL(1)(2), Weng CH(2)(3), Chang PH(2)(4), Chien CH(1), Huang 
KC(1), Hua MC(2)(5), Hu CC(1)(2).

Background: Nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUCs) were proved to reduce hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) development in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, but data were 
limited on their efficacy in cirrhotic CHB patients. Methods: A total of 447 
cirrhotic CHB patients treated with tenofovir/entecavir were retrospectively 
analyzed and divided into HCC (n = 48) and non-HCC (n = 399) groups. The median 
follow-up period was 62.1 months. Results: A total of 48 patients (10.7%) 
developed HCC during surveillance. The annual incidence rate of HCC was 2.04 per 
100 person-years. The cumulative incidence of HCC was 0.9%, 9.8%, and 22.1% at 
1, 5, and 10 years, respectively. Significant predictors for HCC identified 
using a multiple Cox regression analysis were age ≥50 years (hazard ratio (HR): 
2.34) and α-fetoprotein (AFP) ≥8 ng/mL (HR: 2.05). The incidence rate of HCC was 
8.67-fold higher in patients with age ≥50 years and AFP ≥8 ng/mL (3.14 per 100 
person-years) than those with age <50 years and AFP <8 ng/mL (0.36 per 100 
person-years). Conclusions: Cirrhotic CHB patients with age <50 years and AFP <8 
ng/mL had the lowest annual incidence of HCC. However, those with age ≥50 years 
or/and AFP ≥8 ng/mL had a significantly higher risk for HCC development and 
warrant a careful surveillance schedule.

Crystal structure and sugar-binding ability of the C-terminal domain of 
N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase IV establish a new carbohydrate-binding module 
family.

Oka N(1), Mori S(1), Ikegaya M(2), Park EY(1)(2)(3), Miyazaki T(1)(2)(3).

N-glycans are modified by glycosyltransferases in the endoplasmic reticulum and 
Golgi apparatus. N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase IV (GnT-IV) is a 
Golgi-localized glycosyltransferase that synthesizes complex-type N-glycans in 
vertebrates. This enzyme attaches N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to the 
α-1,3-linked mannose branch of the N-glycan core structure via a β-1,4 linkage. 
Deficiency of this enzyme is known to cause abnormal cellular functions, making 
it a vital enzyme for living organisms. However, there has been no report on its 
3-dimensional structure to date. Here, we demonstrated that the C-terminal 
regions (named CBML) of human GnT-IVa and Bombyx mori ortholog have the ability 
to bind β-N-acetylglucosamine. In addition, we determined the crystal structures 
of human CBML, B. mori CBML, and its complex with β-GlcNAc at 1.97, 1.47, and 
1.15 Å resolutions, respectively, and showed that they adopt a β-sandwich fold, 
similar to carbohydrate-binding module family 32 (CBM32) proteins. The regions 
homologous to CBML (≥24% identity) were found in GnT-IV isozymes, GnT-IVb, and 
GnT-IVc (known as GnT-VI), and the structure of B. mori CBML in complex with 
β-GlcNAc indicated that the GlcNAc-binding residues were highly conserved among 
these isozymes. These residues are also conserved with the GlcNAc-binding CBM32 
domain of β-N-acetylhexosaminidase NagH from Clostridium perfringens despite the 
low sequence identity (<20%). Taken together with the phylogenetic analysis, 
these findings indicate that these CBMLs may be novel CBM family proteins with 
GlcNAc-binding ability.

The MAP2K2 Gene as Potential Diagnostic Marker in Monitoring Adalimumab Therapy 
of Psoriatic Arthritis.

Krawczyk A(1), Strzałka-Mrozik B(2), Juszczyk K(2), Kimsa-Dudek M(1), 
Wcisło-Dziadecka D(3), Gola J(2).

BACKGROUND: MAP kinases are some of the cascades that are specialized in the 
cell's response to external stimuli. Their impaired functioning can be observed 
during the course of psoriatic arthritis. Currently, the best-known class of 
biological drugs is the inhibitors of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α, 
including adalimumab.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess changes in the expression of MAP 
kinase genes in patients with psoriatic arthritis treated with adalimumab, as 
well as to determine which of the analyzed transcripts could be used as a 
diagnostic or therapeutic target.
METHODS: An analysis was performed on the total RNA extracted from PBMCs of 
patients with psoriatic arthritis before and after three months of adalimumab 
therapy as well as from a control group. Changes in the expression of the 
mitogen-activated protein kinase genes were assessed using the HG-U133A 2.0 
oligonucleotide microarray method, while the obtained results were validated 
using the real-time RT-qPCR method.
RESULTS: Using the oligonucleotide microarray method, 14 genes coded for 
proteins from the MAPK group were identified with at least a two-fold change of 
expression in the control group and during adalimumab therapy. Validation of the 
results confirmed a statistically significant decrease in the transcriptional 
activity of the MAP2K2 gene in the group of patients three months after the 
administration of adalimumab relative to the control group.
CONCLUSION: Adalimumab therapy alters the expression of MAPK-coding genes. The 
assessment of the number of MAP2K2 mRNA molecules can potentially be used in 
diagnostic analyses or in monitoring adalimumab therapy.

Layer-specific distribution and expression pattern of AMPA- and NMDA-type 
glutamate receptors in the barrel field of the adult rat somatosensory cortex: a 
quantitative electron microscopic analysis.

Rollenhagen A(1), Anstötz M(1)(2), Zimmermann K(1), Kasugai Y(3), Sätzler K(4), 
Molnar E(5), Ferraguti F(3), Lübke JHR(1)(6)(7).

AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) and NMDA 
(N-methyl-d-aspartate) glutamate receptors are driving forces for synaptic 
transmission and plasticity at neocortical synapses. However, their distribution 
pattern in the adult rat neocortex is largely unknown and was quantified using 
freeze fracture replication combined with postimmunogold-labeling. Both 
receptors were co-localized at layer (L)4 and L5 postsynaptic densities (PSDs). 
At L4 dendritic shaft and spine PSDs, the number of gold grains detecting AMPA 
was similar, whereas at L5 shaft PSDs AMPA-receptors outnumbered those on spine 
PSDs. Their number was significantly higher at L5 vs. L4 PSDs. At L4 and L5 
dendritic shaft PSDs, the number of gold grains detecting GluN1 was ~2-fold 
higher than at spine PSDs. The number of gold grains detecting the GluN1-subunit 
was higher for both shaft and spine PSDs in L5 vs. L4. Both receptors showed a 
large variability in L4 and L5. A high correlation between the number of gold 
grains and PSD size for both receptors and targets was observed. Both receptors 
were distributed over the entire PSD but showed a layer- and target-specific 
distribution pattern. The layer- and target-specific distribution of AMPA and 
GluN1 glutamate receptors partially contribute to the observed functional 
differences in synaptic transmission and plasticity in the neocortex.

Alterations in Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Peptide Levels in Patients with 
HIV.

Chronic HIV infection has long been associated with an increased risk for 
cardiovascular diseases. The metabolites of the renin−angiotensin system (RAS) 
such as angiotensin II (AngII) play an important role in regulating blood 
pressure and fluid dynamics. Cross-sectional analysis of HIV-positive 
individuals (n = 71, age > 40 years, stable ART > 3 months with HIV viral load < 
50 copies/mL) were compared to a similar HIV seronegative group (n = 72). 
High-resolution B-mode ultrasound images of the right carotid bifurcation (RBIF) 
and right common carotid artery (RCCA) were conducted to measure the extent of 
carotid atherosclerotic vascular disease. Plasma RAS peptide levels were 
quantified using a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics 
assay. RAS peptide concentrations were compared between persons with HIV and 
persons without HIV, correlating their association with clinical and cardiac 
measures. Median precursor peptides (Ang(1-12) and AngI) were significantly 
higher in the HIV-positive group compared to the HIV-negative. Analyses of the 
patient subgroup not on antihypertensive medication revealed circulating levels 
of AngII to be four-fold higher in the HIV-positive subgroup. AngII and 
TNF-alpha levels were found to have a positive association with RCCA, and 
AngI/Ang(1-12) ratio and TNF-alpha levels were found to have a positive 
association with RBIF. In both predictive models, AngIII had a negative 
association with either RCCA or RBIF, which may be attributed to its ability to 
bind onto AT2R and thus oppose pro-inflammatory events. These results reveal 
systemic alterations in RAS as a result of chronic HIV infection, which may lead 
to the activation of inflammatory pathways associated with carotid thickening. 
RAS peptide levels and cytokine markers were associated with RCCA and RBIF 
measurements.

A(3), Pastor K(1), Jokić S(4), Vidović S(1).

To study the efficiency of two green-based extraction techniques for the 
isolation of bioactive constituents from black elderberry press cake, changes in 
phenolic compounds and main anthocyanin contents were analyzed. Polyphenolic 
content was correlated with antioxidant and antidiabetic potential by 
radical-scavenging activity and monitoring of α-amylase inhibition. Black 
elderberry press-cake extracts were obtained by ultrasound-assisted (UAE) and 
microwave-assisted (MAE) extractions under different extraction conditions. 
High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis revealed that 
cyanidin-3-sambubioside and cyanidin-3-glucoside were the principal anthocyanins 
in all the obtained extracts, with their content being highest in MAE obtained 
at 80 °C over 5 min. The same extract induced two-fold higher antioxidant 
activity (IC50 6.89 μg/mL) and α-amylase inhibitory potential (IC50 2.18 mg/mL) 
in comparison to UAE extracts. The main compositional differences between 
extracts obtained by the same extraction technique were assigned to the 
extraction temperature. A principal component analysis confirmed that the 
antidiabetic feature is to be attributed to the rich content of anthocyanins in 
black elderberry press cake. Our results indicate the great potential of 
underutilized black elderberry press cake for the development of novel food and 
herbal formulations due to notable anthocyanin contents highly correlated with 
antidiabetic activity.

Design and Development of Benzothiazole-Based Fluorescent Probes for Selective 
Detection of Aβ Aggregates in Alzheimer's Disease.

Mallesh R(1)(2)(3), Khan J(1)(2), Pradhan K(2), Roy R(1), Jana NR(4), Jaisankar 
P(2), Ghosh S(1)(2)(3).

The formation and accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide are considered the 
crucial events that are responsible for the progression of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). Herein, we have designed and synthesized a series of fluorescent probes by 
using electron acceptor-donor end groups interacting with a π-conjugating system 
for the detection of Aβ aggregates. The chemical structure of these probes 
denoted as RMs, having a conjugated π-system (C═C), showed a maximum emission in 
PBS (>600 nm), which is the best range for a fluorescent imaging probe. Among 
all these probes, RM-28 showed an excellent fluorescence property with an 
emission maximum of >598 nm upon binding to Aβ aggregates. RM-28 also showed 
high sensitivity (7.5-fold) and high affinities toward Aβ aggregates (Kd = 
175.69 ± 4.8 nM; Ka = 0.5 × 107 M-1). It can cross the blood-brain barrier of 
mice efficiently. The affinity of RM-28 toward Aβ aggregates was observed in 
3xTg-AD brain sections of the hippocampus and cortex region using a fluorescent 
imaging technique, as well as an in vitro fluorescence-based binding assay with 
Aβ aggregates. Moreover, RM-28 is highly specific to Aβ aggregates and does not 
bind with intracellular proteins like bovine serum albumin (BSA) and α-synuclein 
(α-Syn) aggregates. The results indicate that the probe RM-28 emerges as an 
efficient and veritable highly specific fluorescent probe for the detection of 
Aβ aggregates in both in vitro and in vivo model systems.

Enhancing (223)Ra Treatment Efficacy by Anti-β1 Integrin Targeting.

Paindelli C(1)(2), Casarin S(3), Wang F(4), Diaz-Gomez L(5), Zhang J(4), Mikos 
AG(5), Logothetis CJ(1), Friedl P(1)(2)(6), Dondossola E(7).

223Ra is an α-emitter approved for the treatment of bone metastatic prostate 
cancer (PCa), which exerts direct cytotoxicity toward PCa cells near the bone 
interface, whereas cells positioned in the core respond poorly because of short 
α-particle penetrance. β1 integrin (β1I) interference has been shown to increase 
radiosensitivity and significantly enhance external-beam radiation efficiency. 
We hypothesized that targeting β1I would improve 223Ra outcome. Methods: We 
tested the effect of combining 223Ra and anti-β1I antibody treatment in PC3 and 
C4-2B PCa cell models expressing high and low β1I levels, respectively. In vivo 
tumor growth was evaluated through bioluminescence. Cellular and molecular 
determinants of response were analyzed by ex vivo 3-dimensional imaging of bone 
lesions and by proteomic analysis and were further confirmed by computational 
modeling and in vitro functional analysis in tissue-engineered bone mimetic 
systems. Results: Interference with β1I combined with 223Ra reduced PC3 cell 
growth in bone and significantly improved overall mouse survival, whereas no 
change was achieved in C4-2B tumors. Anti-β1I treatment decreased the PC3 tumor 
cell mitosis index and spatially expanded 223Ra lethal effects 2-fold, in vivo 
and in silico. Regression was paralleled by decreased expression of 
radioresistance mediators. Conclusion: Targeting β1I significantly improves 
223Ra outcome and points toward combinatorial application in PCa tumors with 
high β1I expression.

Improved Understanding of the Inflammatory Response in Synovial Fluid and Serum 
after Traumatic Knee Injury, Excluding Fractures of the Knee: A Systematic 
Review.

Nieboer MF(1), Reijman M(1), Wesdorp MA(1), Bastiaansen-Jenniskens YM(1), 
Meuffels DE(1).

BACKGROUND: Traumatic knee injury results in a 4- to 10-fold increased risk of 
post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). Currently, there are no successful 
interventions for preventing PTOA after knee injury. The aim of this study is to 
identify inflammatory proteins that are increased in serum and synovial fluid 
after acute knee injury, excluding intra-articular fractures.
METHODS: A literature search was done according to the PRISMA guidelines. 
Articles reporting about inflammatory proteins after knee injury, except 
fractures, up to December 8, 2021 were collected. Inclusion criteria were as 
follows: patients younger than 45 years, no radiographic signs of knee 
osteoarthritis at baseline, and inflammatory protein measurement within 1 year 
after trauma. Risk of bias was assessed of the included studies. The level of 
evidence was determined by the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy.
RESULTS: Ten studies were included. All included studies used a healthy control 
group or the contralateral knee as healthy control. Strong evidence for 
interleukin 6 (IL-6) and limited evidence for CCL4 show elevated concentrations 
of these proteins in synovial fluid (SF) after acute knee injury; no 
upregulation in SF for IL-2, IL-10, CCL3, CCL5, CCL11, granulocyte 
colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating 
factor (GM-CSF) was found. Limited evidence was found for no difference in serum 
concentration of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, CCL2, and tumor necrosis factor alpha 
(TNF-α) after knee injury.
CONCLUSION: Interleukin 6 and CCL4 are elevated in SF after acute knee injury. 
Included studies failed to demonstrate increased concentration of inflammatory 
proteins in SF samples taken 6 weeks after trauma. Future research should focus 
on SF inflammatory protein measurements taken less than 6 weeks after injury.

Development of a Novel (18)F-Labeled Probe for PET Imaging of Estrogen Receptor 
β.

Estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) is an important ER subtype that plays crucial roles 
in many physiological and pathological disorders. Herein, we developed the probe 
[18F]PVBO for in vivo ERβ targeted PET imaging and obtained promising results. 
The nonradioactive PVBO showed a 12.5-fold stronger binding affinity to ERβ than 
to ERα in vitro. In vitro assays revealed the specific uptake of [18F]PVBO by 
DU145 cells. The uptake of [18F]PVBO by DU145 xenografts increased during the 
120 min dynamic scanning, with a maximum uptake of 2.80 ± 0.30% ID/g. Based on 
time activity curves (TACs), the injection of [18F]PVBO with unlabeled PVBO or 
ERB-041 resulted in a significant signal reduction with the tumor/muscle (T/M) 
ratio <1 at 30, 60, 75, and 120 min post-injection (p < 0.05). [18F]PVBO 
demonstrates the feasibility of noninvasively imaging ERβ-positive tumors by 
small-animal PET and provides a new strategy for visualizing ERβ in vivo.

Sensitive and Specific Detection of Estrogens Featuring Doped Silicon Nanowire 
Arrays.

Duan W(1)(2), Zhi H(3)(4), Keefe DW(1)(2), Gao B(1)(2), LeFevre GH(3)(4), Toor 
F(1)(2).

Estrogens and estrogen-mimicking compounds in the aquatic environment are known 
to cause negative impacts to both ecosystems and human health. In this initial 
proof-of-principle study, we developed a novel vertically oriented silicon 
nanowire (vSiNW) array-based biosensor for low-cost, highly sensitive and 
selective detection of estrogens. The vSiNW arrays were formed using an 
inexpensive and scalable metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) process. A vSiNW 
array-based p-n junction diode (vSiNW-diode) transducer design for the biosensor 
was used and functionalized via 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES)-based 
silane chemistry to bond estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-α) to the surface of the 
vSiNWs. Following receptor conjugation, the biosensors were exposed to 
increasing concentrations of estradiol (E2), resulting in a well-calibrated 
sensor response (R 2 ≥ 0.84, 1-100 ng/mL concentration range). Fluorescence 
measurements quantified the distribution of estrogen receptors across the vSiNW 
array compared to planar Si, indicating an average of 7 times higher receptor 
presence on the vSiNW array surface. We tested the biosensor's target 
selectivity by comparing it to another estrogen (estrone [E1]) and an androgen 
(testosterone), where we measured a high positive electrical biosensor response 
after E1 exposure and a minimal response after testosterone. The regeneration 
capacity of the biosensor was tested following three successive rinses with 
phosphate buffer solution (PBS) between hormone exposure. Traditional 
horizontally oriented Si NW field effect transistor (hSiNW-FET)-based biosensors 
report electrical current changes at the nanoampere (nA) level that require 
bulky and expensive measurement equipment making them unsuitable for field 
measurements, whereas the reported vSiNW-diode biosensor exhibits current 
changes in the microampere (μA) range, demonstrating up to 100-fold electrical 
signal amplification, thus enabling sensor signal measurement using inexpensive 
electronics. The highly sensitive and specific vSiNW-diode biosensor developed 
here will enable the creation of low-cost, portable, field-deployable biosensors 
that can detect estrogenic compounds in waterways in real-time.

Assessment of Risk of Rheumatoid Arthritis Among Underground Hard Rock and Other 
Mining Industry Workers in Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah.

Blanc PD(1)(2), Trupin L(1), Yelin EH(1), Schmajuk G(1)(2).

IMPORTANCE: Respirable silica exposure has been strongly and consistently linked 
to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) among foundry workers, persons in the construction 
trades, stone crushers and drillers, and coal miners. However, risk of RA in 
hard rock mining has not been thoroughly investigated.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze occupational risk of RA in hard rock miners in Colorado, 
New Mexico, and Utah.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional survey study estimated 
the association between mining industry work and reported RA in a random-digit 
telephone survey of men 50 years or older living in selected counties with 
elevated levels of pneumoconiosis mortality (N = 1988). The survey was conducted 
between January 12 and May 4, 2021.
EXPOSURES: Underground hard rock and other mining and related mineral-processing 
occupations.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Report of a clinician diagnosis of RA further 
defined by treatment with corticosteroids or disease-modifying antirheumatic 
drugs. Risk was estimated using logistic regression.
RESULTS: The analytic sample of 1988 men (survey response rate, 11.1% of all 
contacts) had a mean (SD) age of 68.6 (10.1) years. Underground hard rock mining 
was reported by 118 (5.9%); underground mining of other types, predominantly 
coal mining (no concomitant hard rock), 62 (3.1%); and surface mining or ore 
processing (no underground), 262 (13.2%). Adjusting for age and smoking and 
accounting for nonmining silica exposure, mining employment was associated with 
increased odds of corticosteroid-treated RA (n = 89) (odds ratio, 4.12 [95%, 
2.49-6.81]). The odds were similar for RA treated with disease-modifying 
antirheumatic drugs (n = 80) (odds ratio, 3.30 [95% CI, 1.93-5.66]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional survey study, workers in hard 
rock and other underground mining and surface mining occupations experienced 3- 
to 4-fold increased odds of RA. These findings suggest that clinicians should 
consider patients with relevant work exposures as at higher risk for developing 
RA.

CD44 receptor targeted nanoparticles augment immunity against tuberculosis in 
mice.

Haviland D(4), Jagannath C(5), Godin B(6), Khan A(7).

We describe a role of CD44-mediated signaling during host-defense against 
tuberculosis (TB) using a mouse model of TB and studies in M. tuberculosis (Mtb) 
infected human macrophage (MФ). Liposomes targeting CD44 using thioaptamers 
(CD44TA-LIP) were designed and tested as new vaccines to boost host immunity in 
TB. CD44TA-LIP enhanced killing of Mtb in human MФ, which correlated with an 
increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-12. 
CD44TA-LIP activated MФ showed an enhanced MHC-II dependent antigen presentation 
to CD4 T-cells. Inhibition of cellular proliferation and cytoskeleton 
rearrangement pathways downstream of CD44 signaling abrogated CD44TA-LIP-induced 
antimicrobial effects. Blockade of inflammatory pathways also reduced antigen 
presentation by MФ and activation of CD4 T cells. Mtb infected MФ treated with 
CD44TA-LIP exhibited increased nitric oxide and HβD2 defensin peptide 
production. Among Mtb infected mice with increased lung and spleen loads of 
organisms, intranasal administration of CD44TA-LIP led to a ten-fold reduction 
of colony forming units of Mtb and elevated IFN-γ + CD4, effector, central and 
resident memory T cells. Biodistribution studies demonstrated that CD44TA-LIP 
preferentially accumulated in the lungs and were associated with CD11b + cells. 
CD44TA-LIP treated mice showed no weight loss or increased liver LDH levels. 
This study highlights the importance of CD44-mediated signaling in host-defense 
during TB and the therapeutic potential of CD44TA-LIP.

Urinary Proteome Differences in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Pre and Post 
Liraglutide Treatment.

Rafiullah M(1), Benabdelkamel H(2), Masood A(2), Ekhzaimy AA(3), Musambil M(2), 
Joy SS(1), Alfadda AA(1)(2)(3).

Diabetes mellitus is a chronic multisystem disease with a high global 
prevalence. The glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist liraglutide is 
known to lower glucose levels and reduce weight. However, the mechanisms 
underlying the benefits of liraglutide treatment in patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remain unclear. Twelve male patients with T2DM (pre and 
post liraglutide treatment) and HbA1c between 8% and 11% were recruited. In the 
present study, a two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) 
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI TOF) mass 
spectrometric approach combined with bioinformatics and network pathway analysis 
was used to explore the urine proteomic profile. The mean age of the patients 
was 52.4 ± 7.5 years. After treatment with liraglutide, a statistically 
significant change (p < 0.006) was observed in HbA1c with no significant changes 
in body weight or markers of dyslipidemia. Two-dimensional difference gel 
electrophoresis identified significant changes (≥1.5-fold change, ANOVA, p ≤ 
0.05) in 32 proteins (4 down- and 28 upregulated) in liraglutide post treatment 
compared to the pre-treatment state. Albumin, serotransferrin, metallothionein-2 
(MT-2), and keratins K1 and K10 were found to be upregulated after liraglutide 
treatment. The patients showed significant improvement in glycemic control after 
the 12-week treatment with liraglutide. The renoprotective effect of liraglutide 
may be linked to the increased urinary abundance of MT-2 and the decreased 
abundance of zinc alpha 2-glycoprotein (ZAG) and Alpha-1 antitrypsin (α1-AT). 
More studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind the 
renoprotective effects of liraglutide.

Age estimation based on epigenetic markers is a DNA intelligence tool with the 
potential to provide relevant information for criminal investigations, as well 
as to improve the inference of age-dependent physical characteristics such as 
male pattern baldness or hair color. Age prediction models have been developed 
based on different tissues, including saliva and buccal cells, which show 
different methylation patterns as they are composed of different cell 
populations. On many occasions in a criminal investigation, the origin of a 
sample or the proportion of tissues is not known with certainty, for example the 
provenance of cigarette butts, so use of combined models can provide lower 
prediction errors. In the present study, two tissue-specific and seven 
age-correlated CpG sites were selected from publicly available data from the 
Illumina HumanMethylation 450 BeadChip and bibliographic searches, to help build 
a tissue-dependent, and an age-prediction model, respectively. For the 
development of both models, a total of 184 samples (N = 91 saliva and N = 93 
buccal cells) ranging from 21 to 86 years old were used. Validation of the 
models was performed using either k-fold cross-validation and an additional set 
of 184 samples (N = 93 saliva and N = 91 buccal cells, 21-86 years old). The 
tissue prediction model was developed using two CpG sites (HUNK and RUNX1) based 
on logistic regression that produced a correct classification rate for saliva 
and buccal swab samples of 88.59 % for the training set, and 83.69 % for the 
testing set. Despite these high success rates, a combined age prediction model 
was developed covering both saliva and buccal cells, using seven CpG sites 
(cg10501210, LHFPL4, ELOVL2, PDE4C, HOXC4, OTUD7A and EDARADD) based on 
multivariate quantile regression giving a median absolute error (MAE): ± 3.54 
years and a correct classification rate ( %CP±PI) of 76.08 % for the training 
set, and an MAE of ± 3.66 years and a %CP±PI of 71.19 % for the testing set. The 
addition of tissue-of origin as a co-variate to the model was assessed, but no 
improvement was detected in age predictions. Finally, considering the 
limitations usually faced by forensic DNA analyses, the robustness of the model 
and the minimum recommended amount of input DNA for bisulfite conversion were 
evaluated, considering up to 10 ng of genomic DNA for reproducible results. The 
final multivariate quantile regression age predictor based on the models we 
developed has been placed in the open-access Snipper forensic classification 
website.

Molecular mechanism of the severe MH/CCD mutation Y522S in skeletal ryanodine 
receptor (RyR1) by cryo-EM.

Iyer KA(1), Hu Y(1), Klose T(2), Murayama T(3), Samsó M(1).

Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are main regulators of intracellular Ca2+ release and 
muscle contraction. The Y522S mutation of RyR1 causes central core disease, a 
weakening myopathy, and malignant hyperthermia, a sudden and potentially fatal 
response to anesthetics or heat. Y522 is in the core of the N-terminal subdomain 
C of RyR1 and the mechanism of how this mutation orchestrates malfunction is 
unpredictable for this 2-MDa ion channel, which has four identical subunits 
composed of 15 distinct cytoplasmic domains each. We expressed and purified the 
RyR1 rabbit homolog, Y523S, from HEK293 cells and reconstituted it in nanodiscs 
under closed and open states. The high-resolution cryogenic electron microscopic 
(cryo-EM) three-dimensional (3D) structures show that the phenyl ring of Tyr 
functions in a manner analogous to a "spacer" within an α-helical bundle. 
Mutation to the much smaller Ser alters the hydrophobic network within the 
bundle, triggering rearrangement of its α-helices with repercussions in the 
orientation of most cytoplasmic domains. Examining the mutation-induced 
readjustments exposed a series of connected α-helices acting as an ∼100 Å-long 
lever: One end protrudes toward the dihydropyridine receptor, its molecular 
activator (akin to an antenna), while the other end reaches the Ca2+ activation 
site. The Y523S mutation elicits channel preactivation in the absence of any 
activator and full opening at 1.5 µM free Ca2+, increasing by ∼20-fold the 
potency of Ca2+ to activate the channel compared with RyR1 wild type (WT). This 
study identified a preactivated pathological state of RyR1 and a long-range 
lever that may work as a molecular switch to open the channel.

The predictive value of maternal serum AFP to PAPP-A or b-hCG ratios in 
spontaneous preterm birth.

Celik E(1), Melekoğlu R(2), Baygül A(3), Kalkan U(1), Şimşek Y(4).

The use of the second trimester alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) along with the first 
trimester pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) has been found to be 
useful in the estimation of unfavourable pregnancy outcome. Our aim in this 
study was to determine the relationship between maternal PAPP-A and b-hCG and 
AFP concentrations in spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB). This prospective cohort 
study included 372 singleton pregnancies with PAPP-A, b-hCG and AFP levels in 
the first trimester, which were converted to multiples of the median (MoM). The 
predictive ability of AFP-to-PAPP-A and AFP-to-b-hCG ratios for sPTB was 
evaluated. The risk for sPTB ≤34 weeks increased in women with AFP-to-PAPP-A 
ratio >7 (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.2-6.4). Women with AFP-to-b-hCG ratio >0.6 had a 
3.5-fold higher risk for sPTB ≤32 weeks. Increased maternal AFP-to-PAPP-A or 
AFP-to-b-hCG ratios in the first trimester may help to predict pregnant women at 
high risk for sPTB, and this may be beneficial in developing management 
plans.Impact StatementWhat is already known on this subject? There is a 
synergistic association between the combination of low pregnancy-associated 
plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) in the first trimester with alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in 
the second trimester with subsequent development of PTB. Maternal serum 
biochemical markers measured as a part of aneuploidy screening are reflective of 
pregnancy adverse outcomes related with placental insufficiency. PAPP-A and AFP 
have a low predictive ability to determine women at high risk for preterm 
birth.What do the results of this study add? Elevated AFP:PAPP-A or AFP:B-HCG 
ratio in the first trimester is associated with increased risk for sPTB. The 
ratios of these biochemical markers in the first trimester may be beneficial to 
identify women at high risk for sPTB.What are the implications of these findings 
for clinical practice and/or further research? The ratios may predict pregnant 
women at high risk for sPTB, and such risk may be helpful in the development of 
a management plan. Incorporation of AFP:PAPP-A or AFP:B-HCG ratios in the first 
trimester may help to improve the screening efficacies, and provide a simple 
alternative tool.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the major causes of cancer-related 
death worldwide. Although commercial biomarkers of CRC are currently available, 
they are still lacking in terms of sensitivity and specificity; thus, searching 
for reliable blood-based biomarkers are important for the primary screening of 
CRC.
METHODS: Plasma samples of patients with non-metastatic (NM) and metastatic (M) 
CRC and healthy controls were fractionated using MARS-14 immunoaffinity 
chromatography. The flow-through and elute fractions representing low- and 
high-abundant proteins, respectively, were analyzed by label-free quantitative 
proteomics mass spectrometry. The functional analysis of the proteins with 
greater than 1.5-fold differential expression level between the CRC and the 
healthy control groups were analyzed for their biological processes and 
molecular functions. In addition, the levels of plasma proteins showing large 
alterations in CRC patients were confirmed by immunoblotting using two 
independent cohorts. Moreover, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 
analysis was performed for individual and combinations of biomarker candidates 
so as to evaluate the diagnostic performance of biomarker candidates.
RESULTS: From 163 refined identifications, five proteins were up-regulated and 
two proteins were down-regulated in NM-CRC while eight proteins were 
up-regulated and three proteins were down-regulated in M-CRC, respectively. 
Altered plasma proteins in NM-CRC were mainly involved in complement activation, 
while those in M-CRC were clustered in acute-phase response, complement 
activation, and inflammatory response. Results from the study- and 
validation-cohorts indicate that the levels of leucine-rich 
alpha-2-glycoprotein-1(LRG), complement component C9 (C9), alpha-1-acid 
glycoprotein 1 (AGP1), and alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) were statistically 
increased, while fibronectin (FN) level was statistically decreased in CRC 
patients compared to healthy controls, with most alterations found in a 
metastatic stage-dependent manner. ROC analysis revealed that FN exhibited the 
best diagnostic performance to discriminate CRC patients and healthy controls 
while AGP1 showed the best discrimination between the disease stages in both 
cohorts. The combined biomarker candidates, FN + A1AT + AGP1, exhibited perfect 
discriminatory power to discriminate between the CRC population and healthy 
controls whereas LRG + A1AT + AGP1 was likely to be the best panel to 
discriminate the metastatic stages in both cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified and quantified distinct plasma proteome 
profiles of CRC patients. Selected CRC biomarker candidates including FN, LRG, 
C9, A1AT, and AGP1 may be further applied for screening larger cohorts including 
disease groups from other types of cancer or other diseases.

The Th1/Tfh-like biased responses elicited by the rASP-1 innate adjuvant are 
dependent on TRIF and Type I IFN receptor pathways.

Ov-ASP-1 (rASP-1), a parasite-derived protein secreted by the helminth 
Onchocerca volvulus, is an adjuvant which enhances the potency of the influenza 
trivalent vaccine (IIV3), even when used with 40-fold less IIV3. This study is 
aimed to provide a deeper insight into the molecular networks that underline the 
adjuvanticity of rASP-1. Here we show that rASP-1 stimulates mouse CD11c+ bone 
marrow-derived dendritic (BMDCs) to secrete elevated levels of IL-12p40, TNF-α, 
IP-10 and IFN-β in a TRIF-dependent but MyD88-independent manner. 
rASP-1-activated BMDCs promoted the differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into 
Th1 cells (IFN-γ+) that was TRIF- and type I interferon receptor 
(IFNAR)-dependent, and into Tfh-like cells (IL21+) and Tfh1 (IFN-γ+ IL21+) that 
were TRIF-, MyD88- and IFNAR-dependent. rASP-1-activated BMDCs promoted the 
differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into Th17 (IL-17+) cells only when the 
MyD88 pathway was inhibited. Importantly, rASP-1-activated human blood cDCs 
expressed upregulated genes that are associated with DC maturation, type I IFN 
and type II IFN signaling, as well as TLR4-TRIF dependent signaling. These 
activated cDCs promoted the differentiation of naïve human CD4+ T cells into 
Th1, Tfh-like and Th17 cells. Our data thus confirms that the rASP-1 is a potent 
innate adjuvant that polarizes the adaptive T cell responses to Th1/Tfh1 in both 
mouse and human DCs. Notably, the rASP-1-adjuvanted IIV3 vaccine elicited 
protection of mice from a lethal H1N1 infection that is also dependent on the 
TLR4-TRIF axis and IFNAR signaling pathway, as well as on its ability to induce 
anti-IIV3 antibody production.

Use of wastewater surveillance for early detection of Alpha and Epsilon 
SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and estimation of overall COVID-19 infection 
burden.

EC(8).

A decline in diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 is expected to delay the tracking 
of COVID-19 variants of concern and interest in the United States. We 
hypothesize that wastewater surveillance programs provide an effective 
alternative for detecting emerging variants and assessing COVID-19 incidence, 
particularly when clinical surveillance is limited. Here, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2 
RNA in wastewater from eight locations across Southern Nevada between March 2020 
and April 2021. Trends in SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations (ranging from 4.3 log10 
gc/L to 8.7 log10 gc/L) matched trends in confirmed COVID-19 incidence, but 
wastewater surveillance also highlighted several limitations with the clinical 
data. Amplicon-based whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 86 wastewater samples 
identified the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and B.1.429 (Epsilon) lineages in December 2020, 
but clinical sequencing failed to identify the variants until January 2021, 
thereby demonstrating that 'pooled' wastewater samples can sometimes expedite 
variant detection. Also, by calibrating fecal shedding (11.4 log10 gc/infection) 
and wastewater surveillance data to reported seroprevalence, we estimate that 
~38% of individuals in Southern Nevada had been infected by SARS-CoV-2 as of 
April 2021, which is significantly higher than the 10% of individuals confirmed 
through clinical testing. Sewershed-specific ascertainment ratios (i.e., X-fold 
infection undercounts) ranged from 1.0 to 7.7, potentially due to demographic 
differences. Our data underscore the growing application of wastewater 
surveillance in not only the identification and quantification of infectious 
agents, but also the detection of variants of concern that may be missed when 
diagnostic testing is limited or unavailable.

Oral contraceptive pill (OCP) treatment alters the gene expression of 
intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), 
monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 
(PAI-1) in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) women compared to drug-naive PCOS 
women.

BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) presents clinical symptoms of 
menstrual abnormalities, excessive hair growth (hirsutism), scalp hair loss, 
acne and infertility. Metabolic abnormalities such as obesity, insulin 
resistance, glucose intolerance and cardiovascular problems constitute an 
essential part of PCOS, all of which can have significant long-term health 
consequences. Low-grade chronic inflammation demonstrated by persistent 
moderately elevated serum levels of inflammatory and coagulatory markers plays a 
critical role in the pathogenesis of PCOS. Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) 
constitute the mainstay of pharmacologic therapy for women with PCOS to 
regularize cyclicity and ameliorate androgen excess. On the other hand, OCP use 
is associated with various venous thromboembolic and proinflammatory events in 
the general population. PCOS women always carriers the increased lifetime risk 
of these events. The studies on the effect of OCPs on inflammatory, coagulation 
and metabolic parameters in PCOS are less robust. Therefore in this study, we 
investigated and compared the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression profiles of genes 
implicated in inflammatory and coagulation pathways between drug-naive and 
OCP-treated PCOS women. The selected genes include intercellular adhesion 
molecule-1 (ICAM-1), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), monocyte chemoattractant 
protein-1 (MCP-1) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). Furthermore, 
the correlation between the selected markers and various metabolic indices in 
the OCP group has also been explored.
METHOD: The relative amounts of ICAM-1, TNF-α, MCP-1 and PAI-1 mRNA in 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 25 drug-naive PCOS subjects (controls) 
and 25 PCOS subjects who received OCPs containing 0.03 mg-ethinyl-estradiol and 
0.15 mg-levonorgestrel for at least six months (cases) were estimated using 
real-time qPCR. The statistical interpretation was conducted using SPSS version 
20.0 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL), Epi Info version 2002 (Disease Control and 
Prevention Centres, Atlanta, GA) and GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, La 
Jolla, CA) software.
RESULT: Six months of OCP therapy enhanced the expression of inflammatory genes 
viz ICAM-1, TNF-α and MCP-1 mRNA in PCOS women by 2.54, 2.05 and 1.74 folds, 
respectively, in this study. However, PAI-1 mRNA in the OCP group showed no 
significant increase. Furthermore, in cases, ICAM-1 mRNA expression positively 
correlated with body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.01), fasting insulin (p = 0.01), 
insulin 2 h p = 0.02), glucose 2 h (p = 0.01) and triglycerides (p = 0.01). 
TNF-α mRNA expression positively correlated with fasting insulin (p = 0.0007). 
MCP-1 mRNA expression positively correlated with (BMI) (p = 0.002).
CONCLUSION: OCPs helped reduce clinical hyperandrogenism and regularise 
menstrual cycles in women with PCOS. However, OCP use was associated with 
increased fold expression of inflammatory markers which positively correlated 
with metabolic abnormalities.

and Molecular Subtyping of Gliomas.

X(2)(3), Cheng H(5), Zhang Y(6), Aili A(7), Yao Z(1), Zhang XY(2)(3), Ren Y(1).

This study aimed to explore the value of deep learning (DL)-assisted 
quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) in glioma grading and molecular 
subtyping. Forty-two patients with gliomas, who underwent preoperative T2 
fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2 FLAIR), contrast-enhanced T1-weighted 
imaging (T1WI + C), and QSM scanning at 3.0T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
were included in this study. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry staining 
were used to determine glioma grades, and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and 
alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked gene (ATRX) subtypes. 
Tumor segmentation was performed manually using Insight Toolkit-SNAP program 
(www.itksnap.org). An inception convolutional neural network (CNN) with a 
subsequent linear layer was employed as the training encoder to capture 
multi-scale features from MRI slices. Fivefold cross-validation was utilized as 
the training strategy (seven samples for each fold), and the ratio of sample 
size of the training, validation, and test dataset was 4:1:1. The performance 
was evaluated by the accuracy and area under the curve (AUC). With the inception 
CNN, single modal of QSM showed better performance in differentiating 
glioblastomas (GBM) and other grade gliomas (OGG, grade II-III), and predicting 
IDH1 mutation and ATRX loss (accuracy: 0.80, 0.77, 0.60) than either T2 FLAIR 
(0.69, 0.57, 0.54) or T1WI + C (0.74, 0.57, 0.46). When combining three 
modalities, compared with any single modality, the best AUC/accuracy/F1-scores 
were reached in grading gliomas (OGG and GBM: 0.91/0.89/0.87, low-grade and 
high-grade gliomas: 0.83/0.86/0.81), predicting IDH1 mutation (0.88/0.89/0.85), 
and predicting ATRX loss (0.78/0.71/0.67). As a supplement to conventional MRI, 
DL-assisted QSM is a promising molecular imaging method to evaluate glioma 
grades, IDH1 mutation, and ATRX loss.

Targeted delivery of harmine to xenografted human pancreatic islets promotes 
robust cell proliferation.

Mishra S(1)(2), Streeter PR(3).

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) occurs as a consequence of the autoimmune destruction of 
insulin-producing pancreatic beta (β) cells and commonly presents with insulin 
deficiency and unregulated glycemic control. Despite improvements in the medical 
management of T1D, life-threatening complications are still common. Beta-cell 
replication to replace lost cells may be achieved by using small-molecule 
mitogenic drugs, like harmine. However, the safe and effective delivery of such 
drugs to beta cells remains a challenge. This work aims to deploy an antibody 
conjugated nanocarrier platform to achieve cell-specific delivery of candidate 
therapeutic and imaging agents to pancreatic endocrine cells. We approached this 
goal by generating core-shell type micellar nanocarriers composed of the 
tri-block copolymer, Pluronic®F127 (PEO100-PPO65-PEO100). We decorated these 
nanocarriers with a pancreatic endocrine cell-selective monoclonal antibody 
(HPi1), with preference for beta cells, to achieve active targeting. The 
PPO-based hydrophobic core allows encapsulation of various hydrophobic cargoes, 
whereas the PEO-based hydrophilic shell curbs the protein adhesion, hence 
prolonging the nanocarriers' systemic circulation time. The nancarriers were 
loaded with quantum dots (QDots) that allowed nanocarrier detection both 
in-vitro and in-vivo. In-vitro studies revealed that HPi1 conjugated 
nanocarriers could target endocrine cells in dispersed islet cell preparations 
with a high degree of specificity, with beta cells exhibiting a fluorescent 
quantum dot signal that was approximately five orders of magnitude greater than 
the signal associated with alpha cells. In vivo endocrine cell targeting studies 
demonstrated that the HPi1 conjugated nanocarriers could significantly 
accumulate at the islet xenograft site. For drug delivery studies, the 
nanocarriers were loaded with harmine. We demonstrated that HPi1 conjugated 
nanocarriers successfully targeted and delivered harmine to human endocrine 
cells in a human islet xenograft model. In this model, targeted harmine delivery 
yielded an ~ 41-fold increase in the number of BrdU positive cells in the human 
islet xenograft than that observed in untreated control mice. By contrast, 
non-targeted harmine yielded an ~ 9-fold increase in BrdU positive cells. We 
conclude that the nanocarrier platform enabled cell-selective targeting of 
xenografted human pancreatic endocrine cells and the selective delivery of the 
hydrophobic drug harmine to those cells. Further, the dramatic increase in 
proliferation with targeted harmine, a likely consequence of achieving higher 
local drug concentrations, supports the concept that targeted drug delivery may 
promote more potent biological responses when using harmine and/or other drugs 
than non-targeting approaches. These results suggest that this targeted drug 
delivery platform may apply in drug screening, beta cell regenerative therapies, 
and/or diagnostic imaging in patients with type 1 diabetes.

Impact of collaborative actions of Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis 
subpopulations on the infection profile.

Cascabulho CM(3), Henriques-Pons A(3), Pereira MCS(4), Alves CR(1), Dias-Lopes 
G(1).

This study focuses on the role of the population structure of Leishmania spp. on 
the adaptive capacity of the parasite. Herein, we investigate the contribution 
of subpopulations of the L. (V.) braziliensis Thor strain (Thor03, Thor10 and 
Thor22) in the profile of murine macrophages infection. Infection assays were 
performed with binary combinations of these subpopulations at stationary phases. 
The initial interaction time showed major effects on the combination assays, as 
demonstrated by the significant increase in the infection rate at 5 h. Based on 
the endocytic index (EI), Thor10 (EI = 563.6) and Thor03 (EI = 497) showed a 
higher infection load compared to Thor22 (EI = 227.3). However, the EI decreased 
in Thor03 after 48 h (EI = 447) and 72 h (EI = 388.3) of infection, and showed 
changes in the infection level in all Thor10/Thor22 combinations. Assays with 
CellTrace CFSE-labelled Thor22 promastigotes indicated an increase (~1.5 fold) 
in infection by this subpopulation in the presence of Thor10 when compared to 
the infection profile of Thor03/Thor22 combinations in the same proportions. In 
addition, the potential of these subpopulations, alone or in binary 
combinations, to modulate the expression of cytokines and nitric oxide (NO) in 
vitro was investigated. Lower NO and tumour necrosis factor-α production levels 
were observed for all Thor10/Thor22 combinations at 24 h compared to these 
subpopulations alone. In contrast, Thor03/Thor22 combination assays increased 
IL-10 production at this time. Collectively, these results provide in vitro 
evidence on the potential of L. (V.) braziliensis population structure to play a 
relevant role in a host infection by this parasite.

2-Aminopyridines with a shortened amino sidechain as potent, selective, and 
highly permeable human neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitors.

Vasu D(1), Li H(2), Hardy CD(2), Poulos TL(3), Silverman RB(4).

A series of potent, selective, and highly permeable human neuronal nitric oxide 
synthase inhibitors (hnNOS) based on the 2-aminopyridine scaffold with a 
shortened amino sidechain is reported. A rapid and simple protocol was developed 
to access these inhibitors in excellent yields. Neuronal nitric oxide synthase 
(nNOS) is a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of various neurological 
disorders. The major challenges in designing nNOS inhibitors in humans focus on 
potency, selectivity over other isoforms of nitric oxide synthases (NOSs), and 
blood-brain barrier permeability. In this context, we discovered a promising 
inhibitor, 6-(3-(4,4-difluoropiperidin-1-yl)propyl)-4-methylpyridin-2-amine 
dihydrochloride, that exhibits excellent potency for rat (Ki = 46 nM) and human 
nNOS (Ki = 48 nM), respectively, with 388-fold human eNOS and 135-fold human 
iNOS selectivity. It also displayed excellent permeability (Pe = 17.3 × 10-6 cm 
s-1) through a parallel artificial membrane permeability assay, a model for 
blood-brain permeability. We found that increasing lipophilicity by 
incorporation of fluorine atoms on the backbone of the inhibitors significantly 
increased potential blood-brain barrier permeability. In addition to measuring 
potency, isoform selectivity, and permeability of NOS inhibitors, we also 
explored structure-activity relationships via structures of key inhibitors 
complexed to various isoforms of nitric oxide synthases.

Chronic ethanol consumption plus an atherogenic diet cause metabolic 
steatohepatitis with advanced liver fibrosis in apolipoprotein E/low-density 
lipoprotein receptor double-knockout mice.

Liu J(1), Oba Y(1), Yamano S(2).

BACKGROUND: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is the inflammatory subtype of 
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease with a high risk of progression to liver 
fibrosis. We investigated metabolic steatohepatitis with advanced liver fibrosis 
in apolipoprotein E/low-density lipoprotein receptor double-knockout (AL) mice 
fed a co-diet of ethanol with a low-carbohydrate-high-protein-high-fat 
atherogenic diet (AD) for 16 weeks. We also examined the underlying mechanisms, 
especially hepatic sympathetic activation, involved in the effects.
METHODS: We maintained 12-week-old male AL mice on AD and a standard chow diet 
(SCD) with or without ethanol treatment for 16 weeks. Age-matched male C57BL/6J 
mice on SCD without ethanol treatment served as controls. We conducted blood 
biochemical, histopathological, and fluorescence immunohistochemical, and 
reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction studies.
RESULTS: AL mice showed significant hyperlipidemia. AD induced increased body 
weight, hepatic steatosis, and hepatic damage; ethanol and the AD co-diet 
resulted in hepatic sympathetic activation accompanied by hepatic steatosis, 
lobular inflammation, bridging fibrosis, and hepatic damage. Hepatic Kupffer 
cells (KCs) and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which showed sympathetic 
activation, produced 4.4- to 9.4-fold more inflammatory factors (KC and 
KC-derived tumor necrosis factor-α, and chemokine [C-C motif] ligand 2) and 2.0- 
to 32.0-fold more fibrosis factors (HSC and HSC-derived transforming growth 
factor β1 and collagen 1a1); all p < 0.05 vs. controls.
CONCLUSIONS: We created a model of metabolic steatohepatitis with advanced liver 
fibrosis from coexisting hyperlipidemia and hepatic sympathetic activation in AL 
mice on a co-diet of ethanol and AD. KCs and HSCs became the cellular targets of 
hepatic sympathetic activation, which could play a role in the initiation and 
progression of metabolic steatohepatitis with advanced liver fibrosis.

Intranasal Administration of Dolutegravir-Loaded Nanoemulsion-Based In Situ Gel 
for Enhanced Bioavailability and Direct Brain Targeting.

Dolutegravir's therapeutic effectiveness in the management of neuroAIDS is 
mainly limited by its failure to cross the blood-brain barrier. However, 
lipid-based nanovesicles such as nanoemulsions have demonstrated their potential 
for the brain targeting of various drugs by intranasal delivery. Thus, the 
purpose of this study was to develop a Dolutegravir-loaded nanoemulsion-based in 
situ gel and evaluate its prospective for brain targeting by intranasal 
delivery. Dolutegravir-loaded nanoemulsions were prepared using dill oil, Tween® 
80, and Transcutol® P. Optimization of the nanoemulsion particle size and drug 
release was carried out using a simplex lattice design. Formulations (F1-F7 and 
B1-B6) were assessed for various pharmaceutical characteristics. Ex vivo 
permeation and ciliotoxicity studies of selected in situ gels (B1) were 
conducted using sheep nasal mucosa. Drug targeting to the brain was assessed in 
vivo in rats following the nasal delivery of B1. The composition of oil, 
surfactant, and cosurfactant significantly (p < 0.05) influenced the dependent 
variables (particle size and % of drug release in 8 h). Formulation B1 exhibits 
pharmaceutical characteristics that are ideal for intranasal delivery. The 
mucosal steady-state flux noticed with BI was significantly greater (p < 0.005) 
than for the control gel. A histopathology of nasal mucosa treated with BI 
showed no signs of toxicity or cellular damage. Intranasal administration of B1 
resulted in greater Cmax (~six-fold, p < 0.0001) and AUC0-α (~five-fold, p < 
0.0001), and decreased Tmax (1 h) values in the brain, compared to intravenous 
administration. Meantime, the drug level in the plasma was relatively low, 
suggesting less systemic exposure to Dolutegravir through intranasal delivery. 
In summary, the promising data observed here signifies the prospective of B1 to 
enhance the brain targeting of Dolutegravir by intranasal delivery and it could 
be used as a feasible and practicable strategy for the management of neuroAIDS.

Bacillus amyloliquifaciens-Supplemented Camel Milk Suppresses Neuroinflammation 
of Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis in a Mouse Model by Regulating Inflammatory 
Markers.

Ibrahim HIM(1)(2), Sheikh A(3), Khalil HE(4)(5), Khalifa A(1)(6).

Multiple sclerosis (MS), a distinct autoimmune neuroinflammatory disorder, 
affects millions of people worldwide, including Saudi Arabia. Changes in the gut 
microbiome are linked to the development of neuroinflammation via mechanisms 
that are not fully understood. Prebiotics and probiotics in camel milk that has 
been fermented have a variety of health benefits. In this study, Bacillus 
amyloliquefaciens-supplemented camel milk (BASY) was used to assess its 
preventive effect on MS symptoms in a myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 
(MOG)-immunized C57BL6J mice model. To this end, MOG-induced experimental 
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was established and the level of disease 
index, pathological scores, and anti-inflammatory markers of BASY-treated mice 
using macroscopic and microscopic examinations, qPCR and immunoblot were 
investigated. The results demonstrate that BASY significantly reduced the EAE 
disease index, increased total microbial load (2.5 fold), and improved the 
levels of the short-chain fatty acids propionic, butyric and caproic acids in 
the diseased mice group. Additionally, myeloperoxidase (MPO) proinflammatory 
cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17, TNF-α) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (TGF-β) 
were regulated by BASY treatment. Significant suppression of MPO and VCAM levels 
were noticed in the BASY-treated group (from 168 to 111 µM and from 34 to 27 
pg/mL, respectively), in comparison to the EAE group. BASY treatment 
significantly reduced the expression of inflammatory cytokines, inflammatory 
progression related transcripts, and inflammatory progression protein markers. 
In conclusion, BASY significantly reduced the symptoms of EAE mice and may be 
used to develop a probiotic-based diet to promote host gut health. The 
cumulative findings of this study confirm the significant neuroprotection of 
BASY in the MOG-induced mice model. They could also suggest a novel approach to 
the treatment of MS-associated disorders.

Effects of high temperature stress on the intestinal histology and microbiota in 
Yesso scallop Patinopecten yessoensis.

Kong N(1), Zhao J(1), Zhao B(1), Liu J(1), Li F(1), Wang L(2), Song L(3).

High temperature stress posed by global warming is considered as one of the 
greatest threats to marine ectotherms by altering their behavior and 
physiological functions. The intestine and its associated microbiota constitute 
the first defensive line for the animals against environmental stresses, but 
their responses to high temperature stress in mollusks are largely unknown. In 
the present study, the changes of intestinal histology and microbiota were 
investigated in Yesso scallop Patinopecten yessoensis, a cold-water bivalve 
species, after high temperature stress. The shrinkage of intestinal lumen, 
shortening of intestinal villi and increased goblet cells were observed in the 
intestines of scallops exposed to seawater temperatures of 20 °C (T20 group) and 
23 °C (T23 group), compared to the control group (15 °C). High-throughput 
sequencing of 16S rRNA gene showed that the composition of intestinal microbiota 
rather than the alpha diversity indices changed significantly after high 
temperature stress. At the phylum level, the relative abundances of 
Proteobacteria and Firmicutes decreased progressively with increasing 
temperature, while that of Bacteroidetes increased by 1.18-fold in the T20 group 
and 0.95-fold in the T23 group. At the genus level, Tenacibaculum and Mycoplasma 
were significantly enriched after high temperature stress, and Mycoplasma 
exhibited highest abundance of 39.43% in the T23 group. Functional prediction 
revealed that the pathways related to amino acid biosynthesis were blocked after 
high temperature stress, while that of phospholipases showed the opposite trend. 
According to the results of network analysis, the network connectivity decreased 
with increasing temperature, while the percentages of negative correlations in 
the two high temperature groups were higher than that in the control group. 
Collectively, the intestinal histology and microbial community of P. yessoensis 
changed significantly after high temperature stress, which would hinder the 
nutrient absorption and promote the proliferation of pathogenic microorganisms 
in the intestine of scallops. Our results will provide novel insights into the 
occurrence mechanism of mass summer mortality in marine mollusks.

Lipid-Encapsuled Grape Tannins Prevent Oxidative-Stress-Induced Neuronal Cell 
Death, Intracellular ROS Accumulation and Inflammation.

RD(1)(5)(6).

The central nervous system (CNS) is particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress 
and inflammation, which affect neuronal function and survival. Nowadays, there 
is great interest in the development of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory 
compounds extracted from natural products, as potential strategies to reduce the 
oxidative/inflammatory environment within the CNS and then preserve neuronal 
integrity and brain function. However, an important limitation of natural 
antioxidant formulations (mainly polyphenols) is their reduced in vivo 
bioavailability. The biological compatible delivery system containing 
polyphenols may serve as a novel compound for these antioxidant formulations. 
Accordingly, in the present study, we used liposomes as carriers for grape 
tannins, and we tested their ability to prevent neuronal oxidative stress and 
inflammation. Cultured catecholaminergic neurons (CAD) were used to establish 
the potential of lipid-encapsulated grape tannins (TLS) to prevent neuronal 
oxidative stress and inflammation following an oxidative insult. TLS rescued 
cell survival after H2O2 treatment (59.4 ± 8.8% vs. 90.4 ± 5.6% H2O2 vs. TLS+ 
H2O2; p < 0.05) and reduced intracellular ROS levels by ~38% (p < 0.05), despite 
displaying negligible antioxidant activity in solution. Additionally, TLS 
treatment dramatically reduced proinflammatory cytokines’ mRNA expression after 
H2O2 treatment (TNF-α: 400.3 ± 1.7 vs. 7.9 ± 1.9-fold; IL-1β: 423.4 ± 1.3 vs. 
12.7 ± 2.6-fold; p < 0.05; H2O2 vs. TLS+ H2O2, respectively), without affecting 
pro/antioxidant biomarker expression, suggesting that liposomes efficiently 
delivered tannins inside neurons and promoted cell survival. In conclusion, we 
propose that lipid-encapsulated grape tannins could be an efficient tool to 
promote antioxidant/inflammatory cell defense.

Platelet LGALS3BP as a Mediator of Myeloid Inflammation in Systemic Lupus 
Erythematosus.

C(3), Barrett TJ(1), Izmirly P(1), Belmont HM(1), Ruggles K(2), Clancy R(1), 
Buyon J(1), Berger JS(1).

OBJECTIVE: Platelets are mediators of inflammation with immune effector cell 
properties and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE). This study investigated the role of platelet-associated 
lectin, galactoside-binding, soluble 3 binding protein (LGALS3BP) as a mediator 
of inflammation in SLE and as a potential biomarker associated with clinical 
phenotypes.
METHODS: We performed RNA sequencing on platelets from patients with SLE 
(n = 54) and on platelets from age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-matched healthy 
controls (n = 18) and measured LGALS3BP levels in platelet releasate and in 
circulating serum. We investigated the association between LGALS3BP levels and 
the prevalence, disease severity, and clinical phenotypes of SLE and studied 
platelet-mediated effects on myeloid inflammation.
RESULTS: Platelets from patients with SLE exhibited increased expression of 
LGALS3BP (fold change 4.0, adjusted P = 6.02 × 10-11 ). Platelet-released 
LGALS3BP levels were highly correlated with circulating LGALS3BP (R = 0.69, 
P < 0.0001), and circulating LGALS3BP levels were correlated with the severity 
of disease according to the SLE Disease Activity Index (r = 0.32, P = 0.0006). 
Specifically, circulating LGALS3BP levels were higher in SLE patients with lupus 
nephritis than in patients with inactive disease (4.0 μg/ml versus 2.3 μg/ml; 
P < 0.001). Interferon-α induced LGALS3BP transcription and translation in a 
megakaryoblastic cell line (MEG-01) in a dose-dependent manner. Recombinant 
LGALS3BP and platelet releasates from SLE patients enhanced proinflammatory 
cytokine production by macrophages.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support that platelets act as potent effector cells 
that contribute to the pathogenesis of SLE by secreting proinflammatory 
LGALS3BP, which also represents a novel biomarker of SLE clinical activity.

Cannabinoid enhancement of lncRNA MMP25-AS1/MMP25 interaction reduces neutrophil 
infiltration and intestinal epithelial injury in HIV/SIV infection.

Premadasa LS(1), Lee E(1), McDew-White M(1), Alvarez X(1), Jayakumar S(1), Ling 
B(1), Okeoma CM(2), Byrareddy SN(3), Kulkarni S(1), Mohan M(1).

Intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction, a hallmark of HIV/SIV infection, 
persists despite viral suppression by combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). 
Emerging evidence suggests a critical role for long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in 
maintaining epithelial homeostasis. We simultaneously profiled lncRNA/mRNA 
expression exclusively in colonic epithelium (CE) of SIV-infected rhesus 
macaques (RMs) administered vehicle (VEH) or Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). 
Relative to controls, fewer lncRNAs were up- or downregulated in CE of THC/SIV 
compared with VEH/SIV RMs. Importantly, reciprocal expression of the natural 
antisense lncRNA MMP25-AS1 (up 2.3-fold) and its associated protein-coding gene 
MMP25 (attracts neutrophils by inactivating alpha-1 anti-trypsin/SERPINA1) (down 
2.2-fold) was detected in CE of THC/SIV RMs. Computational analysis verified 2 
perfectly matched complementary regions and an energetically stable (normalized 
binding free energy = -0.2626) MMP25-AS1/MMP25 duplex structure. MMP25-AS1 
overexpression blocked IFN-γ-induced MMP25 mRNA and protein expression in vitro. 
Elevated MMP25 protein expression in CE of VEH/SIV but not THC/SIV RMs was 
associated with increased infiltration by myeloperoxidase/CD11b++ neutrophils 
(transendothelial migration) and epithelial CD47 (transepithelial migration) 
expression. Interestingly, THC administered in combination with cART increased 
MMP25-AS1 and reduced MMP25 mRNA/protein expression in jejunal epithelium of 
SIV-infected RMs. Our findings demonstrate that MMP25-AS1 is a potentially 
unique epigenetic regulator of MMP25 and that low-dose THC can reduce neutrophil 
infiltration and intestinal epithelial injury potentially by downregulating 
MMP25 expression through modulation of MMP25-AS1.

One-carbon metabolism and related pathways in ruminal and small intestinal 
epithelium of lactating dairy cows.

Jiang Q(1), Sherlock DN(1), Zhang H(2), Guyader J(3), Pan YX(4)(5), Loor 
JJ(1)(5).

Physiological and environmental stresses such as the transition into lactation 
and heat load contribute to gastrointestinal tract (GIT) dysfunction. The 
nonruminant gastrointestinal tract has mechanisms to cope with pro-oxidant and 
pro-inflammatory stressors arising from the gut lumen or within intestinal 
cells. One-carbon metabolism (OCM) contributes to anti-oxidant capacity via the 
production of glutathione (GSH) and taurine, and the synthesis of phospholipid, 
creatine, and the osmolyte glycinebetaine among others. A multipronged approach 
was used to assess the biological relevance of OCM and closely-related pathways 
on GIT function in dairy cows. Ruminal papillae (Rum) and scrapings from 
duodenum (Duo), jejunum (Jej), and ileum (Ile) were collected at slaughter from 
eight multiparous Holstein cows averaging 128 ± 12 d in milk and producing 39 ± 
5 kg/d. A MIXED model ANOVA with preplanned orthogonal contrasts was used for 
statistical analysis. Methionine adenosyl transferase 1 activity (MAT) was 
~10-fold greater (P < 0.01) and cystathionine β-synthase activity doubled in Rum 
vs. small intestine. Total glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity was greatest (P 
= 0.03) in Ile, but similar to Rum. Activity and mRNA abundance of 
betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase were undetectable. There was a 2.5-fold 
greater protein abundance of GPX1 (P < 0.01) and a ~2-fold greater abundance of 
GPX3 (P < 0.01) in Rum vs. small intestine. Among the various amino acids (AA) 
with roles in OCM or closely-related pathways (e.g. creatine synthesis), 
concentrations of arginine, aspartate, glutamine, methionine, and serine were 
lower (P < 0.01) in Rum vs. small intestine. Unlike AA, concentrations of 
OCM-related intermediates S-5'-adenosyl-homocysteine (SAH), glycinebetaine, 
carnitine, creatine (CRE), and cysteinesulfinic acid were greater (P < 0.01) 
while taurine was lower in Rum vs. small intestine. Intermediates of the folate 
cycle were undetectable. The fact that S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) was 
undetectable while MAT activity and SAH were greater in Rum suggested that 
availability of SAM (a methyl donor) is a key determinant of flux through the 
folate and methionine cycles in the GIT. Except for adenosine, concentrations of 
glutamate, glycine, α-ketoglutarate, hypotaurine, and GSH were lowest in Ile. 
Together, the data underscored unique differences in activity of one-carbon 
metabolism and related pathways across sections of the GIT.

Plain Language Summary: The gastrointestinal tract serves a number of essential 
functions in the animal and exposure to physiological and environmental 
stressors can lead to disruption of its barrier function and compromise nutrient 
absorption. In nonruminants, mechanisms to cope with pro-oxidant and 
pro-inflammatory stressors are essential for maintaining gut function. 
One-carbon metabolism contributes to anti-oxidant capacity via the production of 
glutathione and taurine, synthesis of phospholipids, energy-producing compounds, 
and the osmolyte glycinebetaine among others. A multipronged approach was used 
to assess the biological relevance of one-carbon metabolism and closely-related 
pathways in the rumen and small intestine of lactating dairy cows. Enzyme 
activities, mRNA and protein abundance, and metabolite profiling revealed unique 
patterns in the rumen versus small intestine. Methyl donor synthesis, 
transsulfuration, glutathione synthesis, and glutathione peroxidase activity are 
active mechanisms in ruminal tissue. Research targeting the alteration of these 
pathways through specific nutrients during stressful periods such as the 
transition into lactation, weaning, and heat load is warranted.

C-Terminal p53 Palindromic Tetrapeptide Restores Full Apoptotic Function to 
Mutant p53 Cancer Cells In Vitro and In Vivo.

Fine RL(1), Mao Y(1), Dinnen R(1), Rosal RV(2), Raffo A(1), Hochfeld U(1), 
Senatus P(3), Bruce JN(3), Nichols G(1), Wang H(4), Li Y(2), Brandt-Rauf 
PW(2)(5).

We previously demonstrated that a synthetic monomer peptide derived from the 
C-terminus of p53 (aa 361−382) induced preferential apoptosis in mutant p53 
malignant cells, but not normal cells. The major problem with the peptide was 
its short half-life (half-life < 10 min.) due to a random coil topology found in 
3D proton NMR spectroscopy studies. To induce secondary/tertiary structures to 
produce more stability, we developed a peptide modelled after the tetrameric 
structure of p53 essential for activation of target genes. Starting with the 
above monomer peptide (aa 361−382), we added the nuclear localization sequence 
of p53 (aa 353−360) and the end of the C-terminal sequence (aa 383−393), 
resulting in a monomer spanning aa 353−393. Four monomers were linked by glycine 
to maximize flexibility and in a palindromic order that mimics p53 tetramer 
formation with four orthogonal alpha helices, which is required for p53 
transactivation of target genes. This is now known as the 4 
repeat-palindromic-p53 peptide or (4R-Pal-p53p). We explored two methods for 
testing the activity of the palindromic tetrapeptide: (1) exogenous peptide with 
a truncated antennapedia carrier (Ant) and (2) a doxycycline (Dox) inducer for 
endogenous expression. The exogenous peptide, 4R-Pal-p53p-Ant, contained a His 
tag at the N-terminal and a truncated 17aa Ant at the C-terminal. Exposure of 
human breast cancer MB-468 cells and human skin squamous cell cancer cells (both 
with mutant p53, 273 Arg->His) with purified peptide at 7 µM and 15 µM produced 
52% and 75%, cell death, respectively. Comparatively, the monomeric p53 
C-terminal peptide-Ant (aa 361−382, termed p53p-Ant), at 15 µM and 30 µM induced 
15% and 24% cell death, respectively. Compared to the p53p-Ant, the exogenous 
4R-pal-p53p-Ant was over five-fold more potent for inducing apoptosis at an 
equimolar concentration (15 µM). Endogenous 4R-Pal-p53p expression (without 
Ant), induced by Dox, resulted in 43% cell death in an engineered MB468 breast 
cancer stable cell line, while endogenous p53 C-terminal monomeric peptide 
expression produced no cell death due to rapid peptide degradation. The 
mechanism of apoptosis from 4R-Pal-p53p involved the extrinsic and intrinsic 
pathways (FAS, caspase-8, Bax, PUMA) for apoptosis, as well as increasing 
reactive oxygen species (ROS). All three death pathways were induced from 
transcriptional/translational activation of pro-apoptotic genes. Additionally, 
mRNA of p53 target genes (Bax and Fas) increased 14-fold and 18-fold, 
respectively, implying that the 4R-Pal-p53p restored full apoptotic potential to 
mutant p53. Monomeric p53p only increased Fas expression without a 
transcriptional or translational increase in Fas, and other genes and human 
marrow stem cell studies revealed no toxicity to normal stem cells for 
granulocytes, erythrocytes, monocytes, and macrophages (CFU-GEMM). Additionally, 
the peptide specifically targeted pre-malignant and malignant cells with mutant 
p53 and was not toxic to normal cells with basal levels of WT p53.

IMPORTANCE: Unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP) is a common and life-changing 
complication of cancer, trauma, and an estimated 500 000 head, neck, and chest 
surgeries performed annually in the US, among other causes (eg, idiopathic). 
Consequent disabilities are profound and often permanent and can include severe 
voice, swallowing, and breathing dysfunction and concomitant anxiety, isolation, 
and fear. Physiological measures often correlate poorly with patient-reported 
disability. The measure described herein was designed to be a comprehensive, 
psychometrically sound UVFP-specific patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) for 
use in clinical trials or at point of care.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the reliability and validity of the CoPE (vocal Cord 
Paralysis Experience) PROM in a nationally representative sample for both 
clinical and research use.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This survey validation study was performed at 
34 tertiary care centers across the US and included English-speaking adults with 
unilateral vocal fold immobility confirmed via laryngoscopy.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Reliability (internal consistency, alternate form, 
and test-retest) and validity (convergent and known-group).
RESULTS: In total, 613 patients (mean [SD] age, 58 [15.3] years; 394 [64.5%] 
women) were recruited, and 555 (92.3%) completed surveys for all time points. 
Internal consistency was high in the overall 22-item PROM and psychosocial, 
swallow, and voice subscales (Cronbach α > 0.91). Intraclass correlations for 
individuals between the baseline and 2-week administrations were moderate for 
the overall score and subscales (intraclass correlations range, 0.66-0.80). 
There were significant differences between the online and 2-week paper 
administrations for the overall score and voice and psychosocial subscales 
(overall scale mean: 54.4 [95% CI, 49.7-59.1] vs 48.9 [95% CI, 43.7-54.0] at 2 
weeks). The confirmatory model was found to be suitably fitted based on average 
r2 values 0.5 or greater for subscale and overall scores. Correlations between 
subscales and existing PROMs (Voice-Related Quality of Life, Eating Assessment 
Tool, and Communication Participation Item Bank) were all greater than 0.69, and 
mean PROM subscale scores were significantly different across known quartiles of 
existing PROMs.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this survey validation study suggest 
that the CoPE PROM could serve as a psychometrically sound, comprehensive 
measure of UVFP-attributed disability suitable for use in clinical and research 
settings to assess within-person changes. The results will inform a user manual 
to facilitate use in clinical trials comparing the effectiveness and durability 
of treatments including behavioral (speech therapy), temporary (eg, injection 
augmentation), and permanent surgical treatments for UVFP.

Objective: To explore the expression characteristics and role of Krüppel-like 
factor 4 (KLF4) in macrophage inflammatory response and its effects on 
inflammatory response and organ injury in septic mice, so as to lay a 
theoretical foundation for targeted treatment of burns and trauma sepsis. 
Methods: The method of experimental research was used. Mouse RAW264.7 
macrophages and primary peritoneal macrophages (PMs) isolated from 10 male 
C57BL/6J mice aged 6-8 weeks were used for the experiments. RAW264.7 macrophages 
and PMs were treated with endotoxin/lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 0 (without 
treatment), 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h, respectively, to establish macrophage 
inflammatory response model. The mRNA expression of interleukin 1β (IL-1β), 
IL-6, CC chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were 
detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative reverse transcription polymerase 
chain reaction (RT-PCR), and the LPS treatment time was determined for some of 
the subsequent experiments. RAW264.7 macrophages were treated with LPS for 0 and 
8 h, the localization and protein expression of KLF4 were detected by 
immunofluorescence method, transcriptome sequencing of the cells was performed 
using the high-throughput sequencing technology platform, and the differently 
expressed genes (DEGs) between the two time points treated cells were screened 
by DESeq2 software. RAW264.7 macrophages and PMs were treated with LPS for 0, 1, 
2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h, respectively, and the mRNA and protein expressions of 
KLF4 were detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR and Western 
blotting, respectively. RAW264.7 macrophages were divided into negative control 
(NC) group and KLF4-overexpression group according to the random number table, 
which were treated with LPS for 0 and 8 h respectively after transfection of 
corresponding plasmid. The mRNA expressions of KLF4, IL-1β, IL-6, CCL2, and 
TNF-α were detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR, while the 
protein expression of KLF4 was detected by Western blotting. The number of 
samples in aforementioned experiments was all 3. Forty male C57BL/6J mice aged 
6-8 weeks were divided into KLF4-overexpression group and NC group (with 20 mice 
in each group) according to the random number table, and the sepsis model of 
cecal ligation perforation was established after the corresponding transfection 
injection was injected respectively. Twelve mice were selected from each of the 
two groups according to the random number table, and the survival status within 
72 hours after modeling was observed. Eight hours after modeling, the remaining 
8 mice in each of the two groups were selected, the eyeball blood samples were 
collected to detect the levels of IL-1β and IL-6 in serum by enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay, and the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in serum by dry chemical method. Subsequently, 
the heart, lung, and liver tissue was collected, and the injury was observed 
after hematoxylin-eosin staining. Data were statistically analyzed with 
independent sample t test, Cochran & Cox approximate t test, one-way analysis of 
variance, Dunnett test, Brown-Forsythe and Welch one-way analysis of variance, 
Dunnett T3 test, log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. Results: Compared with that of LPS 
treatment for 0 h, the mRNA expressions of IL-1β in RAW264.7 macrophages treated 
with LPS for 6 h and 8 h, the mRNA expressions of IL-6 in RAW264.7 macrophages 
treated with LPS for 4-12 h, the mRNA expressions of CCL2 in RAW264.7 
macrophages treated with LPS for 8 h and 12 h, and the mRNA expressions of TNF-α 
in RAW264.7 macrophages treated with LPS for 4-8 h were significantly 
up-regulated (P<0.05 or P<0.01), while the mRNA expressions of IL-1β and CCL2 in 
PMs treated with LPS for 4-8 h, the mRNA expressions of IL-6 in PMs treated with 
LPS for 2-24 h, and the mRNA expressions of TNF-α in PMs treated with LPS for 
2-12 h were significantly up-regulated (P<0.05 or P<0.01). Eight hours was 
selected as the LPS treatment time for some of the subsequent experiments. KLF4 
mainly located in the nucleus of RAW264.7 macrophages. Compared with those of 
LPS treatment for 0 h, the protein expression of KLF4 in RAW264.7 macrophages 
treated with LPS for 8 h was obviously decreased, and there were 1 470 
statistically differentially expressed DEGs in RAW264.7 macrophages treated with 
LPS for 8 h, including KLF4 with significantly down-regulated transcriptional 
expression (false discovery rate<0.05, log2 (fold change)=-2.47). Compared with 
those of LPS treatment for 0 h, the mRNA expressions of KLF4 in RAW264.7 
macrophages treated with LPS for 6-24 h, the protein expressions of KLF4 in 
RAW264.7 macrophages and PMs treated with LPS for 1-24 h, and the mRNA 
expressions of KLF4 in PM treated with LPS for 4-24 h were significantly 
decreased (P<0.05 or P<0.01). Compared with those in NC group, the mRNA (with t' 
values of 17.03 and 8.61, respectively, P<0.05 or P<0.01) and protein 
expressions of KLF4 in RAW264.7 macrophages treated with LPS for 0 h and 8 h in 
KLF4-overexpression group were significantly increased, the mRNA expressions of 
IL-6 and CCL2 increased significantly in RAW264.7 macrophages treated with LPS 
for 0 h (with t values of 6.29 and 3.40, respectively, P<0.05 or P<0.01), while 
the mRNA expressions of IL-1β, IL-6, CCL2, and TNF-α decreased significantly in 
RAW264.7 macrophages treated with LPS for 8 h (with t values of 10.52, 9.60, 
4.58, and 8.58, respectively, P<0.01). The survival proportion of mice within 72 
h after modeling in KLF4-overexpression group was significantly higher than that 
in NC group (χ2=4.01, P<0.05). Eight hours after modeling, the serum levels of 
IL-1β, IL-6 and ALT, AST of mice in KLF4-overexpression group were (161±63), 
(476±161) pg/mL and (144±24), (264±93) U/L, respectively, which were 
significantly lower than (257±58), (654±129) pg/mL and (196±27), (407±84) U/L 
(with t values of 3.16, 2.44 and 4.04, 3.24, respectively, P<0.05 or P<0.01) in 
NC group. Eight hours after modeling, compared with those in NC group, the 
disorder of tissue structure of heart, lung, and liver, inflammatory exudation, 
and pathological changes of organ parenchyma cells in KLF4-overexpression group 
were obviously alleviated. Conclusions: The expression of KLF4 is significantly 
down-regulated in LPS-induced macrophage inflammatory response, which 
significantly inhibits the macrophage inflammatory response. KLF4 significantly 
enhances the survival rate of septic mice and alleviates inflammatory response 
and sepsis-related organ injury.

Microbial dynamics and biogenic methane production responses to the addition of 
glycine betaine in shales.

Deng S(1), Wang B(1), Sun S(2), You Q(1), She Y(2), Zhang F(3).

Biogenic methane production depends on microbial community compositions in shale 
gas reservoirs, and glycine betaine plays an important role in methanogenic 
metabolic pathways. Previous studies have mainly focused on the microbial 
community dynamics in the water produced by shale hydraulic fracturing. Here, we 
used fresh shale as a sample and obtained the methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide 
(CO2) concentrations, microbial communities, and methanogenic functional gene 
numbers of solid and liquid groups in anaerobic bottles through gas 
chromatography, 16S rDNA sequencing (60 samples) and quantitative real-time PCR 
analysis in all culture stages. With glycine betaine addition, the total CH4 
concentrations of the S1, S2 and Sw samples were 1.56, 1.05 and 4.48 times, 
while CO2 increased by 2.54-, 4.80- and 0.43-fold compared with samples without 
glycine betaine after 28 days of incubation, respectively. The alpha diversity 
was reduced when glycine betaine was added. The significant differences in 
bacterial community abundance at the genus level in samples with glycine betaine 
were Bacillus, Oceanobacillus, Acinetobacter, and Legionella. The bacterial and 
archaeal community changes implied that the addition of glycine betaine may 
promote CH4 production mainly by first forming CO2 and then generating CH4. The 
results of mrtA, mcrA, and pmoA gene numbers showed that the shale had great 
potential for producing methane. The addition of glycine betaine to shale 
changed the original microbial networks and increased the nodes and taxon 
connectedness of the Spearman association network. Our analyses indicate that 
the addition of glycine betaine enhances CH4 concentrations, causing the 
microbial network to be more complex and sustainable which supports the survival 
and adaptation of microbes in shale formations.

Functional characterization of Vibrio alginolyticus T3SS regulator ExsA and 
evaluation of its mutant as a live attenuated vaccine candidate in zebrafish 
(Danio rerio) model.

Zhang W(1)(2), Chen L(1)(2), Feng H(1)(2), Wang J(1)(2), Zeng F(1)(2), Xiao 
X(1)(2), Jian J(1)(2), Wang N(3), Pang H(1)(2).

Vibrio alginolyticus, a Gram-negative bacterium, is an opportunistic pathogen of 
both marine animals and humans, resulting in significant losses in the 
aquaculture industry. Type III secretion system (T3SS) is a crucial virulence 
mechanism of V. alginolyticus. In this study, the T3SS regulatory gene exsA, 
which was cloned from V. alginolyticus wild-type strain HY9901, is 861 bp 
encoding a protein of 286 amino acids. The ΔexsA was constructed by homologous 
recombination and Overlap-PCR. Although there was no difference in growth 
between HY9901 and ΔexsA, the ΔexsA exhibited significantly decreased 
extracellular protease activity and biofilm formation. Besides, the ΔexsA showed 
a weakened swarming phenotype and an ~100-fold decrease in virulence to 
zebrafish. Antibiotic susceptibility testing showed the HY9901ΔexsA was more 
sensitive to kanamycin, minocycline, tetracycline, gentamicin, doxycycline and 
neomycin. Compared to HY9901 there were 541 up-regulated genes and 663 
down-regulated genes in ΔexsA, screened by transcriptome sequencing. qRT-PCR and 
β-galactosidase reporter assays were used to analyze the transcription levels of 
hop gene revealing that exsA gene could facilitate the expression of hop gene. 
Finally, Danio rerio, vaccinated with ΔexsA through intramuscular injection, 
induced a relative percent survival (RPS) value of 66.7% after challenging with 
HY9901 wild type strain. qRT-PCR assays showed that vaccination with ΔexsA 
increased the expression of immune-related genes, including GATA-1, IL6, IgM, 
and TNF-α in zebrafish. In summary, these results demonstrate the importance of 
exsA in V. alginolyticus and provide a basis for further investigations into the 
virulence and infection mechanism.

Common fragrance chemicals activate dendritic cells in coculture with 
keratinocytes.

Peter N(1), Lichter J(1), Hagvall L(2), Bock U(1), Blömeke B(1).

BACKGROUND: Fragrances are important contact allergens; however, investigation 
of their skin sensitization potency has been challenging in new approach methods 
(NAMs). Many fragrance chemicals are susceptible to autoxidation or can be 
metabolized by enzymes constitutively expressed in skin keratinocytes. Strong 
sensitizers can be formed in both of these processes. Further, keratinocytes can 
modulate the dendritic cell (DC) activation and maturation potential, a key 
event in the acquisition of contact allergy.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the 2D coculture model consisting of keratinocytes and 
DCs using different weak to moderate sensitizing fragrance chemicals. Further, 
to investigate fragrances and related oxidation products in the in vitro model 
and compare to in vivo data.
METHODS: Chemicals were tested in the coculture activation test (COCAT), 
consisting of HaCaT keratinocytes and THP-1 cells. THP-1 cell surface expression 
of costimulatory and adhesion molecules (CD86 and CD54) collected after 24 h 
incubation with the chemicals was analysed using flow cytometry.
RESULTS: Twenty-four molecules were tested positive, three were negative 
(n = 27). Four pairs were evaluated, with aldehydes showing a 6- to 13-fold 
stronger responses compared to their corresponding alcohols.
CONCLUSIONS: Results provide insight into the activation of DC in their natural 
environment of keratinocytes. α,β-Unsaturated alcohols were classified as weaker 
sensitizers compared to their corresponding aldehydes. In sum, testing of 
fragrances retrieved results in good agreement with in vivo data.

Activation of the Acute-Phase Response in Hemophilia.

Knowles LM(1), Wolter C(1), Menger MD(2), Laschke MW(2), Beyer L(1), Grün U(3), 
Eichler H(1), Pilch J(1).

To identify recurrent inflammation in hemophilia, we assessed the acute-phase 
response in the blood of patients with hemophilia A and B. Compared to age- and 
weight-matched controls, blood levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive 
protein (CRP), and LPS-binding protein (LBP) were significantly elevated in the 
entire cohort of hemophilia patients but exhibited a particularly pronounced 
increase in obese hemophilia patients with a body mass index (BMI) ≥30. Subgroup 
analysis of the remaining nonobese hemophilia patients (BMI: 18-29.9) revealed a 
significant spike of IL-6, CRP, and LBP in connection with a de-novo increase of 
soluble IL-6 receptor α (sIL-6Rα) in patients with bleeding events within the 
last month. Hemophilia patients who did not experience recent bleeding had IL-6, 
CRP, and sIL-6Rα blood levels similar to healthy controls. We did not find 
increased IL-6 or acute-phase reactants in hemophilia patients with arthropathy 
or infectious disease. The role of IL-6 as a marker of bleeding in hemophilia 
was confirmed in hemophilia patients with acute bleeding events as well as in 
transgenic hemophilia mice after needle puncture of the knee, which exhibited an 
extensive hematoma and a 150-fold increase of IL-6 blood levels within 7 days of 
the injury compared to needle-punctured control mice. Notably, IL-6 blood levels 
shrunk to a fourfold elevation in hemophilia mice over controls after 28 days, 
when the hematoma was replaced by arthrofibrosis. These findings indicate that 
acute-phase reactants in combination with sIL-6Rα could be sensitive biomarkers 
for the detection of acute and recent bleeding events in hemophilia.

Structure-activity relationship of GPR15L peptide analogues and investigation of 
their interaction with the GPR15 receptor.

Deng Y(1), Perez Almeria CV(1), van Gijzel L(1), Schaller K(1), Vedel L(1), 
Gloriam DE(1), Ulven T(1), Bräuner-Osborne H(1).

The 57-mer full-length GPR15L(25-81) peptide has been identified as the 
principal endogenous agonist of the G protein-coupled receptor GPR15. Its main 
activity resides in the C-terminal 11-mer GPR15L(71-81), which has full efficacy 
but ~40-fold lower potency than the full-length peptide. Here, we systematically 
investigated the structure-activity relationship of GPR15L(71-81) by 
truncations/extensions, alanine-scanning, and N- and C-terminal capping. The 
synthesized peptide analogues were tested at GPR15 stably expressed in HEK293A 
cells using a homogenous time-resolved Förster resonance energy transfer-based 
Gi cAMP functional assay. We show that the C-terminal α carboxyl group and the 
residues Leu78 , Pro75 , Val74 , and Trp72 are critical for receptor interaction 
and contribute significantly to the peptide potency. Furthermore, we tested the 
ability of GPR15L(71-81), C-terminally amidated GPR15L(71-81), and GPR15L(25-81) 
to activate the three GPR15 receptor mutants in a bioluminescence resonance 
energy transfer-based G protein activation assay. The results demonstrate that 
the Lys192 and Glu272 residues in GPR15 are important for the potency of the 
GPR15L peptide. Overall, our study identifies critical residues in the peptide 
and receptor sequences for future drug design.

Base-Exchange Enabling the Visualization of SARM1 Activities in Sciatic 
Nerve-Injured Mice.

Huang K(1), Zhu WJ(2), Li WH(2)(3)(4), Lee HC(2), Zhao YJ(2)(3)(5), Lee CS(1).

Enzymes are important in homeostasis in living organisms. Since abnormal enzyme 
activities are highly associated with many human diseases, detection of in vivo 
activities of a specific enzyme is important to study the pathology of the 
related diseases. In this work, we have designed and synthesized a series of new 
small-molecule-activatable fluorescent probes for the imaging of Sterile Alpha 
and TIR Motif-containing 1 (SARM1) activities based on its transglycosidase 
activities (base-exchange reactions of NAD+). Probe 1a was found to undergo 
base-exchange reactions with NAD+ in the presence of activated SARM1 but not 
CD38 nor NADase and formed a highly emissive product AD-1a [about a 100-fold 
fluorescence enhancement in 20 min with a 150 nm (5665 cm-1) Stokes shift and a 
100 nm (3812 cm-1) red shift]. This probe exhibited a higher reactivity and 
sensitivity than those commonly used for SARM1 imaging. The utilities of 1a have 
also been demonstrated in live-cell imaging and detection of in vivo activities 
of SARM1 in a sciatic nerve injury mouse model.

Heliorhodopsin Helps Photolyase to Enhance the DNA Repair Capacity.

Shim JG(#)(1), Cho SG(#)(1)(2), Kim SH(#)(1), Chuon K(1), Meas S(1), Choi A(3), 
Jung KH(1).

Light quality is a significant factor for living organisms that have 
photosensory systems, such as rhodopsin, a seven alpha-helical transmembrane 
protein with the retinal chromophore. Here, we report, for the first time, the 
function of new rhodopsin, which is an inverted 7-transmembrane protein, 
isolated from Trichococcus flocculiformis. T. flocculiformis heliorhodopsin 
(TfHeR) works as a regulatory helper rhodopsin that binds with class 2 
cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPDII) photolyase to broaden the spectrum and 
upregulate DNA repair activity. We have confirmed their interaction through 
isothermal titration calorimetry (dissociation constant of 21.7 μM) and 
identified the charged residues for the interaction. Based on in vivo and in 
vitro experiments, we showed that the binding of heliorhodopsin with photolyase 
improved photolyase activity by about 3-fold to repair UV-caused DNA damage. 
Also, the DNA repair activity of TfHeR/T. flocculiformis photolyase (TfPHR) was 
observed in the presence of green light. Our results suggested that 
heliorhodopsin directly controls the activity of photolyase and coevolves to 
broaden the activity spectrum by protein-protein interaction. IMPORTANCE This 
study reports a function for Heliorhodopsin working as a regulatory helper 
rhodopsin that with CPDII photolyase to broaden the spectrum and upregulating 
the DNA repair activity. Our results suggested that heliorhodopsin directly 
controls photolyase activity and coevolves to broaden the DNA repair capacity by 
protein-protein interaction.

Engineering enhanced thermostability into the Geobacillus pallidus nitrile 
hydratase.

Van Wyk JC(1)(2)(3), Sewell BT(4)(5), Danson MJ(6), Tsekoa TL(1)(2)(7), Sayed 
MF(1)(2), Cowan DA(1)(2)(8).

Nitrile hydratases (NHases) are important biocatalysts for the enzymatic 
conversion of nitriles to industrially-important amides such as acrylamide and 
nicotinamide. Although thermostability in this enzyme class is generally low, 
there is not sufficient understanding of its basis for rational enzyme design. 
The gene expressing the Co-type NHase from the moderate thermophile, Geobacillus 
pallidus RAPc8 (NRRL B-59396), was subjected to random mutagenesis. Four mutants 
were selected that were 3 to 15-fold more thermostable than the wild-type NHase, 
resulting in a 3.4-7.6 ​kJ/mol increase in the activation energy of thermal 
inactivation at 63 ​°C. High resolution X-ray crystal structures (1.15-1.80 ​Å) 
were obtained of the wild-type and four mutant enzymes. Mutant 9E, with a 
resolution of 1.15 ​Å, is the highest resolution crystal structure obtained for 
a nitrile hydratase to date. Structural comparisons between the wild-type and 
mutant enzymes illustrated the importance of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds in 
enhancing NHase thermostability. These additional interactions variously 
improved thermostability by increased intra- and inter-subunit interactions, 
preventing cooperative unfolding of α-helices and stabilising loop regions. Some 
hydrogen bonds were mediated via a water molecule, specifically highlighting the 
significance of structured water molecules in protein thermostability. Although 
knowledge of the mutant structures makes it possible to rationalize their 
behaviour, it would have been challenging to predict in advance that these 
mutants would be stabilising.

Structural insights of a putative β-1,4-xylosidase (PsGH43F) of glycoside 
hydrolase family 43 from Pseudopedobacter saltans.

Yadav V(1), Ahmed J(1), Thakur A(2), Vishwakarma P(3), Singh S(1), Kaur P(3), 
Goyal A(4).

Structural and conformational insights of a putative β-1,4-xylosidase (PsGH43F) 
of glycoside hydrolase family 43 from Pseudopedobacter saltans were investigated 
by computational and Circular Dichroism (CD) analyses. PsGH43F was cloned and 
expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells and the purified enzyme gave the size 
~50 kDa on SDS-PAGE analysis. Multiple Sequence Alignment of PsGH43F sequence 
followed by superposition of modeled structure with homologous structures 
displayed the presence of three conserved catalytic amino acid residues, Asp33, 
Asp149 and Glu212. The secondary structure analysis by CD showed 2.72 % α-helix 
and 36.06 % β-strands. The homology modeled structure of PsGH43F displayed a 
5-bladed β-propeller fold for catalytic module at N-terminal and a β-sandwich 
structure for CBM6 at the C-terminal. Ramachandran plot displayed 99.5 % of 
residues in the allowed regions. MD simulation of PsGH43F revealed the 
compactness and stability of the structure. Molecular docking studies of PsGH43F 
with xylo-oligosaccharides revealed its maximum binding affinity for xylobiose. 
MD simulation of PsGH43F-xylobiose complex confirmed the increased structural 
and conformational stability in presence of substrate. The Hydrodynamic diameter 
analysis of PsGH43F by DLS was in the range, 0.25-0.28 μm.

Cross-Species Analysis of Innate Immune Antagonism by Cytomegalovirus IE1 
Protein.

Rothemund F(1), Scherer M(1), Schilling EM(1), Schweininger J(2), Muller YA(2), 
Stamminger T(1).

The human cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate early 1 (IE1) protein has evolved as a 
multifunctional antagonist of intrinsic and innate immune mechanisms. In 
addition, this protein serves as a transactivator and potential genome 
maintenance protein. Recently, the crystal structures of the human and rat CMV 
IE1 (hIE1, rIE1) core domain were solved. Despite low sequence identity, the 
respective structures display a highly similar, all alpha-helical fold with 
distinct variations. To elucidate which activities of IE1 are either 
species-specific or conserved, this study aimed at a comparative analysis of 
hIE1 and rIE1 functions. To facilitate the quantitative evaluation of 
interactions between IE1 and cellular proteins, a sensitive NanoBRET assay was 
established. This confirmed the species-specific interaction of IE1 with the 
cellular restriction factor promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) and with the 
DNA replication factor flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1). To characterize the 
respective binding surfaces, helix exchange mutants were generated by swapping 
hIE1 helices with the corresponding rIE1 helices. Interestingly, while all 
mutants were defective for PML binding, loss of FEN1 interaction was confined to 
the exchange of helices 1 and 2, suggesting that FEN1 binds to the stalk region 
of IE1. Furthermore, our data reveal that both hIE1 and rIE1 antagonize human 
STAT2; however, distinct regions of the respective viral proteins mediated the 
interaction. Finally, while PML, FEN1, and STAT2 binding were conserved between 
primate and rodent proteins, we detected that rIE1 lacks a chromatin tethering 
function suggesting that this activity is dispensable for rat CMV. In 
conclusion, our study revealed conserved and distinct functions of primate and 
rodent IE1 proteins, further supporting the concept that IE1 proteins underwent 
a narrow co-evolution with their respective hosts to maximize their efficacy in 
antagonizing innate immune mechanisms and supporting viral replication.

Spatial growth rate of emerging SARS-CoV-2 lineages in England, September 
2020-December 2021.

Smallman-Raynor MR(1), Cliff AD(2); COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) Consortium.

This paper uses a robust method of spatial epidemiological analysis to assess 
the spatial growth rate of multiple lineages of SARS-CoV-2 in the local 
authority areas of England, September 2020-December 2021. Using the genomic 
surveillance records of the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) Consortium, the 
analysis identifies a substantial (7.6-fold) difference in the average rate of 
spatial growth of 37 sample lineages, from the slowest (Delta AY.4.3) to the 
fastest (Omicron BA.1). Spatial growth of the Omicron (B.1.1.529 and BA) variant 
was found to be 2.81× faster than the Delta (B.1.617.2 and AY) variant and 3.76× 
faster than the Alpha (B.1.1.7 and Q) variant. In addition to AY.4.2 (a 
designated variant under investigation, VUI-21OCT-01), three Delta sublineages 
(AY.43, AY.98 and AY.120) were found to display a statistically faster rate of 
spatial growth than the parent lineage and would seem to merit further 
investigation. We suggest that the monitoring of spatial growth rates is a 
potentially valuable adjunct to outbreak response procedures for emerging 
SARS-CoV-2 variants in a defined population.

Undescribed glucosylceramide, flavonol triglycoside, and oleanane saponin from 
the halophyte Agathophora alopecuroides: Promising candidates for stimulating 
ceramide synthesis.

Othman A(1), Amen Y(2), Nagata M(3), Shimizu K(4).

The phytochemical study of Agathophora alopecuroides (Chenopodiaceae) led to the 
isolation of previously undescribed glucosylceramide, flavonol triglycoside, and 
triterpene oleanane saponin, together with eight known compounds. Their 
structures were elucidated using NMR analysis and HR-MS as (2'R, 12E) N-[(2S, 
3S, 
4R)-1-(β-D-glucopyranosyloxy)-3,4-dihydroxy-octadec-2-yl]-2-hydroxytetracos-12-enamide, 
namely Agathophamide A; 
isorhamnetin-3-O-[β-D-xylopyranosyl-(1→3)-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→6)]-β-D-galactopyranoside, 
namely Agathophoroside A; and 
3-O-[4'-(β-D-xylopyranosyl)-β-D-glucuronopyranosyl]-28-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-olean-12-en-3β-ol-28-oic 
acid, namely Solysaponin A. We evaluated the effect of extract and isolates on 
ceramide levels via the up-regulated expression of the enzyme for ceramide 
synthesis in HaCaT keratinocytes. Interestingly, the study results revealed that 
the methanol extract of A. alopecuroides, together with some isolated compounds 
significantly up-regulated the mRNA expression of ceramide synthase-3 by 1.2- to 
4.3-fold compared with the control in HaCaT cells. These findings indicate that 
the halophyte A. alopecuroides is a promising source of candidate compounds that

Modification of corn starch using ultrasonic waves to improve its freeze-thaw 
resistance in frozen model doughs and buns. Analysis was performed by rheometry, 
low-field-intensity nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, Fourier infrared 
spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The results showed that the 
addition of ultrasonically modified corn starch reduced the migration of water 
molecules inside the model dough, weakened the decrease of elastic modulus, and 
enhanced the creep recovery effect; the decrease in α-helical and β-fold content 
in the model dough was reduced, the destruction of internal network structure 
was decreased, the exposed starch granules were reduced, and the internal 
interaction of the dough was enhanced; the texture of the buns became softer and 
the moisture content increased. In conclusion, ultrasound as a physical 
modification means can significantly improve the freeze-thaw properties of corn 
starch, providing new ideas for the development and quality improvement of 
corn-starch-based instant frozen pasta products.

N-terminal PPE domain plays an integral role in extracellular transportation and 
stability of the immunomodulatory Rv3539 protein of the Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis.

Anand PK(1), Kaur G(2), Saini V(3), Kaur J(4), Kaur J(5).

Multigene PE/PPE family is exclusively present in mycobacterium species. Only 
few selected genes of this family have been characterized till date. Rv3539 was 
annotated as PPE63 with conserved PPE domain at N-terminal and PE-PPE at 
C-terminal. An α/β hydrolase structural fold, characteristic of lipase/esterase, 
was present in the PE-PPE domain. To assign the biochemical function to Rv3539, 
the corresponding gene was cloned in pET-32a (+) as full-length, PPE, and PE-PPE 
domains individually, followed by expression in E. Coli C41 (DE3). All three 
proteins demonstrated esterase activity. However, the enzyme activity in the 
N-terminal PPE domain was very low. The enzyme activity of Rv3539 and PE-PPE 
proteins was approximately same with the pNP-C4 as optimum substrate at 40 °C 
and pH 8.0. The loss of enzyme activity after mutating the predicted catalytic 
triad (Ser296Ala, Asp369Ala, and His395Ala) found only in the PE-PPE domain, 
confirmed the candidature of the bioinformatically predicted active site 
residue. The optimal activity and thermostability of the Rv3539 protein was 
altered by removing the PPE domain. CD-spectroscopy analysis confirmed the role 
of PPE domain to the thermostability of Rv3539 by maintaining the structural 
integrity at higher temperatures. The presence of the N-terminal PPE domain 
directed the Rv3539 protein to the cell membrane/wall and the extracellular 
compartment. The Rv3539 protein could generate humoral response in TB patients. 
Therefore, results demonstrated that Rv3539 demonstrated esterase activity. 
PE-PPE domain of Rv3539 is functionally automated, however, N-terminus domain 
played a role in protein stabilization and its transportation. Both domains 
participated in immunomodulation.

Parallel expansion and divergence of an adhesin family in pathogenic yeasts.

Smoak RA(1), Snyder LF(2), Fassler JS(2)(3), He BZ(2)(3).

Opportunistic yeast pathogens arose multiple times in the Saccharomycetes class, 
including the recently emerged, multidrug-resistant (MDR) Candida auris. We show 
that homologs of a known yeast adhesin family in Candida albicans, the 
Hyr/Iff-like (Hil) family, are enriched in distinct clades of Candida species as 
a result of multiple, independent expansions. Following gene duplication, the 
tandem repeat-rich region in these proteins diverged extremely rapidly and 
generated large variations in length and β-aggregation potential, both of which 
are known to directly affect adhesion. The conserved N-terminal effector domain 
was predicted to adopt a β-helical fold followed by an α-crystallin domain, 
making it structurally similar to a group of unrelated bacterial adhesins. 
Evolutionary analyses of the effector domain in C. auris revealed relaxed 
selective constraint combined with signatures of positive selection, suggesting 
functional diversification after gene duplication. Lastly, we found the Hil 
family genes to be enriched at chromosomal ends, which likely contributed to 
their expansion via ectopic recombination and break-induced replication. 
Combined, these results suggest that the expansion and diversification of 
adhesin families generate variation in adhesion and virulence within and between 
species and are a key step toward the emergence of fungal pathogens.

Consolidating the gelling performance of myofibrillar protein using a novel 
OSA-modified-starch-stabilized Pickering emulsion filler: Effect of starches 
with distinct crystalline types.

Wang Q(1), Luan Y(1), Tang Z(1), Li Z(1), Gu C(1), Liu R(1), Ge Q(1), Yu H(1), 
Wu M(2).

Starch-stabilized Pickering emulsions were employed as a novel particulate 
filler in myofibrillar protein (MP)-based gels for improving the gelling 
characteristics. The role of emulsions prepared by native starches (NS) with 
distinctive crystalline types (i.e., A-type waxy corn starch, B-type potato 
starch, and C-type pea starch) and their OSA-modified counterparts (A-OS, B-OS, 
C-OS) in the gelling performance was evaluated and compared with 
MP-stabilized-emulsion. Compared with MP-emulsion, starch-emulsion caused 
substantial increases in the gelling properties, notably for OSA-starch 
emulsions. Herein, A-OS exhibited up to 1.26-, 5.3-, and 2.9-fold increments in 
storage modulus, gel strength, and water holding capacity relative to pure MP 
gel, respectively, higher than B-OS and C-OS. Moreover, light microscopy evinced 
a more compact gel network filled with smaller and uniform oil droplets when 
A-OS emulsions were incorporated into the gels. The addition of OSA-starch 
emulsions, especially A-OS emulsion, facilitated the protein conformational 
conversion from α-helix to β-sheet and caused a marked reduction of free 
sulfhydryls in the gels; yet, the chemical forces that stabilized the gels 
altered, where remarkable reinforcements in hydrogen bond and hydrophobic 
interaction were detected, in support of the construction of splendid MP gels. 
Hence, OSA-starch emulsions show promise as functional components in meat 
products.

Exhaustive Cross-Linking Search with Protein Feedback.

Zhou C(1), Dai S(2), Lin Y(1), Lian S(1), Fan X(3), Li N(2)(4), Yu W(1)(4).

Improving the sensitivity of protein-protein interaction detection and protein 
structure probing is a principal challenge in cross-linking mass spectrometry 
(XL-MS) data analysis. In this paper, we propose an exhaustive cross-linking 
search method with protein feedback (ECL-PF) for cleavable XL-MS data analysis. 
ECL-PF adopts an optimized α/β mass detection scheme and establishes 
protein-peptide association during the identification of cross-linked peptides. 
Existing major scoring functions can all benefit from the ECL-PF workflow to a 
great extent. In comparisons using synthetic data sets and hybrid simulated data 
sets, ECL-PF achieved 3-fold higher sensitivity over standard techniques. In 
experiments using real data sets, it also identified 65.6% more cross-link 
spectrum matches and 48.7% more unique cross-links.

Kim YT(3), Kim KC(2), Kim JY(4), Na KJ(3), Lee JY(2), Ju YS(1)(4).

With the continuous emergence of highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants, the 
comparison of their infectivity has become a critical issue for public health. 
However, a direct assessment of the viral characteristic has been challenging 
because of the lack of appropriate experimental models and efficient methods. 
Here, we integrated human alveolar organoids and single-cell transcriptome 
sequencing to facilitate the evaluation. In a proof-of-concept study with four 
highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants, including GR (B.1.1.119), Alpha 
(B.1.1.7), Delta (B.1.617.2), and Omicron (BA.1), a rapid evaluation of the 
relative infectivity was possible. Our system demonstrates that the Omicron 
variant is 5- to 7-fold more infectious to human alveolar cells than the other 
SARS-CoV-2 variants at the initial stage of infection. To our knowledge, for the 
first time, this study measures the relative infectivity of the Omicron variant 
under multiple virus co-infection and provides new experimental procedures that 
can be applied to monitor emerging viral variants.

Biophysical description of Bromosulfophthalein interaction with the 28-kDa 
glutathione transferase from Schistosoma japonicum.

Pooe K(1), Thulo M(1), Makumbe H(1), Akumadu B(1), Otun O(1), Aloke C(1), 
Achilonu I(2).

Glutathione transferases (GSTs) are major detoxification enzymes vital for the 
survival and reproduction of schistosomes during infection in humans. 
Schistosoma encode two GST isoenzymes, the 26- and 28-kDa isoforms, that show 
different substrate specificities and cellular localisations. 
Bromosulfophthalein (BSP) has been identified and characterised as a potent 
26-kDa Schistosoma japonicum GST (Sj26GST) inhibitor with an anthelmintic 
potential. This study describes the structure, function, and ligandin properties 
of the 28-kDa Schistosoma japonicum GST (Sj28GST) towards BSP. Enzyme kinetics 
show that BSP is a potent enzyme inhibitor, with a specific activity decreases 
from 60.4 µmol/min/mg to 0.0742 µmol/min/mg and an IC50 in the micromolar range 
of 0.74 µM. Far-UV circular dichroism confirmed that purified Sj28GST follows a 
typical GST fold, which is predominantly alpha-helical. Fluorescence 
spectroscopy suggests that BSP binding occurs at a site distinct from the 
glutathione-binding site (G-site); however, the binding does not alter the local 
G-site environment. Isothermal titration calorimetry studies show that the 
binding of BSP to Sj28GST is exergonic (∆G°= -33 kJ/mol) and 
enthalpically-driven, with a stoichiometry of one BSP per dimer. The stability 
of Sj28GST (∆G(H2O) = 4.7 kcal/mol) is notably lower than Sj26GST, owing to 
differences in the enzyme's dimeric interfaces. We conclude that Sj28GST shares 
similar biophysical characteristics with Sj26GST based on its kinetic properties 
and susceptibility to low concentrations of BSP. The study supports the 
potential benefits of re-purposing BSP as a potential drug or prodrug to 
mitigate the scourge of schistosomiasis.

Erratum in
    Nat Biotechnol. 2022 Oct 17;:

AlphaFold2 and related computational systems predict protein structure using 
deep learning and co-evolutionary relationships encoded in multiple sequence 
alignments (MSAs). Despite high prediction accuracy achieved by these systems, 
challenges remain in (1) prediction of orphan and rapidly evolving proteins for 
which an MSA cannot be generated; (2) rapid exploration of designed structures; 
and (3) understanding the rules governing spontaneous polypeptide folding in 
solution. Here we report development of an end-to-end differentiable recurrent 
geometric network (RGN) that uses a protein language model (AminoBERT) to learn 
latent structural information from unaligned proteins. A linked geometric module 
compactly represents Cα backbone geometry in a translationally and rotationally 
invariant way. On average, RGN2 outperforms AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAFold on orphan 
proteins and classes of designed proteins while achieving up to a 106-fold 
reduction in compute time. These findings demonstrate the practical and 
theoretical strengths of protein language models relative to MSAs in structure 
prediction.

A strategy to promote carotenoids production in Dunaliella bardawil by melatonin 
combined with photoinduction.

Xie SR(1), Li Y(1), Chen HH(1), Liang MH(2), Jiang JG(3).

Microalgae are considered to be a very promising class of raw material for 
carotenoid production. In this study, melatonin (MLT), a widely used plant 
growth regulator, was added to the autotrophic medium of Dunaliella bardawil to 
explore its effects on the growth and pigment accumulation of Dunaliella 
bardawil. The results showed that the induction of exogenous MLT alone was not 
beneficial to the growth and pigment accumulation of Dunaliella bardawil, and 
the higher the concentration, the more obvious the inhibitory effect on the 
algal cells. Therefore, a strategy to promote carotenoid accumulation in 
Dunaliella bardawil by combining exogenous MLT and light induction was carried 
out. Under 4500 LUX light intensity, the content of zeaxanthin was significantly 
increased under exogenous MLT induction. In the 200 μg/mL, 300 μg/mL, and 
400 μg/mL MLT-treated groups, the zeaxanthin single-cell content in the 
300 μg/mL-treated group was as high as 0.38 ng/mL (0.17 ng/mL in the control 
group), which was 1.24-fold higher compared to the control. Under 9500 LUX light 
intensity, all carotenoids showed an increasing trend in all experimental 
groups, except for zeaxanthin, which showed a decreasing trend. The effect of 
300 μg/mL showed the most obvious in the 200 μg/mL,300 μg/mL, and 400 μg/mL MLT 
treatment groups, where the lutein, α-carotene and β-carotene contents were 
1.24, 1.14 and 1.31 times higher than those of the control group, respectively. 
Overall, exogenous MLT at high light intensities had a significant effect on 
pigment accumulation in Dunaliella bardawil.

Superanionic Solvent-Free Liquid Enzymes Exhibit Enhanced Structures and 
Activities.

Petersen SV(5), Pedersen JS(3), Perriman A(6), Gao R(1), Guo Z(2).

The surface of a carboxylate-enriched octuple mutant of Bacillus subtilis lipase 
A (8M) is chemically anionized to produce core (8M)-shell (cationic polymer 
surfactants) bionanoconjugates in protein liquid form, which are termed 
anion-type biofluids. The resultant lipase biofluids exhibit a 2.5-fold increase 
in hydrolytic activity when compared with analogous lipase biofluids based on 
anionic polymer surfactants. In addition, the applicability of the anion-type 
biofluid using Myoglobin (Mb) that is well studied in anion-type solvent-free 
liquid proteins is evaluated. Although anionization resulted in the complete 
unfolding of Mb, the active α-helix level is partially recovered in the 
anion-type biofluids, and the effect is accentuated in the cation-type Mb 
biofluids. These highly active anion-type solvent-free liquid enzymes exhibit 
increased thermal stability and provide a new direction in solvent-free liquid 
protein research.

Allele-Specific Chemical Rescue of Histone Demethylases Using Abiotic Cofactors.

Scott V(1), Dey D(1), Kuwik J(1), Hinkelman K(1), Waldman M(1), Islam K(1).

Closely related protein families evolved from common ancestral genes present a 
significant hurdle in developing member- and isoform-specific chemical probes, 
owing to their similarity in fold and function. In this piece of work, we 
explore an allele-specific chemical rescue strategy to activate a "dead" variant 
of a wildtype protein using synthetic cofactors and demonstrate its successful 
application to the members of the alpha-ketoglutarate (αKG)-dependent histone 
demethylase 4 (KDM4) family. We show that a mutation at a specific residue in 
the catalytic site renders the variant inactive toward the natural cosubstrate. 
In contrast, αKG derivatives bearing appropriate stereoelectronic features 
endowed the mutant with native-like demethylase activity while remaining 
refractory to a set of wild type dioxygenases. The orthogonal enzyme-cofactor 
pairs demonstrated site- and degree-specific lysine demethylation on a 
full-length chromosomal histone in the cellular milieu. Our work offers a 
strategy to modulate a specific histone demethylase by identifying and 
engineering a conserved phenylalanine residue, which acts as a gatekeeper in the 
KDM4 subfamily, to sensitize the enzyme toward a novel set of αKG derivatives. 
The orthogonal pairs developed herein will serve as probes to study the role of 
degree-specific lysine demethylation in mammalian gene expression. Furthermore, 
this approach to overcome active site degeneracy is expected to have general 
application among all human αKG-dependent dioxygenases.

Single-mutations at the galactose-binding site of enzymes GalK, GalU and LgtC 
enable the efficient synthesis of UDP-6-azido-6-deoxy-D-galactose and 
azido-functionalized Gb3 analogs.

Ortiz-Soto ME(1), Baier M(1), Brenner D(1), Timm M(1), Seibel J(1).

Lysosomal accumulation of the glycosphingolipid globotriaosylceramide Gb3 is 
linked to the deficient activity of the α-galactosidase A in the Anderson-Fabry 
disease and an elevated level of deacylated Gb3 (lyso-Gb3) is a hallmark of this 
condition. Localization of Gb3 in the plasma membrane is critical for studying 
how the membrane organization and its dynamics are affected in this genetic 
disorder. Gb3 analogs containing a terminal 6-azido-functionalized galactose in 
its head group globotriose (αGal1,4βGal1,4Glc) are attractive chemical reporters 
for bioimaging, as the azido-group may act as a chemical tag for bio-orthogonal 
click chemistry. We report here the production of azido-Gb3 analogs employing 
mutants of GalK, GalU and LgtC enzymes, which participate in the synthesis of 
the sugar motif globotriose. Variants of enzymes GalK/GalU generate 
UDP-6-azido-6-deoxy-d-galactose (UDP-6AzGal), which is the galactosyl-donor used 
by LgtC for transferring the terminal galactose moiety to lactosyl-acceptors. 
Residues at the galactose-binding site of the three enzymes were modified to 
facilitate the accommodation of azido-functionalized substrates and variants 
outperforming the wild-type enzymes were characterized. Synthesis of 
6-azido-6-deoxy-d-galactose-1-phosphate, UDP-6AzGal and azido-Gb3 analogs by 
variants GalK-E37S, GalU-D133V and LgtC-Q187S, respectively, is 3- to 6-fold 
that of their wild-type counterparts. Coupled reactions with these variants 
permit the production of the pricy, unnatural galactosyl-donor UDP-6AzGal with 
~90 percent conversion yields and products AzGlobotriose and lyso-AzGb3 with 
substrate conversion of up to 70 percent. AzGb3 analogs could serve as 
precursors for the synthesis of other tagged glycosphingolipids of the 
globo-series.

In silico annotation of a hypothetical protein from Listeria monocytogenes EGD-e 
unfolds a toxin protein of the type II secretion system.

Tasneem M(1), Gupta SD(1), Momin MB(1), Hossain KM(1), Osman TB(1), Rabbi MF(1).

The gram-positive bacterium Listeria monocytogenes is an important foodborne 
intracellular pathogen that is widespread in the environment. The functions of 
hypothetical proteins (HP) from various pathogenic bacteria have been 
successfully annotated using a variety of bioinformatics strategies. In this 
study, a HP Imo0888 (NP_464414.1) from the Listeria monocytogenes EGD-e strain 
was annotated using several bioinformatics tools. Various techniques, including 
CELLO, PSORTb, and SOSUIGramN, identified the candidate protein as cytoplasmic. 
Domain and motif analysis revealed that the target protein is a PemK/MazFlike 
toxin protein of the type II toxin-antitoxin system (TAS) which was consistent 
with BLASTp analysis. Through secondary structure analysis, we found the random 
coil to be the most frequent. The Alpha Fold 2 Protein Structure Prediction 
Database was used to determine the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the HP 
using the template structure of a type II TAS PemK/MazF family toxin protein (DB 
ID_AFDB: A0A4B9HQB9) with 99.1% sequence identity. Various quality evaluation 
tools, such as PROCHECK, ERRAT, Verify 3D, and QMEAN were used to validate the 
3D structure. Following the YASARA energy minimization method, the target 
protein's 3D structure became more stable. The active site of the developed 3D 
structure was determined by the CASTp server. Most pathogens that harbor TAS 
create a crucial risk to human health. Our aim to annotate the HP Imo088 found 
in Listeria could offer a chance to understand bacterial pathogenicity and 
identify a number of potential targets for drug development.

Can targeted nanoparticles distinguish cancer metastasis from inflammation?

Lorkowski M(1), Ndamira C(1), Gopalakrishnan R(1), Krishnamurthy A(1), Schiemann 
WP(2), Karathanasis E(3).

Targeting ligands have been widely used to increase the intratumoral 
accumulation of nanoparticles and their uptake by cancer cells. However, these 
ligands aim at targets that are often also upregulated in inflamed tissues. 
Here, we assessed the ability of targeted nanoparticles to distinguish 
metastatic cancer from sites of inflammation. Using common targeting ligands and 
a 60-nm liposome as a representative nanoparticle, we generated three targeted 
nanoparticle (NP) variants that targeted either fibronectin, folate, or αvβ3 
integrin, whose deposition was compared against that of standard untargeted NP. 
Using fluorescently labeled NPs and ex vivo fluorescence imaging of organs, we 
assessed the deposition of the NPs into the lungs of mice modeling 4 different 
biological landscapes, including healthy lungs, aggressive metastasis in lungs, 
dormant/latent metastasis in lungs, and lungs with general pulmonary 
inflammation. Among the four NP variants, fibronectin-targeting NP and 
untargeted NP exhibited the highest deposition in lungs harboring aggressive 
metastases. However, the deposition of all targeted NP variants in lungs with 
metastasis was similar to the deposition in lungs with inflammation. Only the 
untargeted NP was able to exhibit higher deposition in metastasis than 
inflammation. Moreover, flow-cytometry analysis showed all NP variants 
accumulated predominantly in immune cells rather than cancer cells. For example, 
the number of NP+ macrophages and dendritic cells was 16-fold greater than NP+ 
cancer cells in the case of fibronectin-targeting NP. Overall, targeted NPs were 
unable to distinguish cancer metastasis from general inflammation, which may 
have clinical implications to the nanoparticle-mediated delivery of cancer 
drugs.

Bacillus subtilis DSM29784 attenuates Clostridium perfringens-induced intestinal 
damage of broilers by modulating intestinal microbiota and the metabolome.

Wang Y(1), Xu Y(1), Cao G(2), Zhou X(3), Wang Q(4), Fu A(1), Zhan X(1).

Necrotic enteritis (NE), especially subclinical NE (SNE), without clinical 
symptoms, in chicks has become one of the most threatening problems to the 
poultry industry. Therefore, increasing attention has been focused on the 
research and application of effective probiotic strains as an alternative to 
antibiotics to prevent SNE in broilers. In the present study, we evaluated the 
effects of Bacillus subtilis DSM29784 (BS) on the prevention of subclinical 
necrotic enteritis (SNE) in broilers. A total of 480 1-day-old broiler chickens 
were randomly assigned to four dietary treatments, each with six replicates pens 
of twenty birds for 63 d. The negative (Ctr group) and positive (SNE group) 
groups were only fed a basal diet, while the two treatment groups received basal 
diets supplemented with BS (1 × 109 colony-forming units BS/kg) (BS group) and 
10mg/kg enramycin (ER group), respectively. On days 15, birds except those in 
the Ctr group were challenged with 20-fold dose coccidiosis vaccine, and then 
with 1 ml of C. perfringens (2 × 108) at days 18 to 21 for SNE induction. BS, 
similar to ER, effectively attenuated CP-induced poor growth performance. 
Moreover, BS pretreatment increased villi height, claudin-1 expression, maltase 
activity, and immunoglobulin abundance, while decreasing lesional scores, as 
well as mucosal IFN-γ and TNF-α concentrations. In addition, BS pretreatment 
increased the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria and decreased that of 
pathogenic species; many lipid metabolites were enriched in the cecum of treated 
chickens. These results suggest that BS potentially provides active ingredients 
that may serve as an antibiotic substitute, effectively preventing SNE-induced 
growth decline by enhancing intestinal health in broilers.

Solid-state fermentation of Apocynum venetum L. by Aspergillus niger: Effect on 
phenolic compounds, antioxidant activities and metabolic syndrome-associated 
enzymes.

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of solid-state fermentation (SSF) with 
Aspergillus niger on the total phenolic content (TPC), the total flavonoid 
content (TFC), individual phenolic contents, and antioxidant and inhibitory 
activities against metabolic syndrome-associated enzymes in an ethanol extract 
from Apocynum venetum L. (AVL). TPC, TFC, and the contents of quercetin and 
kaempferol during SSF were 1.52-, 1.33-, 3.64-, and 2.22-fold higher than those 
of native AVL in the ethyl acetate (EA) subfraction of the ethanol extract. The 
ABTS·+, DPPH· scavenging, and inhibitory activities against α-glucosidase and 
pancreatic lipase were found to be highest in the EA subfraction. Fermentation 
significantly increased the ABTS radical cation, DPPH radical scavenging, and 
pancreatic lipase inhibitory activities by 1.33, 1.39, and 1.28 times,

Disrupting N-Glycosylation Using Type I Mannosidase Inhibitors Alters B-Cell 
Receptor Signaling.

Huang A(1), Kurhade SE(2), Ross P(2), Apley KD(1), Griffin JD(3), Berkland 
CJ(1)(3)(4), Farrell MP(2).

Kifunensine is a known inhibitor of type I α-mannosidase enzymes and has been 
shown to have therapeutic potential for a variety of diseases and application in 
the expression of high-mannose N-glycan bearing glycoproteins; however, the 
compound's hydrophilic nature limits its efficacy. We previously synthesized two 
hydrophobic acylated derivatives of kifunensine, namely, JDW-II-004 and 
JDW-II-010, and found that these compounds were over 75-fold more potent than 
kifunensine. Here we explored the effects of these compounds on different mice 
and human B cells, and we demonstrate that they affected the cells in a similar 
fashion to kifunensine, further demonstrating their functional equivalence to 
kifunensine in assays utilizing primary cells. Specifically, a dose-dependent 
increase in the formation of high-mannose N-glycans decorated glycoproteins were 
observed upon treatment with kifunensine, JDW-II-004, and JDW-II-010, but 
greater potency was observed with the acylated derivatives. Treatment with 
kifunensine or the acylated derivatives also resulted in impaired B-cell 
receptor (BCR) signaling of the primary mouse B cells; however, primary human B 
cells treated with kifunensine or JDW-II-004 did not affect BCR signaling, while 
a modest increase in BCR signaling was observed upon treatment with JDW-010. 
Nevertheless, these findings demonstrate that the hydrophobic acylated 
derivatives of kifunensine can help overcome the mass-transfer limitations of 
the parent compound, and they may have applications for the treatment of 
ERAD-related diseases or prove to be more cost-effective alternatives for the 
generation and production of high-mannose N-glycan bearing glycoproteins.

Structures and nucleic acid-binding preferences of the eukaryotic ARID domain.

Korn SM(1), Schlundt A(1).

The DNA-binding AT-rich interactive domain (ARID) exists in a wide range of 
proteins throughout eukaryotic kingdoms. ARID domain-containing proteins are 
involved in manifold biological processes, such as transcriptional regulation, 
cell cycle control and chromatin remodeling. Their individual domain composition 
allows for a sub-classification within higher mammals. ARID is categorized as 
binder of double-stranded AT-rich DNA, while recent work has suggested ARIDs as 
capable of binding other DNA motifs and also recognizing RNA. Despite a broad 
variability on the primary sequence level, ARIDs show a highly conserved fold, 
which consists of six α-helices and two loop regions. Interestingly, this 
minimal core domain is often found extended by helices at the N- and/or 
C-terminus with potential roles in target specificity and, subsequently 
function. While high-resolution structural information from various types of 
ARIDs has accumulated over two decades now, there is limited access to ARID-DNA 
complex structures. We thus find ourselves left at the beginning of 
understanding ARID domain target specificities and the role of accompanying 
domains. Here, we systematically summarize ARID domain conservation and compare 
the various types with a focus on their structural differences and DNA-binding 
preferences, including the context of multiple other motifs within ARID domain 
containing proteins.

Profiling of idiopathic macular hole vitreous proteome identifies the role of 
extracellular matrix remodelling, epithelial-mesenchymal transformation and 
unfolded protein-response pathways.

Sen S(1), Udaya P(1), Maheshwari JJ(2), Ramasamy K(3), Kannan NB(3), 
Dharmalingam K(2).

PURPOSE: To analyze and describe the proteome of the vitreous humour in eyes 
with idiopathic macular holes.
METHODS: We performed mass spectrometry (MS)-based label-free quantitative 
analysis of the vitreous proteome of idiopathic macular hole (IMH) and control 
donor vitreous. Comparative quantification was performed using SCAFFOLD software 
which calculated fold changes of differential expression. Bioinformatics 
analysis was performed using DAVID and STRING software.
RESULTS: A total of 448 proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS in IMH and 
cadaveric eye vitreous samples, of which 199 proteins were common. IMH samples 
had 189 proteins that were unique and 60 proteins were present only in the 
control cadaveric vitreous. We found upregulation of several extracellular 
matrix (ECM) and cytoskeletal proteins, namely collagen alpha-1 (XVIII) chain, 
N-cadherin, EFEMP1/fibulin-3, basement membrane-specific heparan sulfate 
proteoglycan core protein, and target of Nesh-3. Several cytoskeleton proteins, 
namely tubulin, actin, and fibronectin levels, were significantly lower in IMH 
vitreous, probably reflecting increased ECM degradation. IMH vitreous also had a 
downregulation of unfolded protein response-mediated-mediated apoptosis 
proteins, possibly related to a state of increased cell survival and 
proliferation, along with a remodelling and aberrant production of ECM contents.
CONCLUSION: The pathogenesis of macular holes may involve ECM remodelling, 
epithelial-mesenchymal transformation, downregulation of apoptosis, protein 
folding defects, and complement pathway. The vitreo-retinal milieu in macular 
holes contain molecules related to both ECM degradation and inhibition of the 
same, thereby maintaining a homeostasis.

Differential phosphoproteome analysis of rat brain regions after 
organophosphorus compound sarin intoxication.

Chaubey K(1)(2), Alam SI(1), Waghmare CK(1), Bhattacharya BK(1).

INTRODUCTION: Sarin is a highly toxic organophosphorus nerve agent that 
irreversibly inhibits neuronal enzyme acetylcholinesterase. In the prevailing 
scenario, it is of paramount importance to develop early diagnosis and medical 
countermeasures for sarin exposure. A deeper understanding of the molecular 
mechanism of sarin intoxication and perturbations in the associated cellular 
processes is likely to provide valuable clues for the elucidation of diagnostic 
markers and therapeutic targets for sarin exposure.
METHODS: Present study, uncovered the changes in phosphorylation patterns of 
multiple proteins in different rat brain regions after sarin intoxication using 
2-DE/MS approach. It provided a holistic view of the phosphorylation-mediated 
changes in the cellular proteome and highlighted various signaling and response 
pathways affected at an early time point of sarin intoxication.
RESULTS: We found total 22 proteins in the cortex, 25 proteins in the corpus 
striatum, and 17 proteins in the hippocampus, showed ≥1.5 fold changes (hyper- 
or hypo- phosphorylated) with respect to control, either at 2.5 h or 1 d after 
sarin exposure. These results indicated the differential expression of 
phosphoproteins involved in protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum, carbon 
metabolism, metabolic function, and energy metabolism.
CONCLUSION: Four candidates (protein disulfide-isomerase A3, heat shock cognate 
71 kDa protein, alpha-enolase, and creatine kinase B-type), hyperphosphorylated 
in all three brain regions, can be further studied to understand the molecular 
mechanism behind neurodegenerative changes mediated by sarin exposure. The study 
sheds light on major pathogenic processes initiated during sarin intoxication 
and provides putative diagnostic markers/therapeutic targets for further 
validation.

Korean Ginseng Berry Polysaccharide Enhances Immunomodulation Activities of 
Peritoneal Macrophages in Mice with Cyclophosphamide-Induced Immunosuppression.

Choi J(1)(2), Nam JH(1), Rod-In W(2), Monmai C(2), Jang AY(1)(2), You S(1)(2), 
Park WJ(1)(2).

Korean ginseng (Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer), a member of the Araliaceae family, 
is known as a traditional medicine plant to have a wide range of health 
properties. Polysaccharides constitute a major component of Korean ginseng, and 
its berries exhibit immune modulating properties. The purpose of this study was 
to investigate the immune effects of crude polysaccharide (GBPC) extracted from 
Korean ginseng berry on peritoneal macrophages in mice with cyclophosphamide 
(CY)- induced immunosuppression. BALB/c mice were divided into eight groups: 
normal control, normal control + CY, levamisole + CY, ginseng + CY, and four 
concentrations of 50, 100, 250, and 500 mg/kg BW/day of GBPC + CY. Mice were 
orally administered with samples for 10 days. Immunosuppression was established 
by treating mice with CY (80 mg/kg BW/day) through intraperitoneal injection on 
days 4 to 6. The immune function of peritoneal macrophages was then evaluated. 
Oral administration of 500 mg/kg BW/day GBPC resulted in proliferation, NO 
production, and phagocytosis at 100%, 88%, and 91%, respectively, close to the 
levels of the normal group (100%) of peritoneal macrophages. In CY-treated mice, 
GBPC of 50-500 mg/kg BW/day also dose-dependently stimulated the proliferation, 
NO production, and phagocytosis at 56-100%, 47-88%, and 53-91%, respectively, 
with expression levels of immune-associated genes, such as iNOS, COX-2, IL-1β, 
IL-6, and TNF-α, of about 0.32 to 2.87-fold, compared to those in the CY group. 
GBPC could be a potential immunomodulatory material to control peritoneal 
macrophages under an immunosuppressive condition.

Polyoxidovanadates as a pharmacological option against brain aging.

Díaz A(1), Vázquez-Roque R(2), Carreto-Meneses K(3), Moroni-González D(3), 
Moreno-Rodríguez JA(3), Treviño S(4).

The world population is aging rapidly, and chronic diseases associated are 
cardiometabolic syndrome, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. Oxidative 
stress and inflammation are typical hallmarks in them. Polyoxidovanadates (POVs) 
have shown interesting pharmacological actions against chronic diseases. This 
work aimed to evaluate the POV effect on hippocampal neuroinflammation, redox 
balance, and recognition memory in the aging of rats. Rats 18 months old were 
administered a daily dose of sodium metavanadate (MV), decavanadate (DV), 
Metformin (Metf), or MetfDeca for two months. Results showed that short-term and 
long-term recognition memory improved by 28 % and 16 % (DV), 19 % and 20 % 
(Metf), and 21 % and 27 % (MetfDeca). In hippocampi, reactive oxygen species, 
IL-1β, and TNF-α, after DV, Metf, and MetfDeca decreased at similar 
concentrations to young adult control, while lipid peroxidation substantially 
ameliorated. Additionally, superoxide dismutase and catalase activity increased 
by 41 % and 42 % (DV), 39 % and 41 % (Metf), and 75 % and 73 % (MetfDeca). POV 
treatments reduced Nrf2 and GFAP immunoreactivity in CA1 (70-87.5 %), CA3 (60-80 
%), and DG (57-89 %). Metformin treatment showed a minor effect, while MV 
treatment did not improve any parameters. Although DV, Metf, and MetfDeca 
treatments showed similar results, POVs doses were 16-fold fewer than Metformin. 
In conclusion, DV and MetfDeca could be pharmacological options to reduce 
age-related neuronal damage.

Boosting Charge Transfer Efficiency by Nanofragment MXene for Efficient 
Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting of NiFe(OH)(x) Co-Catalyzed Hematite.

Park J(1), Yoon KY(1), Kwak MJ(1), Kang J(1), Kim S(1), Chaule S(1), Ha SJ(1), 
Jang JH(1).

The use of oxygen evolution co-catalysts (OECs) with hematite photoanodes has 
received much attention because of the potential to reduce surface charge 
recombination. However, the low surface charge transfer and bulk charge 
separation rate of hematite are not improved by decorating with OECs, and the 
intrinsic drawbacks of hematite still limit efficient photoelectrochemical (PEC) 
water splitting. Here, we successfully overcame the sluggish oxygen evolution 
reaction performance of hematite for water splitting by inserting 
zero-dimensional (0D) nanofragmented MXene (NFMX) as a hole transport material 
between the hematite and the OEC. The 0D NFMX was fabricated from 
two-dimensional (2D) MXene sheets and deposited onto the surface of a 
three-dimensional (3D) hematite photoanode via a centrifuge-assisted method 
without altering the inherent performance of the 2D MXene sheets. Among many 
OECs, NiFe(OH)x was selected as the OEC to improve hematite PEC performance in 
our system because of its efficient charge transport behavior and high 
stability. Because of the great synergy between NFMX and NiFe(OH)x, 
NiFe(OH)x/NFMX/Fe2O3 achieved a maximum photocurrent density of 3.09 mA cm-2 at 
1.23 VRHE, which is 2.78-fold higher than that of α-Fe2O3 (1.11 mA cm-2). 
Furthermore, the poor stability of MXene in an aqueous solution for water 
splitting was resolved by uniformly coating it with NiFe(OH)x, after which it 
showed outstanding stability for 60 h at 1.23 VRHE. This study demonstrates the 
successful use of NFMX as a hole transport material combined with an OEC for 
highly efficient water splitting.

Efficient Delivery of Globotriaosylceramide Synthase siRNA using 
Polyhistidine-Incorporated Lipid Nanoparticles.

Kim IG(1), Jung WH(1), You G(1), Lee H(2), Shin YJ(3), Lim SW(3), Chung 
BH(3)(4), Mok H(1).

In this study, a novel polyhistidine-incorporated lipid nanoparticle (pHis/LNP) 
is developed for the delivery of therapeutic globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) 
synthase siRNAs using a microfluidic device with pHis as a biocompatible method 
of endosome escape. To inhibit the expression of Gb3 synthase, six siRNAs 
against Gb3 synthase are designed and an optimal siRNA sequence is selected. 
Selected Gb3 synthase siRNA is incorporated into pHis/LNP to prepare a spherical 
siRNA pHis/LNP with a size of 62.5 ± 1.9 nm and surface charge of -13.3 ± 
4.2 mV. The pHis/LNP successfully protects siRNAs from degradation in 50% serum 
condition for 72 h. Prepared pHis/LNP exhibits superior stability for 20 days 
and excellent biocompatibility for A549 cells. After treatment with 
fluorescence-labeled LNPs, dotted fluorescent signals are co-localized with 
Lysotracker in cells with LNPs, whereas strong and diffused fluorescence 
intensity is observed in cells with pHis/LNPs probably due to successful 
endosomal escape. The extent of Gb3 synthase gene silencing by siRNA pHis/LNP is 
greatly improved (6.0-fold) compared to that by siRNA/LNP. Taken together, 
considering that the fabricated siRNA pHis/LNP exhibits excellent 
biocompatibility and superior gene silencing activity over conventional LNP, 
these particles can be utilized for the delivery of a wide range of therapeutic 
siRNAs.

An enhanced electron transport chain improved astaxanthin production in Phaffia 
rhodozyma.

Luna-Flores CH(1), Wang A(2), Cui Z(1)(3), von Hellens J(2), Speight RE(1)(3).

Astaxanthin (AX) is a carotenoid pigment with antioxidant properties widely used 
as a feed supplement. Wild-type strains of Phaffia rhodozyma naturally produce 
low AX yields, but we increased AX yields 50-fold in previous research using 
random mutagenesis of P. rhodozyma CBS6938 and fermentation optimization. On 
that study, genome changes were linked with phenotype, but relevant metabolic 
changes were not resolved. In this study, the wild-type and the superior P. 
rhodozyma mutant strains were grown in chemically defined media and instrumented 
fermenters. Differential kinetic, metabolomics, and transcriptomics data were 
collected. Our results suggest that carotenoid production was mainly associated 
with cell growth and had a positive regulation of central carbon metabolism 
metabolites, amino acids, and fatty acids. In the stationary phase, amino acids 
associated with the TCA cycle increased, but most of the fatty acids and central 
carbon metabolism metabolites decreased. TCA cycle metabolites were in abundance 
and media supplementation of citrate, malate, α-ketoglutarate, succinate, or 
fumarate increased AX production in the mutant strain. Transcriptomic data 
correlated with the metabolic and genomic data and found a positive regulation 
of genes associated with the electron transport chain suggesting this to be the 
main driver for improved AX production in the mutant strain.

Structural insights into the activity regulation of full-length non-structural 
protein 1 from SARS-CoV-2.

Wang Y(1), Kirkpatrick J(2), Lage SZ(3), Carlomagno T(4).

Comment in
    Structure. 2023 Feb 2;31(2):121-122.

Non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a major virulence factor and thus an attractive drug target. 
The last 33 amino acids of Nsp1 have been shown to bind within the mRNA entry 
tunnel of the 40S ribosomal subunit, shutting off host gene expression. Here, we 
report the solution-state structure of full-length Nsp1, which features an α/β 
fold formed by a six-stranded, capped β-barrel-like globular domain (N-terminal 
domain [NTD]), flanked by short N-terminal and long C-terminal flexible tails. 
The NTD has been found to be critical for 40S-mediated viral mRNA recognition 
and promotion of viral gene expression. We find that in free Nsp1, the NTD 
mRNA-binding surface is occluded by interactions with the acidic C-terminal 
tail, suggesting a mechanism of activity regulation based on the interplay 
between the folded NTD and the disordered C-terminal region. These results are 
relevant for drug-design efforts targeting Nsp1.

Thymoquinone-rich black cumin oil attenuates ibotenic acid-induced 
excitotoxicity through glutamate receptors in Wistar rats.

Inflammation-mediated alterations in glutamate neurotransmission constitute the 
most important pathway in the pathophysiology of various brain disorders. The 
excessive signalling of glutamate results in excitotoxicity, neuronal 
degeneration, and neuronal cell death. In the present study, we investigated the 
relative efficacy of black cumin (Nigella sativa) oil with high (5 % w/w) and 
low (2 % w/w) thymoquinone content (BCO-5 and BCO-2, respectively) in 
alleviating ibotenic acid-induced excitotoxicity and neuroinflammation in Wistar 
rats. It was found that BCO-5 reversed the abnormal behavioural patterns and the 
key inflammatory mediators (TNF-α and NF-κB) when treated at 5 mg/kg body 
weight. Immunohistochemical studies showed the potential of BCO-5 to attenuate 
the glutamate receptor subunits NMDA and GluR-2 along with increased glutamate 
decarboxylase levels in the brain tissues. Histopathological studies revealed 
the neuroprotection of BCO-5 against the inflammatory lesions, as evidenced by 
the normal cerebellum, astrocytes, and glial cells. BCO-2 on the other hand 
showed either a poor protective effect or no effect even at a 4-fold higher 
concentration of 20 mg/kg body weight indicating a very significant role of 
thymoquinone content on the neuroprotective effect of black cumin oil and its 
plausible clinical efficacy in counteracting the anxiety and stress-related 
neurological disorders under conditions such as depression and Alzheimer's 
disease.

Conformational ensemble of amyloid-forming semenogelin 1 peptide SEM1(68-107) by 
NMR spectroscopy and MD simulations.

Sanchugova D(1), Kusova A(2), Bikmullin A(1), Yulmetov A(1), Mukhametzyanov 
T(1), Klochkov V(1), Blokhin D(3).

SEM1(68-107) is a peptide corresponding to the region of semenogelin 1 protein 
from 68 to 107 amino acid position. SEM1(68-107) is an abundant component of 
semen, which participates in HIV infection enhanced by amyloid fibrils forming. 
To understand the causes influencing amyloid fibril formation, it is necessary 
to determine the spatial structure of SEM1(68-107). It was shown that the 
determination of SEM1(68-107) structure is complicated by the non-informative 
NMR spectra due to the high intramolecular mobility of peptides. The 
complementary approach based on the geometric restrictions of individual peptide 
fragments and molecular modeling was used for the determination of the spatial 
structure of SEM1(68-107). The N- (SEM1(68-85)) and C-terminuses (SEM1(86-107)) 
of SEM1(68-107) were chosen as two individual peptide fragments. SEM1(68-85) and 
SEM1(86-107) structures were established with NMR and circular dichroism CD 
spectroscopies. These regions were used as geometric restraints for the 
SEM1(68-107) structure modeling. Even though most of the SEM1(68-107) peptide is 
unstructured, our detailed analysis revealed the following structured elements: 
N-terminus (70His-84Gln) forms an α-helix, (86Asp-94Thr) and (101Gly-103Ser) 
regions fold into 310-helixes. The absence of a SEM1(68-107) rigid conformation 
leads to instability of these secondary structure regions. The calculated 
SEM1(68-107) structure is in good agreement with experimental values of 
hydrodynamic radius and dihedral angles obtained by NMR spectroscopy. This 
testifies the adequacy of a combined approach based on the use of peptide 
fragment structures for the molecular modeling formation of full-size peptide 
spatial structure.

Thermodynamic stabilization of von Willebrand factor A1 domain induces protein 
loss of function.

Sandoval-Pérez A(1), Mejía-Restrepo V, Aponte-Santamaría C.

The von Willebrand disease (vWD) is the most common hereditary bleeding disorder 
caused by defects of the von Willebrand Factor (vWF), a large extracellular 
protein in charge of adhering platelets to sites of vascular lesions. vWF 
performs this essential homeostatic task via specific protein-protein 
interactions between the vWF A1 domain and the platelet receptor, the 
glycoprotein Ib alpha (GPIBα). The two naturally occurring vWF A1 domain 
mutations G1324A and G1324S, near the GPIBα binding site, induce a dramatic 
decrease in platelet adhesion, resulting in a bleeding disorder classified as 
type 2M vWD. However, the reason for the drastic phenotypic response induced by 
these two supposedly minor modifications remains unclear. We addressed this 
question using a combination of equilibrium-molecular dynamics (MD) and 
nonequilibrium MD-based free energy simulations. Our data confirms that both 
mutations maintain the highly stable Rossmann fold of the vWF A1 domain. G1324A 
and G1324S mutations hardly changed the per-residue flexibility of the A1 domain 
but induced a global conformational change affecting the region near the binding 
site to GPIBα. Furthermore, we observed two significant changes in the vWF A1 
domain upon mutation, the global redistribution of the internal mechanical 
stress and the increased thermodynamic stability of the A1 domain. These 
observations are consistent with previously reported mutations increasing the 
melting temperature. Overall, our results support the idea of thermodynamic 
conformational restriction of A1-before the binding to GPIBα-as a crucial factor 
determining the loss-of-function of the G1324A(S) vWD mutants.

SARS-CoV-2 infection of host cells starts by binding the Spike glycoprotein 
(S) to the ACE2 receptor. The S-ACE2 interaction is a potential target for 
therapies against COVID-19 as demonstrated by the development of immunotherapies 
blocking this interaction. VE607 - a commercially available compound composed of 
three stereoisomers - was described as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-1. Here, we show 
that VE607 broadly inhibits pseudoviral particles bearing the Spike from major 
VOCs (D614G, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Omicron - BA.1, and BA.2) as well as 
authentic SARS-CoV-2 at low micromolar concentrations. In silico docking, 
mutational analysis, and smFRET revealed that VE607 binds to the receptor 
binding domain (RBD)-ACE2 interface and stabilizes RBD in its "up" conformation. 
Prophylactic treatment with VE607 did not prevent SARS-CoV-2-induced mortality 
in K18-hACE2 mice, but it did reduce viral replication in the lungs by 37-fold. 
Thus, VE607 is an interesting lead for drug development for the treatment of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Activin A specifically suppresses the expression of annexin A5 mRNA and augments 
gonadotropin-releasing hormone stimulation of A1 expression in LβT2 gonadotrope 
cells.

Murata T(1), Chiba S(1), Kawaminami M(1).

Recently, we reported that gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulates 
annexin A1 (Anxa1) and A5 (Anxa5) mRNA expression through the 
GnRH-receptor-mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade in LβT2 cells. As LβT2 
cells respond to activin, we examined the effect of activin A on Anxa1 and a5 
expression in LβT2 cells. Activin A (0.4 and 4 ng/mL) treatment decreased Anxa5 
mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner, but did not affect Anxa1 mRNA levels at 
concentrations up to 40 ng/mL. After activin A treatment (4 ng/mL), Anxa5 mRNA 
levels significantly decreased at 6 h, gradually declined until 24 h, and 
remained low until 48 h, whereas Anxa1 mRNA levels did not significantly change 
following treatment. Pretreatment with activin A for 24 h increased GnRH agonist 
(GnRHa)-induced Anxa1 increase by approximately 7-fold compared with GnRHa 
stimulation alone, but Anxa5 was not affected. As previously reported, these 
activin A treatments increased gonadotropin β subunit and GnRH receptor mRNA 
levels and slightly decreased common α-glycoprotein subunit mRNA levels. 
Furthermore, we examined the effect of activin A on Nr4a3, which is repressed by 
ANXA5 and which reduces Fshb expression, and found that activin A augmented 
Nr4a3 expression and slightly decreased the GnRHa-induced increase in Nr4a3. 
These results suggest that in gonadotrope cells, the mechanism regulating Anxa1 
and a5 expression is differentially coupled with activin A signal transduction. 
Activin A suppresses Anxa5 expression under increased Nr4a3 expression, whereas 
activin A and GnRH synergistically stimulate Anxa1 expression. These 
GnRH-inducible annexins may have different specific functions in gonadotropes.

Identification of potent inhibitors against chorismate synthase of Toxoplasma 
gondii using molecular dynamics simulations.

Singh S(1), Qureshi IA(2).

Toxoplasmosis, caused by Toxoplasma gondii, affects about 20-30% of the human 
population every year globally. The emergence of severe side effects of current 
chemotherapeutics and drug-resistant strains emphasize upon finding new 
therapeutics to treat toxoplasmosis. Chorismate synthase (CS) is a vital enzyme 
of shikimate pathway and responsible for formation of chorismate, which acts as 
a precursor for production of several aromatic compounds important for virulence 
and survival in many bacteria and protozoans. In this study, comparative 
modeling was employed to predict the three-dimensional structure of T. gondii 
chorismate synthase (TgCS) followed by its refinement and validation using 
various computational tools. The modeled structure of TgCS monomer shows all the 
conserved features of CS, particularly the beta-alpha-beta sandwich fold. 
Molecular docking studies has displayed that 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate 
(EPSP, substrate) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN, cofactor) bind into the active 
site of TgCS and all the structures (apo, binary, and ternary) were observed to 
be stable during molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Subsequently, 
structure-based virtual screening using TgCS has inferred two of each benzofuran 
and EPSP analogs as the best hits on the basis of RCS, molecular interactions, 
ADME properties, and MD simulations. The MD data of resultant protein-ligand 
complex structures was subjected to calculate the binding energy through MMPBSA 
method, which highlights that the EPSP analogs have higher binding affinity for 
the substrate-binding site of TgCS in comparison to benzofuran derivatives as 
well as substrate. Altogether, our study could pave the way for designing and 
development of next generation chemotherapeutic molecules against toxoplasmosis.

Nitrite Reductase Activity of Ferrous Nitrobindins: A Comparative Study.

De Simone G(1), di Masi A(1), Tundo GR(2), Coletta M(3), Ascenzi P(4).

Nitrobindins (Nbs) are all-β-barrel heme proteins spanning from bacteria to Homo 
sapiens. They inactivate reactive nitrogen species by sequestering NO, 
converting NO to HNO2, and promoting peroxynitrite isomerization to NO3-. Here, 
the nitrite reductase activity of Nb(II) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
(Mt-Nb(II)), Arabidopsis thaliana (At-Nb(II)), Danio rerio (Dr-Nb(II)), and Homo 
sapiens (Hs-Nb(II)) is reported. This activity is crucial for the in vivo 
production of NO, and thus for the regulation of blood pressure, being of the 
utmost importance for the blood supply to poorly oxygenated tissues, such as the 
eye retina. At pH 7.3 and 20.0 °C, the values of the second-order rate constants 
(i.e., kon) for the reduction of NO2- to NO and the concomitant formation of 
nitrosylated Mt-Nb(II), At-Nb(II), Dr-Nb(II), and Hs-Nb(II) (Nb(II)-NO) were 7.6 
M-1 s-1, 9.3 M-1 s-1, 1.4 × 101 M-1 s-1, and 5.8 M-1 s-1, respectively. The 
values of kon increased linearly with decreasing pH, thus indicating that the 
NO2--based conversion of Nb(II) to Nb(II)-NO requires the involvement of one 
proton. These results represent the first evidence for the NO2 reductase 
activity of Nbs(II), strongly supporting the view that Nbs are involved in NO 
metabolism. Interestingly, the nitrite reductase reactivity of all-β-barrel Nbs 
and of all-α-helical globins (e.g., myoglobin) was very similar despite the very 
different three-dimensional fold; however, differences between all-α-helical 
globins and all-β-barrel Nbs suggest that nitrite reductase activity appears to 
be controlled by distal steric barriers, even though a more complex regulatory 
mechanism can be also envisaged.

Antimicrobial potential of myricetin-coated zinc oxide nanocomposite against 
drug-resistant Clostridium perfringens.

Gomaa NH(1), El-Aziz NKA(2), El-Naenaeey EY(1), Abdelaziz WS(3), Sewid AH(1).

BACKGROUND: Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens) is an important pathogen in 
livestock animals and humans causing a wide array of systemic and enteric 
diseases. The current study was performed to investigate the inhibitory activity 
of myricetin (MYR), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and zinc oxide (ZnO) nanocomposite 
against growth and α-hemolysin of C. perfringens isolated from beef meat and 
chicken sources.
RESULTS: The overall occurrence of C. perfringens was 29.8%. The prevalence of 
C. perfringens was higher in chicken (38.3%) than in beef meat products (10%). 
The antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that C. perfringens isolates 
exhibited high resistance levels for metronidazole (93%), bacitracin (89%), 
penicillin G (84%), and lincomycin (76%). Of note, 1% of C. perfringens isolates 
were pandrug-resistant (PDR), 4% were extensive drug-resistant (XDR), while 91% 
were multidrug-resistant. The results of broth microdilution technique revealed 
that all tested C. perfringens isolates were susceptible to MYR-loaded ZnO/PVA 
with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranged from 0.125 to 2 µg/mL. 
Moreover, the MYR either alone or combined with the nanocomposite had no 
cytotoxic activities on chicken red blood cells (cRBCs). Transcriptional 
modifications of MYR, ZnO, ZnO/PVA, and ZnO/PVA/MYR nanocomposite were 
determined, and the results showed significant down-regulation of α-hemolysin 
fold change to 0.5, 0.7, 0.6, and 0.28, respectively compared to the untreated 
bacteria.
CONCLUSION: This is an in vitro study reporting the antimicrobial potential of 
MYR-coated ZnO nanocomposite as an effective therapeutic candidate against C. 
perfringens. An in vivo approach is the next step to provide evidence for 
applying these alternatives in the treatment and prevention of C. 
perfringens-associated diseases.

The NeuroinflammatoryPotential of HIV-1 NefVariants in Modulating the Gene 
Expression Profile of Astrocytes.

Jadhav S(1)(2), Makar P(3), Nema V(1).

HIV-1 mediated neurotoxicity is thought to be associated with HIV-1 viral 
proteins activating astrocytes and microglia by inducing inflammatory cytokines 
leading to the development of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). In 
the current study, we observe how HIV-1 Nef upregulates the levels of IL-6, 
IP-10, and TNF-α around 6.0fold in normal human astrocytes (NHAs) compared to 
cell and empty vector controls. Moderate downregulation in the expression 
profile of inflammatory cytokines was observed due to RNA interference. 
Furthermore, we determine the impact of inflammatory cytokines in the 
upregulation of kynurenine pathway metabolites, such as indoleamine 
2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid oxygenase (HAAO) in NHA, 
and found the same to be 3.0- and 3.2-fold, respectively. Additionally, the 
variation in the level of nitric oxide before and after RNA interference was 
significant. The upregulated cytokines and pathway-specific metabolites could be 
linked with the neurotoxic potential of HIV-1 Nef. Thus, the downregulation in 
cytokines and kynurenine metabolites observed after siRNA-Nef interference 
indicates the possibility of combining the RNA interference approach with 
current antiretroviral therapy to prevent neurotoxicity development.

Biomimetic anti-inflammatory and osteogenic nanoparticles self-assembled with 
mineral ions and tannic acid for tissue engineering.

Byun H(#)(1)(2), Jang GN(#)(1)(2), Hong MH(3), Yeo J(4), Shin H(5), Kim WJ(4), 
Shin H(6)(7)(8).

Bone healing involves complex processes including inflammation, induction, and 
remodeling. In this context, anti-inflammatory and osteoconductive 
multi-functional nanoparticles have attracted considerable attention for 
application in improved bone tissue regeneration. In particular, nanoparticles 
that promote suppression of inflammatory response after injury and direction of 
desirable tissue regeneration events are of immense interest to researchers. We 
herein report a one-step method to prepare multi-functional nanoparticles using 
tannic acid (TA) and simulated body fluid (SBF) containing multiple mineral 
ions. Mineral-tannic acid nanoparticles (mTNs) were rapidly fabricated in 
10 min, and their size (around 250-350 nm) and chemical composition were 
controlled through the TA concentration. In vitro analysis using human adipose 
derived stem cells (hADSCs) showed that mTNs effectively scavenged reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) and enhanced osteogenesis of hADSCs by inducing secretion 
of alkaline phosphatase. mTNs also increased osteogenic marker gene expression 
even in the presence of ROS, which can generally arrest osteogenesis (OPN: 1.74, 
RUNX2: 1.90, OCN: 1.47-fold changes relative to cells not treated with mTNs). In 
vivo analysis using a mouse peritonitis model revealed that mTNs showed 
anti-inflammatory effects by decreasing levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in 
blood (IL-6: 73 ± 4, TNF-α: 42 ± 2%) and peritoneal fluid (IL-6: 78 ± 2, TNF-α: 
21 ± 6%). We believe that this one-step method for fabrication of 
multi-functional nanoparticles has considerable potential in tissue engineering 
approaches that require control of complex microenvironments, as required for 
tissue regeneration.

STEMIN and YAP5SA synthetic modified mRNAs regenerate and repair infarcted mouse 
hearts.

Xiao S(1), Liang R(1), Lucero E(2), McConnell BK(2), Chen Z(3), Chang J(3), 
Navran S(4), Schwartz RJ(1), Iyer D(1).

INTRODUCTION: The adult heart lacks the regenerative capacity to self-repair. 
Serum response factor (SRF) is essential for heart organogenesis, 
sarcomerogenesis, and contractility. SRF interacts with co-factors, such as 
NKX2.5 and GATA4, required for cardiac specified gene activity. ETS factors such 
as ELK1 interact with SRF and drive cell replication. To weaken SRF interactions 
with NKX2.5 and GATA4, one mutant, SRF153(A3) named STEMIN, did not bind CArG 
boxes, yet induced stem cell factors such as NANOG and OCT4, cardiomyocyte 
dedifferentiation, and cell cycle reentry. The mutant YAP5SA of the Hippo 
pathway also promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation and growth.
AIM: Infarcted adult mouse hearts were injected with translatable STEMIN and 
YAP5SA mmRNA to evaluate their clinical potential.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Mice were pulsed one day later with alpha-EDU and then 
heart sections were DAPI stained. Replicating cells were identified by 
immuno-staining against members of the DNA replisome pathway that mark entry to 
S phase of the cell cycle. Echocardiography was used to determine cardiac 
function following infarcts and mRNA treatment. To monitor cardiac wall repair, 
microscopic analysis was performed, and the extent of myocardial fibrosis was 
analyzed for immune cell infiltration. Injections of STEMIN and YAP5SA mmRNA 
into the left ventricles of infarcted adult mice promoted a greater than 17-fold 
increase in the DAPI stained and alpha-EDU marked cardiomyocyte nuclei, within a 
day. We observed de novo expression of phospho-histone H3, ORC2, MCM2, and 
CLASPIN. Cardiac function was significantly improved by four weeks post-infarct, 
and fibrosis and immune cell infiltration were diminished in hearts treated with 
STEMIN and YAP5SA mmRNA than each alone.
CONCLUSION: STEMIN and YAP5SA mmRNA improved cardiac function and myocardial 
fibrosis in left ventricles of infarcted adult mice. The combinatorial use of 
mmRNA encoding STEMIN and YAP5SA has the potential to become a powerful clinical 
strategy to treat human heart disease.

Conversion of the Native N-Terminal Domain of TDP-43 into a Monomeric 
Alternative Fold with Lower Aggregation Propensity.

Moretti M(1), Marzi I(1), Cantarutti C(2), Vivoli Vega M(3), Mandaliti W(2), 
Mimmi MC(4), Bemporad F(1), Corazza A(2)(5), Chiti F(1).

TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) forms intraneuronal cytoplasmic inclusions 
associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and ubiquitin-positive 
frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Its N-terminal domain (NTD) can 
dimerise/oligomerise with the head-to-tail arrangement, which is essential for 
function but also favours liquid-liquid phase separation and inclusion formation 
of full-length TDP-43. Using various biophysical approaches, we identified an 
alternative conformational state of NTD in the presence of Sulfobetaine 3-10 
(SB3-10), with higher content of α-helical structure and tryptophan solvent 
exposure. NMR shows a highly mobile structure, with partially folded regions and 
β-sheet content decrease, with a concomitant increase of α-helical structure. It 
is monomeric and reverts to native oligomeric NTD upon SB3-10 dilution. The 
equilibrium GdnHCl-induced denaturation shows a cooperative folding and a 
somewhat lower conformational stability. When the aggregation processes were 
compared with and without pre-incubation with SB3-10, but at the identical final 
SB3-10 concentration, a slower aggregation was found in the former case, despite 
the reversible attainment of the native conformation in both cases. This was 
attributed to protein monomerization and oligomeric seeds disruption by the 
conditions promoting the alternative conformation. Overall, the results show a 
high plasticity of TDP-43 NTD and identify strategies to monomerise TDP-43 NTD 
for methodological and biomedical applications.

Effectiveness of Booster Doses of the SARS-CoV-2 Inactivated Vaccine KCONVAC 
against the Mutant Strains.

Xiao C(1), Su J(2), Zhang C(1)(3), Huang B(4), Mao L(4), Ren Z(4), Bai W(5), Li 
H(6), Lei G(6), Zheng J(6), Chen G(1), Liang X(1)(7), Qiu C(1)(7).

As the COVID-19 epidemic progresses with the emergence of different SARS-CoV-2 
variants, it is important to know the effectiveness of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 
vaccines against the variants. To maximize efficiency, a third boost injection 
of the high-dose SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine KCONVAC was selected for 
investigation. In addition to the ancestral strain, KCONVAC boost vaccination 
induced neutralizing antibodies and antigen-specific CD8 T cells to recognize 
several variants, including B.1.617.2 (Delta), B.1.1.529 (Omicron), B.1.1.7 
(Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P.3, B.1.526.1 (Lota), B.1.526.2, B.1.618, and 
B.1.617.3. Both humoral and cellular immunity against variants were lower than 
those of ancestral variants but continued to increase from day 0 to day 7 to day 
50 after boost vaccination. Fifty days post-boost, the KCONVAC-vaccinated CD8 
T-cell level reached 1.23-, 2.59-, 2.53-, and 1.01-fold that of convalescents 
against ancestral, Delta, Omicron and other SARS-CoV-2 variants, respectively. 
Our data demonstrate the importance of KCONVAC boosters to broaden both humoral 
and cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Analysis of Amino Acids in the Roots of Tamarix ramosissima by Application of 
Exogenous Potassium (K(+)) under NaCl Stress.

Chen Y(1)(2), Zhang S(2), Du S(1), Zhang X(3), Jiang J(1), Wang G(2).

Soil salinization is one of the main environmental factors affecting plant 
growth worldwide. Tamarix ramosissima Ledeb. (T. ramosissima) is a halophyte 
representative that is widely grown in salinized soils. As an important nutrient 
element for plant growth, K+ plays an important role in improving the tolerance 
to salt stress, but the mechanism of reducing the damage caused by NaCl stress 
to T. ramosissima is less reported. Our results show that the proline content 
and the Log2 fold-change of proline's relative quantification in the roots of T. 
ramosissima increased over time with the application of exogenous potassium (K+) 
for 48 h and 168 h under NaCl stress. Moreover, 13 amino-acid-related metabolic 
pathways were involved in the resistance of T. ramosissima to salt stress. 
Mainly, the aldehyde dehydrogenase family genes and tryptophan-synthase-related 
genes were found at 48 h and 168 h with exogenous potassium applied to the roots 
of T. ramosissima under NaCl stress, and they regulated their related metabolic 
accumulation in the arginine and proline metabolism pathways, increasing the 
effectiveness of inducing NaCl tolerance of T. ramosissima. It is noteworthy 
that alpha-ketobutyric was produced in the roots of T. ramosissima under NaCl 
stress for 48 h with the application of exogenous potassium, which is one of the 
most effective mechanisms for inducing salt tolerance in plants. Meanwhile, we 
found three DEGs regulating alpha-ketobutyric acid. This study provides a 
scientific theoretical basis for further understanding the molecular mechanism 
of K+ alleviating the salinity damage to T. ramosissima caused by NaCl.

The Long Non-coding RNA HOTAIR Controls the Self-renewal, Cell Senescence, and 
Secretion of Anti-aging Protein α-Klotho in Human Adult Renal Progenitor Cells.

Picerno A(1), Giannuzzi F(1), Curci C(2), De Palma G(3), Di Chiano M(4), Simone 
S(2), Franzin R(2)(5), Gallone A(4)(5), Di Lorenzo VF(6), Stasi A(2)(5), Pertosa 
GB(2)(5), Sabbà C(1), Gesualdo L(2)(5), Sallustio F(1)(5).

The long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) play an important role in several biological 
processes, including some renal diseases. Nevertheless, little is known about 
lncRNA that are expressed in the healthy kidneys and involved in renal cell 
homeostasis and development, and even less is known about lncRNA involved in the 
maintenance of human adult renal stem/progenitor cells (ARPCs) that have been 
shown to be very important for renal homeostasis and repair processes. Through a 
whole-genome transcriptome screening, we found that the HOTAIR lncRNA is highly 
expressed in renal progenitors and potentially involved in cell cycle and 
senescence biological processes. By CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, we generated 
HOTAIR knockout ARPC lines and established a key role of this lncRNA in ARPC 
self-renewal properties by sustaining their proliferative capacity and limiting 
the apoptotic process. Intriguingly, the HOTAIR knockout led to the ARPC 
senescence and to a significant decrease in the CD133 stem cell marker 
expression which is an inverse marker of ARPC senescence and can regulate renal 
tubular repair after the damage. Furthermore, we found that ARPCs expressed high 
levels of the α-Klotho anti-aging protein and especially 2.6-fold higher levels 
compared to that secreted by renal proximal tubular cells (RPTECs). Finally, we 
showed that HOTAIR exerts its function through the epigenetic silencing of the 
cell cycle inhibitor p15 inducing the trimethylation of the histone H3K27. 
Altogether, these results shed new light on the mechanisms of regulation of 
these important renal cells and may support the future development of precision 
therapies for kidney diseases.

R97 at "Handlebar" Binding Mode in Active Pocket Plays an Important Role in 
Fe(II)/α-Ketoglutaric Acid-Dependent Dioxygenase cis-P3H-Mediated Selective 
Synthesis of (2S,3R)-3-Hydroxypipecolic Acid.

Guan J(1), Lu Y(1), Dai Z(1), Zhao S(1), Xu Y(1)(2), Nie Y(1)(3).

Pipecolic acid (Pip) and its derivative hydroxypipecolic acids, such as 
(2S,3R)-3-hydroxypipecolic acid (cis-3-L-HyPip), are components of many natural 
and synthetic bioactive molecules. Fe(II)/α-ketoglutaric acid 
(Fe(II)/2-OG)-dependent dioxygenases can catalyze the hydroxylation of pipecolic 
acid. However, the available enzymes with desired activity and selectivity are 
limited. Herein, we compare the possible candidates in the Fe(II)/2-OG-dependent 
dioxygenase family, and cis-P3H is selected for potentially catalyzing selective 
hydroxylation of L-Pip. cis-P3H was further engineered to increase its catalytic 
efficiency toward L-Pip. By analyzing the structural confirmation and residue 
composition in substrate-binding pocket, a "handlebar" mode of molecular 
interactions is proposed. Using molecular docking, virtual mutation analysis, 
and dynamic simulations, R97, E112, L57, and G282 were identified as the key 
residues for subsequent site-directed saturation mutagenesis of cis-P3H. 
Consequently, the variant R97M showed an increased catalytic efficiency toward 
L-Pip. In this study, the kcat/Km value of the positive mutant R97M was about 
1.83-fold that of the wild type. The mutation R97M would break the salt bridge 
between R97 and L-Pip and weaken the positive-positive interaction between R97 
and R95. Therefore, the force on the amino and carboxyl groups of L-Pip was 
lightly balanced, allowing the molecule to be stabilized in the active pocket. 
These results provide a potential way of improving cis-P3H catalytic activity 
through rational protein engineering.

Attenuation of Palmitic Acid-Induced Intestinal Epithelial Barrier Dysfunction 
by 6-Shogaol in Caco-2 Cells: The Role of MiR-216a-5p/TLR4/NF-κB Axis.

Ouyang F(1), Li B(2), Wang Y(1), Xu L(1), Li D(1), Li F(1), Sun-Waterhouse D(3).

Palmitic acid (PA) can lead to intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction. In 
this study, the protective effects and working mechanisms of 6-shogaol against 
PA-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction were investigated in human intestinal 
epithelial Caco-2 cells. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), 
paracellular flux, qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence, and Western blot experiments 
showed that the 24-h treatment with 400 μM PA damaged intestinal barrier 
integrity, as evidenced by a reduction of 48% in the TEER value, a 4.1-fold 
increase in the flux of fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran 4000 (FD-4), and 
decreases in the mRNA and protein expression of tight junction (TJ)-associated 
proteins (claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1), compared with the control. The PA 
treatment significantly (p < 0.05) increased the levels of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines (interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)) 
in Caco-2 cells due to the upregulation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid 
differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), phosphorylated nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) 
proteins, and downregulation of miR-216a-5p (which directly targeted TLR4). 
Co-treatment with PA and 6-shogaol (2.5 μM) significantly (p < 0.05) attenuated 
PA-induced changes through regulation of TJs via the miR-216a-5p/TLR4/NF-κB 
signaling pathway. This study provides insights into the functions and working 
mechanisms of 6-shogaol as a promising food-derived agent against PA-induced 
intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction.

Structure-based optimization of Toddacoumalone as highly potent and selective 
PDE4 inhibitors with anti-inflammatory effects.

Zhou F(1), Huang Y(1), Liu L(1), Song Z(1), Hou KQ(1), Yang Y(1), Luo HB(2), 
Huang YY(3), Xiong XF(4).

Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) is an important drug target for inflammatory 
diseases. Previously, we identified a series of novel PDE4 inhibitors derived 
from the natural Toddacoumalone, among which the hit compound 2 with a 
naphthyridine scaffold showed moderate potency with the IC50 value of 400 nM. 
Based on the co-crystal structure of PDE4D-2, further structural optimizations 
and structure-activity relationship studies led to a highly potent PDE4 
inhibitor 23a with the IC50 value of 0.25 nM and excellent selectivity profiles 
over other PDEs (>4000-fold). The co-crystal structure of PDE4D-23a elucidated 
that 23a has strong interactions with the M and Q pocket of PDE4D. Importantly, 
compound 23a significantly inhibits the release of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α 
and IL-6 in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Thus, compound 23a 
with a naphthyridine scaffold is a promising PDE4 inhibitor for the treatment of 
inflammatory diseases.

To characterize the IgG and IgA responses to different SARS-CoV-2 proteins, we 
investigated the antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 following natural infection 
and following a single dose of AZD1222 (Covishield), in Sri Lankan individuals. 
The IgG and IgA responses were assessed to S1, S2, RBD, and N proteins in 
patients at 4 weeks and 12 weeks since the onset of illness or following 
vaccination. Antibodies to the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 wild type 
(WT), α, β, and λ and ACE2 (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2) receptor blocking 
antibodies were also assessed in these cohorts. For those with mild illness and 
in vaccines, the IgG responses to S1, S2, RBD, and N protein increased from 4 
weeks to 12 weeks, while it remained unchanged in those with moderate/severe 
illness. In the vaccines, IgG antibodies to the S2 subunit had the highest 
significant rise (P < 0.0001). Vaccines had several-fold lower IgA antibodies to 
all the SARS-CoV-2 proteins tested than those with natural infection. At 12 
weeks, the haemagglutination test (HAT) titres were significantly lower to the α 
in vaccines and significantly lower in those with mild illness and in vaccines 
to β and for λ. No such difference was seen in those with moderate/severe 
illness. Vaccines had significantly less IgA to SARS-CoV-2, but comparable IgG 
responses those with natural infection. However, following a single dose 
vaccines had reduced antibody levels to the VOCs, which further declined with 
time, suggesting the need to reduce the gap between the two doses, in countries 
experiencing outbreaks due to VOCs.

Estrogen is known to regulate bone metabolism in both women and men, but 
substantial gaps remain in our knowledge of estrogen and estrogen receptor alpha 
(ERα) regulation of adult bone metabolism. Studies using global ERα-knockout 
mice were confounded by high circulating sex-steroid levels, and 
osteocyte/osteoblast-specific ERα deletion may be confounded by ERα effects on 
growth versus the adult skeleton. Thus, we developed mice expressing the 
tamoxifen-inducible CreERT2 in osteocytes using the 8-kilobase (kb) Dmp1 
promoter (Dmp1CreERT2 ). These mice were crossed with ERαfl//fl mice to create 
ERαΔOcy mice, permitting inducible osteocyte-specific ERα deletion in adulthood. 
After intermittent tamoxifen treatment of adult 4-month-old mice for 1 month, 
female, but not male, ERαΔOcy mice exhibited reduced spine bone volume fraction 
(BV/TV (-20.1%, p = 0.004) accompanied by decreased trabecular bone formation 
rate (-18.9%, p = 0.0496) and serum P1NP levels (-38.9%, p = 0.014). Periosteal 
(+65.6%, p = 0.004) and endocortical (+64.1%, p = 0.003) expansion were higher 
in ERαΔOcy mice compared to control (Dmp1CreERT2 ) mice at the tibial diaphysis, 
reflecting the known effects of estrogen to inhibit periosteal apposition and 
promote endocortical formation. Increases in Sost (2.1-fold, p = 0.001) 
messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were observed in trabecular bone at the spine in 
ERαΔOcy mice, consistent with previous reports that estrogen deficiency is 
associated with increased circulating sclerostin as well as bone SOST mRNA 
levels in humans. Further, the biological consequences of increased Sost 
expression were reflected in significant overall downregulation in panels of 
osteoblast and Wnt target genes in osteocyte-enriched bones from ERαΔOcy mice. 
These findings thus establish that osteocytic ERα is critical for estrogen 
action in female, but not male, adult bone metabolism. Moreover, the reduction 
in bone formation accompanied by increased Sost, decreased osteoblast, and 
decreased Wnt target gene expression in ERαΔOcy mice provides a direct link in 
vivo between ERα and Wnt signaling. © 2022 American Society for Bone and Mineral

Effects of medical plants from Zingiberaceae family on cardiovascular risk 
factors of type 2 diabetes mellitus: A systematic review and meta-analysis of 
randomized controlled trials.

Zhang X(1), Chen X(1), Tang Y(1), Guan X(1), Deng J(1), Fan J(1).

We performed a meta-analysis on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate 
the efficacy of Zingiberaceae on cardiovascular risk factors in type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM). PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and 
Scopus were searched systematically until October 18, 2021. Thirty-four RCTs 
with 2154 patients met our inclusion. Pooled analysis indicated that 
Zingiberaceae can significantly improve body weight (BW) (WMD = -1.012, 95% CI: 
-1.673, -0.351, p = .003), fasting blood glucose (FBG) (WMD = -14.292, 95% CI: 
-18.588, -9.995, p < .001), glycosylated hemoglobin 1c (HbA1c) (WMD = -0.432, 
95% CI: -0.607, -0.257, p < .001), serum insulin (WMD = -2.036, 95% CI: -2.857, 
-1.216, p < .001), homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) 
(WMD = -0.886, 95% CI: -1.375, -0.398, p < .001), high density 
lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) (WMD = 0.850, 95% CI: 0.018, 1.682, p = .045), 
triglyceride (TG) (WMD = -17.636, 95% CI: -27.121, -8.151, p < .001), diastolic 
blood pressure (DBP) (WMD = -0.642, 95% CI: -1.148, -0.137, p = .013), 
C-reactive protein (CRP) (WMD = -0.623, 95% CI: -1.061, -0.186, p = .005), tumor 
necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (WMD = -3.020, 95% CI: -4.327, -1.712, p < .001), and 
interleukin 6 (IL-6) (WMD = -1.147, 95% CI: -1.887, -0.406, p = .002). The 
supplementation of Zingiberaceae may be an effective adjunctive therapy in 
management of T2DM and prevention cardiovascular complications by decreasing BW, 
improving blood glucose control, insulin resistance, lipid profiles (HDL-C and 
TG), blood pressure (DBP), and reducing inflammation (CRP, TNF-α, and IL-6). 
PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Approximately half of the deaths of individuals with 
diabetes mellitus (DM) are attributable to cardiovascular disease (CVD), and 
individuals with T2DM have a two-fold increased risk of cardiovascular mortality 
than healthy individuals. Currently, T2DM is mainly treated with hypoglycemic 
medication such as sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, meglitinides, and 
biguanides. Nevertheless, most of them with long-term usage could cause side 
effects, including hypoglycemia and gastrointestinal troubles. Several species 
of the Zingiberaceae family are used in traditional herbal medicines, which have 
been widely used in traditional and complementary medicine. Proving the 
potential benefits of Zingiberaceae on T2DM and its cardiovascular complications 
has positive clinical implications for the use of this practical herb.

An N-capping asparagine-lysine-proline (NKP) motif contributes to a hybrid 
flexible/stable multifunctional peptide scaffold.

Structural diversity drives multiple biological activities and mechanisms of 
action in linear peptides. Here we describe an unusual N-capping 
asparagine-lysine-proline (NKP) motif that confers a hybrid multifunctional 
scaffold to a computationally designed peptide (PaDBS1R7). PaDBS1R7 has a 
shorter α-helix segment than other computationally designed peptides of similar 
sequence but with key residue substitutions. Although this motif acts as an 
α-helix breaker in PaDBS1R7, the Asn5 presents exclusive N-capping effects, 
forming a belt to establish hydrogen bonds for an amphipathic α-helix 
stabilization. The combination of these different structural profiles was 
described as a coil/N-cap/α-helix scaffold, which was also observed in diverse 
computational peptide mutants. Biological studies revealed that all peptides 
displayed antibacterial activities. However, only PaDBS1R7 displayed anticancer 
properties, eradicated Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms, decreased bacterial 
counts by 100-1000-fold in vivo, reduced lipopolysaccharide-induced macrophages 
stress, and stimulated fibroblast migration for wound healing. This study 
extends our understanding of an N-capping NKP motif to engineering hybrid 
multifunctional peptide drug candidates with potent anti-infective and 
immunomodulatory properties.

OT(2)(4), Ilori BM(3), Wheto M(3).

Early age thermal conditioning has been found to improve thermotolerance in 
birds. This study assessed the effect of perinatal thermal conditioning on serum 
parameters, corticosterone, free fatty acid, globulin and expression of 
corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) gene in five chicken strains; using fifty 
chicks per strain of Cobb 500 (C500), Ross 308 (R308), Shika Brown (SB), Normal 
Feathered Nigeria Indigenous (NF) and FUNAAB Alpha (FA). Twenty-five chicks per 
strain were conditioned at 40 ± 1 °C for 3 h on day 6. On day 10, both 
conditioned and unconditioned chicks were challenged acutely at 40 ± 1 °C for 
15 min, without feed and water. Body weight and feed intake data were collected 
before and after the heat exposures. Blood samples were collected to determine 
serum electrolytes, metabolites and corticosterone levels. Brain tissue samples 
were collected from the 10-day-old conditioned and unconditioned chicks, from 
which RNA were extracted, synthesized into cDNA and subjected to qPCR. Serum 
parameters were significantly affected (p < 0.05) by strain, thermal 
conditioning and their interactions. Calcium and glucose concentrations were 
highest in NF while FA had highest in sodium. Calcium, glucose and phosphorus 
were higher in conditioned birds. NF had the highest free fatty acid while FA 
had the lowest. C500 had the highest globulin levels. Thermal conditioning 
significantly lowered corticosterone levels in conditioned birds. CRH was shown 
to be overexpressed in C500. From this research, it can be concluded that early 
age thermal conditioning affects body temperature regulation in chickens and 
enhances thermotolerance.

Randomized single oral dose phase 1 study of safety, tolerability, and 
pharmacokinetics of Iminosugar UV-4 Hydrochloride (UV-4B) in healthy subjects.

Evans DeWald L(2), Spurgers K(2), Warfield KL(2), Lowe P(2), Duchars M(2), 
Sampath A(2), Ramstedt U(3).

BACKGROUND: UV-4 (N-(9'-methoxynonyl)-1-deoxynojirimycin, also called MON-DNJ) 
is an iminosugar small-molecule oral drug candidate with in vitro antiviral 
activity against diverse viruses including dengue, influenza, and filoviruses 
and demonstrated in vivo efficacy against both dengue and influenza viruses. The 
antiviral mechanism of action of UV-4 is through inhibition of the host 
endoplasmic reticulum-resident α-glucosidase 1 and α-glucosidase 2 enzymes. This 
inhibition prevents proper glycan processing and folding of virus glycoproteins, 
thereby impacting virus assembly, secretion, and the fitness of nascent virions.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we report a first-in-human, single 
ascending dose Phase 1a study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and 
pharmacokinetics of UV-4 hydrochloride (UV-4B) in healthy subjects 
(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT02061358). Sixty-four subjects received single 
oral doses of UV-4 as the hydrochloride salt equivalent to 3, 10, 30, 90, 180, 
360, 720, or 1000 mg of UV-4 (6 subjects per cohort), or placebo (2 subjects per 
cohort). Single doses of UV-4 hydrochloride were well tolerated with no serious 
adverse events or dose-dependent increases in adverse events observed. Clinical 
laboratory results, vital signs, and physical examination data did not reveal 
any safety signals. Dose-limiting toxicity was not observed; the maximum 
tolerated dose of UV-4 hydrochloride in humans has not yet been determined 
(>1000 mg). UV-4 was rapidly absorbed and distributed after dosing with the oral 
solution formulation used in this study. Median time to reach maximum plasma 
concentration ranged from 0.5-1 hour and appeared to be independent of dose. 
Exposure increased approximately in proportion with dose over the 333-fold dose 
range. UV-4 was quantifiable in pooled urine over the entire collection interval 
for all doses.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: UV-4 is a host-targeted broad-spectrum antiviral drug 
candidate. At doses in humans up to 1000 mg there were no serious adverse events 
reported and no subjects were withdrawn from the study due to treatment-emergent 
adverse events. These data suggest that therapeutically relevant drug levels of 
UV-4 can be safely administered to humans and support further clinical 
development of UV-4 hydrochloride or other candidate antivirals in the 
iminosugar class.

Results of the study of mucosal immunity indices in patients with cancer of the 
oral cavity and oropharynx during radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy therapy and 
immunotherapy with α/β-defensins.

[Article in English]

Hirna HA, Maltsev DV, Rozhko MM, Kostyshyn ID.

BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to investigate the concentration of 
interferon (INF) -a, INF- g, interleukin (IL) -6, and secretory IgA (sIgA) in 
saliva during various regimens of antitumour treatment and immunotherapy (IT) 
with a/b-defensins in patients with cancer of the oral cavity and oropharynx in 
order to find ways to increase the effectiveness and improvement of the 
tolerability of antitumour treatment on the base of the identification of 
biomarkers for the evaluation of the antitumour effect and the prediction of 
complications.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have studied the changes in the immunity indices of 
105 patients who were diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity 
or oropharynx for the first time. The patients received radiotherapy (RT) or 
chemoradiotherapy and IT with a/b-defensins in different doses (40 and 60 mg) at 
the 1st phase of the special treatment.
RESULTS: A determined drop in the concentration of INF-a after cytostatic 
treatment, and the additional use of IT with a/b-defensins in different doses do 
not produce the protective effect on the production of INF-a. Regarding INF- g, 
a more than two-fold decrease in the concentration of INF- g in the saliva of 
patients in group receiving a double dose of an immunotherapeutic agent along 
with radiation therapy (RT) was noted, which may indicate an adjuvant effect of 
a/b-defensins in relation to RT, enhancing its antitumour influence, and thereby 
ensuring the regression of neoplasia. In case of an increased dose of 
a/b-defensins use during RT, there was found immunomodulatory effect in relation 
to IL-6. In the group of patients who received RT and a higher dose of the 
immune agent, the "scissors phenomenon" was noted - a simultaneous decrease in 
the concentration of INF- g and an increase in the concentration of sIgA in 
saliva, which, taking into account the reduced risk of mucositis and better 
regression of the tumour, shows the meaningful adjuvant and immunomodulating 
effects of a/b-defensin therapy in the study group.
CONCLUSION: High-dose IT with a/b-defensins against the background of cytostatic 
therapy in patients with cancer of the oral cavity and oropharynx potentially 
leads to an adjuvant and immunomodulatory effect with a decrease in the 
concentration of INF- g and a parallel increase in the concentration of sIgA in 
saliva, i.e., reconstruction of the immune response from Th1- to Th2-profile - 
the profile associated with the tumour regression. With the development of the 
radio-induced mucositis in these patients, a decrease in concentration of sIgA 
in saliva with a tendency to a progressive decrease of this index with the 
increase of mucositis severity was noted. The data obtained allow us to consider 
INF- g and sIgA as biomarkers of the effectiveness of traditional anticancer 
therapy during the use of a/b-defensins, and sIgA as a biomarker of the risk of 
developing radio-induced mucositis in patients with cancer of the oral cavity 
and oropharynx, which should be verified in further clinical studies with better 
design.

Irinotecan (CTP-11) is one of the standard therapies for colorectal cancer 
(CRC). CTP-11 is enzymatically converted to the hydrophobic 
7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN38), a one hundred-fold more active 
metabolite. Conjugation of hydrophobic anticancer drugs to nanomaterials is a 
strategy to improve their solubility, efficacy, and selectivity. Carbon dots 
(CDs) have garnered interest for their small sizes (<10 ​nm), low toxicity, high 
water solubility, and bright fluorescence. This paper describes the use of CDs 
to improve drug vehiculation, stability, and chemotherapeutic efficiency of SN38 
through a direct intracellular uptake in CRC. The covalent conjugation of SN38 
to CDs via a carbamate bond provides a CD-SN38 hybrid material for slow, 
sustained, and pH-responsive drug release. CD-SN38 successfully penetrates the 
CRC cells with a release in the nucleus affecting first the cell cycle and then 
the cytoskeleton. Moreover, CD-SN38 leads to a deregulation of the extracellular 
matrix (ECM), one of the major components of the cancer niche considered a 
possible target therapy for reducing the cancer progression. This work shows the 
combined therapeutic and imaging potential of CD-based hybrid materials for the 
treatment of CRC. Future efforts for targeted therapy of chronic diseases 
characterized by altered ECM deposition, such as chronic kidney disease and 
chronic allograft nephropathy in kidney transplant patients are envisaged.

Sirtuin 3 relieves inflammatory responses elicited by lipopolysaccharide via the 
PGC1α-NFκB pathway in bovine mammary epithelial cells.

Excessive inflammation in bovine mammary endothelial cells (BMEC) due to 
mastitis leads to disease progression and eventual culling of cattle. Sirtuin 3 
(SIRT3), a mitochondrial deacetylase, downregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines 
in BMEC exposed to high concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids by blunting 
nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) signaling. In nonruminants, SIRT3 is under the control 
of PGC1α, a transcriptional cofactor. Specific aims were to study (1) the effect 
of SIRT3 on inflammatory responses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenged bovine 
mammary epithelial cells (bovine mammary alveolar cells-T, MAC-T) models, and 
(2) the role of PGC1α in the attenuation of NFκB signaling via SIRT3. To address 
these objectives, first, MAC-T cells were incubated in triplicate with 0, 50, 
100, 150, or 200 μg/mL LPS (derived from Escherichia coli O55:B5) for 12 h with 
or without a 2-h incubation of the NFκB inhibitor ammonium pyrrolidine 
dithiocarbamate (APDC, 10 μM). Second, SIRT3 was overexpressed using adenoviral 
expression (Ad-SIRT3) at different multiplicity of infection (MOI) for 6 h 
followed by a 12 h incubation with 150 μg/mL LPS. Third, cells were treated with 
the PGC1α agonist ZLN005 (10 μg/mL) for 24 h and then challenged with 150 μg/mL 
LPS for 12 h. Fourth, cells were initially treated with the PGC1α inhibitor 
SR-18292 (100 μM) for 6 h followed by a 6-h culture with or without 50 MOI 
Ad-SIRT3 and a challenge with 150 μg/mL LPS for 12 h. Data were analyzed using 
one-way ANOVA with subsequent Bonferroni correction. Linear and quadratic 
contrasts were used to determine dose-responses to LPS. There were linear and 
quadratic effects of LPS dosage on cell viability. Incubation with 150 and 200 
μg/mL LPS for 12 h decreased cell viability to 78.6 and 34.9%, respectively. 
Compared with controls, expression of IL1B, IL6, and TNFA was upregulated by 
5.2-, 5.9-, and 2.7-fold with 150 μg/mL LPS; concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6, and 
tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in cell medium also increased. Compared with the 
LPS group, LPS+APDC increased cell viability and reversed the upregulation of 
IL1B, IL6, and TNFA expression. However, mRNA and protein abundance of SIRT3 
decreased linearly with increasing LPS dose. Ad-SIRT3 infection (50 MOI) reduced 
IL1B, IL6, and TNFA expression and also their concentrations in cell medium, and 
decreased pNFκB P65/NFκB P65 ratio and nuclear abundance of NFκB P65. The PGC1α 
agonist increased SIRT3 expression, whereas it decreased cytokine expression, 
pNFκB P65/NFκB P65 ratio, and prevented NFκB P65 nuclear translocation. Contrary 
to the agonist, the PGC1α inhibitor had opposite effects, and elevated the 
concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in cell medium. Overall, data suggested 
that SIRT3 activity could attenuate LPS-induced inflammatory responses in 
mammary cells via alterations in the PGC1α-NFκB pathway. As such, there may be 
potential benefits for targeting SIRT3 in vivo to help prevent or alleviate 
negative effects of mastitis.

Hemodialysis-Associated Immune Dysregulation in SARS-CoV-2-Infected End-Stage 
Renal Disease Patients.

González-Cuadrado C(1), Caro-Espada PJ(2), Chivite-Lacaba M(1), Utrero-Rico 
A(1), Lozano-Yuste C(2), Gutierrez-Solis E(2), Morales E(1)(2)(3), Sandino-Pérez 
J(2), Gil-Etayo FJ(1)(4), Allende-Martínez L(1)(4), Laguna-Goya R(1)(4)(5), 
Paz-Artal E(1)(4)(5)(6).

Patients on hemodialysis show dysregulated immunity, basal hyperinflammation and 
a marked vulnerability to COVID-19. We evaluated the immune profile in COVID-19 
hemodialysis patients and the changes associated with clinical deterioration 
after the hemodialysis session. Recruited patients included eight hemodialysis 
subjects with active, PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, five uninfected 
hemodialysis patients and five healthy controls. In SARS-CoV-2-infected 
hemodialysis patients TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8 were particularly increased. 
Lymphopenia was mostly due to reduction in CD4+ T, B and central memory CD8+ T 
cells. There was a predominance of classical and intermediate monocytes with 
reduced HLA-DR expression and enhanced production of pro-inflammatory molecules. 
Immune parameters were analysed pre- and post-hemodialysis in three patients 
with COVID-19 symptoms worsening after the hemodialysis session. There was a 
higher than 2.5-fold increase in GM-CSF, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-17A and 
IL-21 in serum, and augmentation of monocytes-derived TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-8 and 
CXCL10 (p < 0.05). In conclusion, COVID-19 in hemodialysis patients associates 
with alteration of lymphocyte subsets, increasing of pro-inflammatory cytokines 
and monocyte activation. The observed worsening during the hemodialysis session 
in some patients was accompanied by augmentation of particular inflammatory 
cytokines, which might suggest biomarkers and therapeutic targets to prevent or 
mitigate the hemodialysis-related deterioration during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Decreased GZMB, NRP1, ITPR1, and SERPINB9 Transcripts Lead to Reduced Regulatory 
T Cells Suppressive Capacity in Generalized Vitiligo Patients.

Giri PS(1), Bharti AH(2), Dwivedi M(1).

Generalized vitiligo (GV) is an autoimmune skin disease characterized by 
bilateral white patches over the entire body. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) 
maintain peripheral tolerance; however, they are found to be reduced in numbers 
and function in vitiligo patients. The exact mechanism for reduced Treg 
suppressive capacity is unknown. Therefore, we aimed to assess transcript levels 
of Tregs-associated immunosuppressive genes (GZMB, NRP1, PDCD1, FASLG, and 
TNFRS18), regulatory molecules of Tregs suppressive function (SERPINB9, ITPR1, 
and UBASH3A), and Treg-associated transcription factors (GATA2, GATA3, RUNX1, 
STAT3, and STAT5) in 52 GV patients and 48 controls by real-time PCR (qPCR). We 
found significantly reduced GZMB, NRP1, SERPINB9, and ITPR1 transcripts in GV 
Tregs compared to controls (p = 0.03, p = 0.023, p = 0.0045, and p < 0.0001, 
respectively). There were 0.44-, 0.45-, 0.32-, and 0.54-fold decrease in GZMB, 
NRP1, SERPINB9, and ITPR1 transcripts in GV Tregs. Additionally, disease 
activity and severity-based analyses revealed significantly decreased GZMB (p = 
0.019 and 0.034), SERPINB9 (p = 0.031 and p = 0.035), and ITPR1 (p = 0.0003 and 
p = 0.034) transcripts in active vitiligo and severe GV patients' Tregs. 
Interestingly, we found a positive correlation for ITPR1 with GZMB (r = 0.45, p 
= 0.0009) and SERPINB9 (r = 0.52, p = 0.001) transcripts in GV Tregs. Moreover, 
we found positive correlation for percentage Treg mediated suppression of CD4+ 
and CD8+T cells with ITPR1 (r = 0.54; r = 0.49), GZMB (r = 0.61; r = 0.58), NRP1 
(r = 0.55; r = 0.52), and SERPINB9 (r = 0.56; r = 0.48) in GV Tregs. Further, 
calcium treatment of Tregs resulted into significantly increased ITPR1, 
SERPINB9, and GZMB transcripts in GV Tregs (p = 0.023, p = 0.0345, p = 0.02). 
Overall, our results for the first time revealed the crucial role of GZMB, NRP1, 
SERPINB9, and ITPR1 transcripts in decreased Treg suppressive capacity leading 
to GV pathogenesis, progression, and severity. In addition, our study 
highlighted that ITPR1 might be linked with decreased GZMB and NRP1 expression 
in GV Tregs. Moreover, our study for the first time suggest that increased 
SERPINB9 transcripts may lead to endogenous granzyme B-mediated Tregs apoptosis, 
and calcium treatment of Tregs may improve the Treg suppressive capacity. These 
findings may further aid in development of Treg-based therapeutics for GV.

AIM: Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) often suffer from perianal fistulizing 
disease. Their risk of anorectal cancer remains uncertain. We aimed to examine 
the long-term risk of anorectal cancer in a population-based cohort of CD 
patients with anorectal fistula.
METHOD: Our study population covered all individuals (n = 7 987 520) aged 15+ 
years living in Denmark from 1978 to 2018. We identified all patients with CD 
and anorectal fistula in the Danish National Patient Register (NPR) and 50 
matched noninflammatory bowel disease (IBD) individuals from the general 
population. Using Cox regression analyses, we examined the risk of anorectal 
cancer in CD fistula patients versus non-IBD individuals. All patients with CD 
were identified using codes from the International Classification of Diseases 
and their data extracted from the NPR. The main outcome measure was cases of 
anorectal cancer.
RESULTS: A total of 2786 CD patients with anorectal fistula and 139 300 non-IBD 
individuals were followed for 1 553 917 person-years. During follow-up, 
anorectal cancer was observed in 19 CD patients (0.68%) and 340 non-IBD 
individuals (0.24%), corresponding to a 2.9-fold increased hazard ratio (HR) of 
anorectal cancer in CD fistula patients (95% CI 1.80-4.53), with a particularly 
high risk of anal cancer (HR 15.13, 95% CI 6.88-33.31) and a mean time from CD 
fistula diagnosis to anorectal cancer of 6.7 (SD 6.5) years. The risk was 
slightly higher in women than men and had no apparent relation to treatment with 
tumour necrosis factor-α inhibitors. Sensitivity analyses using CD nonfistula 
patients for comparison revealed similar results. Individual data on smoking and 
infection with human papilloma virus were not available.
CONCLUSION: Patients with CD and anorectal fistula have a three-fold increased 
risk of anorectal cancer compared with the general population. The number needed 
to surveil to detect one case of anorectal cancer in this patient population was 
2160 patients per year in patients with long-standing fistula (>6 years).

Bacteriophages encode a wide variety of cell wall disrupting enzymes that aid 
the viral escape in the final stages of infection. These lytic enzymes have 
accumulated notable interest due to their potential as novel antibacterials for 
infection treatment caused by multiple-drug resistant bacteria. Here, the 
detailed functional and structural characterization of Thermus parvatiensis 
prophage peptidoglycan lytic amidase AmiP, a globular Amidase_3 type lytic 
enzyme adapted to high temperatures is presented. The sequence and structure 
comparison with homologous lytic amidases reveals the key adaptation traits that 
ensure the activity and stability of AmiP at high temperatures. The crystal 
structure determined at a resolution of 1.8 Å displays a compact α/β-fold with 
multiple secondary structure elements omitted or shortened compared with protein 
structures of similar proteins. The functional characterization of AmiP 
demonstrates high efficiency of catalytic activity and broad substrate 
specificity toward thermophilic and mesophilic bacteria strains containing 
Orn-type or DAP-type peptidoglycan. The here presented AmiP constitutes the most 
thermoactive and ultrathermostable Amidase_3 type lytic enzyme biochemically 
characterized with a temperature optimum at 85°C. The extraordinary high melting 
temperature Tm 102.6°C confirms fold stability up to approximately 100°C. 
Furthermore, AmiP is shown to be more active over the alkaline pH range with pH 
optimum at pH 8.5 and tolerates NaCl up to 300 mM with the activity optimum at 
25 mM NaCl. This set of beneficial characteristics suggests that AmiP can be 
further exploited in biotechnology.

OBJECTIVES: Despite successful treatment, people living with HIV experience 
persisting and burdensome multidimensional problems. We aimed to assess the 
validity, reliability and responsiveness of Positive Outcomes, a 
patient-reported outcome measure for use in clinical practice.
METHODS: In all, 1392 outpatients in five European countries self-completed 
Positive Outcomes, PAM-13 (patient empowerment), PROQOL-HIV (quality of life) 
and FRAIL (frailty) at baseline and 12 months. Analysis assessed: (a) validity 
(structural, convergent and divergent, discriminant); (b) reliability (internal 
consistency, test-retest); and (c) responsiveness.
RESULTS: An interpretable four-factor structure was identified: 'emotional 
wellbeing', 'interpersonal and sexual wellbeing', 'socioeconomic wellbeing' and 
'physical wellbeing'. Moderate to strong convergent validity was found for three 
subscales of Positive Outcomes and PROQOL (ρ = -0.481 to -0.618, all p < 0.001). 
Divergent validity was found for total scores with weak ρ (-0.295, p < 0.001). 
Discriminant validity was confirmed with worse Positive Outcomes score 
associated with increasing odds of worse FRAIL group (4.81-fold, p < 0.001) and 
PAM-13 level (2.28-fold, p < 0.001). Internal consistency for total Positive 
Outcomes and its factors exceeded the conservative α threshold of 0.6. 
Test-retest reliability was established: those with stable PAM-13 and FRAIL 
scores also reported median Positive Outcomes change of 0. Improved PROQOL-HIV 
score baseline to 12 months was associated with improved Positive Outcomes score 
(r = -0.44, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Positive Outcomes face and content validity was previously 
established, and the remaining validity, reliability and responsiveness 
properties are now demonstrated. The items within the brief 22-item tool are 
designed to be actionable by health and social care professionals to facilitate 
the goal of person-centred care.

Berberat J(8)(10).

BACKGROUND: The meninges, formed by dura, arachnoid and pia mater, cover the 
central nervous system and provide important barrier functions. Located between 
arachnoid and pia mater, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled subarachnoid space 
(SAS) features a variety of trabeculae, septae and pillars. Like the arachnoid 
and the pia mater, these structures are covered with leptomeningeal or 
meningothelial cells (MECs) that form a barrier between CSF and the parenchyma 
of the optic nerve (ON). MECs contribute to the CSF proteome through extensive 
protein secretion. In vitro, they were shown to phagocytose potentially toxic 
proteins, such as α-synuclein and amyloid beta, as well as apoptotic cell 
bodies. They therefore may contribute to CSF homeostasis in the SAS as a 
functional exchange surface. Determining the total area of the SAS covered by 
these cells that are in direct contact with CSF is thus important for estimating 
their potential contribution to CSF homeostasis.
METHODS: Using synchrotron radiation-based micro-computed tomography (SRµCT), 
two 0.75 mm-thick sections of a human optic nerve were acquired at a resolution 
of 0.325 µm/pixel, producing images of multiple terabytes capturing the 
geometrical details of the CSF space. Special-purpose supercomputing techniques 
were employed to obtain a pixel-accurate morphometric description of the 
trabeculae and estimate internal volume and surface area of the ON SAS.
RESULTS: In the bulbar segment, the ON SAS microstructure is shown to amplify 
the MECs surface area up to 4.85-fold compared to an "empty" ON SAS, while just 
occupying 35% of the volume. In the intraorbital segment, the microstructure 
occupies 35% of the volume and amplifies the ON SAS area 3.24-fold.
CONCLUSIONS: We provided for the first time an estimation of the interface area 
between CSF and MECs. This area is of importance for estimating a potential 
contribution of MECs on CSF homeostasis.

Cellulose is the most abundant natural polymer on Earth, representing an 
attractive feedstock for bioproducts and biofuel production. Cellulases promote 
the depolymerization of cellulose, generating short oligosaccharides and 
glucose, which are useful in biotechnological applications. Among the classical 
cellulases, those from glycoside hydrolase family 5 (GH5) are one of the most 
abundant in Nature, displaying several modular architectures with other 
accessory domains attached to its catalytic core, such as carbohydrate-binding 
modules (CBMs), Ig-like, FN3-like, and Calx-β domains, which can influence the 
enzyme activity. The metagenome-derived endoglucanase CelE2 has in its modular 
architecture an N-terminal domain belonging to the GH5 family and a C-terminal 
domain with a high identity to the Calx-β domain. In this study, the GH5 and the 
Calx-β domains were subcloned and heterologously expressed in E. coli, to 
evaluate the structural and functional properties of the individualized domains 
of CelE2. Thermostability analysis by circular dichroism (CD) revealed a 
decrease in the denaturation temperature values around 4.6 °C for the catalytic 
domain (CelE21-381) compared to CelE2 full-length. The CD analyses revealed that 
the Calx-β domain (CelE2382-477) was unfolded, suggesting that this domain 
requires to be attached to the catalytic core to become structurally stable. The 
three-dimensional structure of the catalytic domain CelE21-381 was determined at 
2.1 Å resolution, showing a typical (α/β)8-barrel fold and a narrow active site 
compared to other cellulases from the same family. The biochemical 
characterization showed that the deletion of the Calx-β domain increased more 
than 3-fold the activity of the catalytic domain CelE21-381 towards the 
insoluble substrate Avicel. The main functional properties of CelE2, such as 
substrate specificity, optimal pH and temperature, thermal stability, and 
activation by CaCl2, were not altered after the deletion of the accessory 
domain. Furthermore, the Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) analyses showed 
that the addition of CaCl2 was beneficial CelE21-381 protein solvency. This work 
contributed to fundamental concepts about the structure and function of 
cellulases, which are useful in applications involving lignocellulosic materials 
degradation into food and feedstuffs and biofuel production.

BACKGROUND: ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in young male 
patients accounts for a significant proportion of total heart attack events. 
Therefore, clinical awareness and screening for acute myocardial infarction 
(AMI) in asymptomatic patients at a young age is required. The gut microbiome is 
potentially involved in the pathogenesis of STEMI. The aim of the current study 
is to develop an early risk prediction model based on the gut microbiome and 
clinical parameters for this population.
METHODS: A total of 81 young males (age < 44 years) were enrolled in this study. 
Forty-one young males with STEMI were included in the case group, and the 
control group included 40 young non-coronary artery disease (CAD) males. To 
identify the differences in gut microbiome markers between these two groups, 16S 
rRNA-based gut microbiome sequencing was performed using the Illumina MiSeq 
platform. Further, a nomogram and corresponding web page were constructed. The 
diagnostic efficacy and practicability of the model were analyzed using K-fold 
cross-validation, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULTS: Compared to the control group, a significant decrease in tendency 
regarding α and β diversity was observed in patients in the case group and 
identified as a significantly altered gut microbiome represented by 
Streptococcus and Prevotella. Regarding clinical parameters, compared to the 
control group, the patients in the case group had a higher body mass index 
(BMI), systolic blood pressure (SBP), triglyceride (TG), alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and low blood urea 
nitrogen (BUN). Additionally, BMI and SBP were significantly (p<0.05) positively 
correlated with Streptococcus and [Ruminococcus]. Further, BMI and SBP were 
significantly (p<0.05) negatively correlated with Prevotella and Megasphaera. A 
significant negative correlation was only observed between Prevotella and AST 
(p < 0.05). Finally, an early predictive nomogram and corresponding web page 
were constructed based on the gut microbiome and clinical parameters with an 
area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.877 and 
a C-index of 0.911. For the internal validation, the stratified K-fold 
cross-validation (K = 3) was as follows: AUC value of 0.934. The calibration 
curves of the model showed good consistency between the actual and predicted 
probabilities. The DCA results showed that the model had a high net clinical 
benefit for use in the clinical setting.
CONCLUSION: In this study, we combined the gut microbiome and common clinical 
parameters to construct a prediction model. Our analysis shows that the 
constructed model is a non-invasive tool with potential clinical application in 
predicting STEMI in the young males.

Serum samples of 20 hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients 
from Brazil who were infected by the earlier severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lineages B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33, and by the variant of 
concern (VOC) Gamma (P.1) were tested by plaque reduction neutralization test 
(PRNT90) with wild isolates of a panel of SARS-CoV-2 lineages, including B.1, 
Zeta, N.10, and the VOCs Gamma, Alpha, and Delta that emerged in different 
timeframes of the pandemic. The main objective of this study was to evaluate if 
the serum of patients infected by earlier lineages was capable to neutralize 
later emerged VOCs. We also evaluated if the 4-fold difference in PRNT90 titers 
is a reliable seropositivity criterion to distinguish infections caused by 
different SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Sera collected between May 2020 and August 2021 
from the day of admittance to the hospital to 21 days after diagnostic of 
patients infected by the two earlier lineages B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33 presented 
neutralizing capacity for all challenged VOCs, including Gamma and Delta. Among 
all variants tested, Delta and N.10 presented the lowest geometric mean of 
neutralizing antibody titers, and B.1.1.7, presented the highest titers. Four 
patients infected with Gamma, that emerged in December 2020, presented 
neutralizing antibodies for B.1, B.1.1.33, and B.1.1.28, its ancestor lineage. 
All of them had neutralizing antibodies under the level of detection for the VOC 
Delta. Patients infected by B.1.1.28 presented very similar geometric mean of 
neutralizing antibody titers for both B.1.1.33 and B.1.1.28. Findings presented 
here indicate that most patients infected in early stages of COVID-19 pandemic 
presented neutralizing antibodies capable to neutralize wild types of all later 
emerged VOCs in Brazil, and that the 4-fold difference in PRNT90 titers is not 
reliable to distinguish humoral response among different SARS-CoV-2 lineages.

Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug Conjugated with Gadolinium (III) Complex as 
an Anti-Inflammatory MRI Agent.

Studies have been actively conducted to ensure that gadolinium-based contrast 
agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are accompanied by various 
biological functions. A new example is the anti-inflammatory theragnostic MRI 
agent to target inflammatory mediators for imaging diagnosis and to treat 
inflammatory diseases simultaneously. We designed, synthesized, and 
characterized a Gd complex of 1,4,7-tris(carboxymethylaza) 
cyclododecane-10-azaacetylamide (DO3A) conjugated with a nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that exerts the innate therapeutic effect of 
NSAIDs and is also applicable in MRI diagnostics. Gd-DO3A-fen (0.1 mmol/kg) was 
intravenously injected into the turpentine oil-induced mouse model, with 
Gd-DO3A-BT as a control group. In the in vivo MRI experiment, the 
contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) was higher and persisted longer than that with 
Gd-DO3A-BT; specifically, the CNR difference was almost five times at 2 h after 
injection. Gd-DO3A-fen had a binding affinity (Ka) of 6.68 × 106 M-1 for the 
COX-2 enzyme, which was 2.1-fold higher than that of fenbufen, the original 
NSAID. In vivo evaluation of anti-inflammatory activity was performed in two 
animal models. In the turpentine oil-induced model, the mRNA expression levels 
of inflammatory parameters such as COX-2, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 were reduced, 
and in the carrageenan-induced edema model, swelling was suppressed by 72% and 
there was a 2.88-fold inhibition compared with the saline group. Correlation 
analysis between in vitro, in silico, and in vivo studies revealed that 
Gd-DO3A-fen acts as an anti-inflammatory theragnostic agent by directly binding 
to COX-2.

Generated by the immune system post-infection or through vaccination, the 
effectiveness of antibodies against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants is crucial for 
protecting individuals from the COVID-19 pandemic. Herein, a platform for the 
multiplexed evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies against various 
variants was designed on the basis of near-infrared (NIR) surface enhanced 
fluorescence by nano-plasmonic gold chip (pGOLD). Antibody level across variants 
(Wild-type, Alpha, Beta, Delta, Omicron) was confirmed by the sera from 
recovered-individuals who were unvaccinated and had infected with Wild-type, 
Delta, Omicron variants. However, the neutralizing activity against Omicron 
variant was markedly decreased for individuals infected by Wild-type 
(~ 5.6-fold) and Delta variant (~ 19.1-fold). To the opposite, neutralizing 
antibody from individuals recovered from Omicron variant infection showed weak 
binding strength against non-Omicron variants. Antibody evolution over time was 
studied with individuals 196-530 days post Wild-type infection. Decreasing IgG 
antibody titer accompanied by increasing IgG binding avidity with elongated 
post-infection period were observed for the sera from Wild-type 
recovered-individuals with different post-infection times, suggesting that after 
the primary infection, a great number of antibodies were generated and then 
gradually decreased, while the antibody matured over time. By comparing the IgG 
level of individuals vaccinated for 27-51 days with individual post-infection, 
we found that ca. 1 month after two doses of vaccination, the antibody level was 
comparable to that of 500 days post-infection, and vaccination could enhance IgG 
avidity more efficiently. This work demonstrated a platform for the multiplexed, 
high-throughput and rapid screening of acquired immunity against SARS-CoV-2 
variants, providing a new approach for the analysis of vaccine effectiveness, 
immunity against emerging variants, and related serological study.

MicroRNA-195a-5p Regulates Blood Pressure by Inhibiting NKCC2A.

Hao S(1), Zhao H(1), Hao DH(1), Ferreri NR(1).

BACKGROUND: Previous studies showed that miR-195a-5p was among the most abundant 
microRNAs (miRNAs) expressed in the kidney.
METHODS: Lentivirus silencing of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) was performed in 
vivo and in vitro. Luciferase reporter assays confirmed that 
bumetanide-sensitive Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter isoform A (NKCC2A) mRNA is 
targeted and repressed by miR-195a-5p. Radiotelemetry was used to measure mean 
arterial pressure.
RESULTS: TNF upregulates mmu-miR-195a-5p, and -203 and downregulates mmu-miR-30c 
and -100 in the medullary thick ascending limb of male mice. miR-195a-5p was 
>3-fold higher in the renal outer medulla of mice given an intrarenal injection 
of murine recombinant TNF, whereas silencing TNF inhibited miR-195a-5p 
expression by ≈51%. Transient transfection of a miR-195a-5p mimic into medullary 
thick ascending limb cells suppressed NKCC2A mRNA by ≈83%, whereas transfection 
with Anti-miR-195a-5p increased NKCC2A mRNA. Silencing TNF in medullary thick 
ascending limb cells prevented increases in miR-195 induced by 400 mosmol/kg H2O 
medium, an effect reversed by transfection with a miR-195a-5p mimic. Expression 
of phosphorylated NKCC2 increased 1.5-fold in medullary thick ascending limb 
cells transfected with Anti-miR-195a-5p and a miR-195a-5p mimic prevented the 
increase, which was induced by silencing TNF in cells exposed to 400 mosmol/kg 
H2O medium after osmolality was increased by adding NaCl. Intrarenal injection 
of TNF suppressed NKCC2A mRNA, whereas injection of miR-195a-5p prevented the 
increase of NKCC2A mRNA abundance and phosphorylated NKCC2 expression when TNF 
was silenced. Intrarenal injection with miR-195a-5p markedly attenuated MAP 
after renal silencing of TNF in mice given 1% NaCl.
CONCLUSIONS: The study identifies miR-195a-5p as a salt-sensitive and 
TNF-inducible miRNA that attenuates NaCl-mediated increases in blood pressure by 
inhibiting NKCC2A.

13-amino derivatives of dehydrocostus lactone display greatly enhanced selective 
toxicity against breast cancer cells and improved binding energies to protein 
kinases in silico.

The biological activities of dehydrocostus lactone and its analogues are 
suggested to be mediated by the lactone ring and α,β-methylene-γ-lactone. 
However, few studies exist on the structure-activity relationship of 13-amino 
derivatives of dehydrocostus latone. In this study new 13-amino derivatives of 
dehydrocostus lactone DHLC (1-4) were synthesized through Michael addition 
reactions, and were screened against three different breast cancer cell lines, 
namely hormone receptor positive breast cancer (MCF-7), triple-negative breast 
cancer (HCC70), and non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial (MCF-12A) cell lines. 
Dehydrocostus lactone (DHLC) exhibited IC50 values of 1.11 (selectivity index 
(SI) = 0.06), 24.70 (SI = 0.01) and 0.07 μM against HCC70, MCF-7 and MCF-12A 
cells, respectively. All the amino derivatives, except DHLC-3 displayed low 
micromolar IC50 values (ranging from 0.07-4.24 μM) against both breast cancer 
cell lines, with reduced toxicity towards MCF-12A non-tumorigenic mammary 
epithelial cells (SI values ranging from 6.00-126.86). DHLC-1 and DHLC-2 
demonstrated the greatest selectivity for the MCF-7 cells (with SI of 121 and 
126.86 respectively) over the MCF-12A cells. This reveals that, overall, the 
derivatives display greatly improved selectivity for breast cancer over 
non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells, with between 100-fold and 12 000-fold 
higher SI values. The improved docking scores were recorded for all the 13-amino 
dehydrocostus lactone derivatives for the enzymes analyzed. Compounds DHLC-4, 
and DHLC-3 recorded higher docking scores of -7.33 and -5.97 Kca/mol 
respectively, compared to the parent structure, dehydrocostus lactone (-5.34 
Kca/mol) for protein kinase (PKC) theta (1XJD) and -6.22 and -5.88 Kca/mol, 
respectively for protein kinase iota (1RZR). The compounds further showed 
promising predicted adsorption, distribution, metabolisms and excretion (ADME) 
properties. Predicting the ADME properties of these derivatives is of importance 
in evaluating their drug-likeness, which could in turn be developed into 
potential drug candidates.

B.1.1.7 lineage SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible, leads to greater clinical 
severity, and results in modest reductions in antibody neutralization. 
Subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) is produced by discontinuous transcription of the 
SARS-CoV-2 genome. Applying our tool (periscope) to ARTIC Network Oxford 
Nanopore Technologies genomic sequencing data from 4400 SARS-CoV-2 positive 
clinical samples, we show that normalised sgRNA is significantly increased in 
B.1.1.7 (alpha) infections (n = 879). This increase is seen over the previous 
dominant lineage in the UK, B.1.177 (n = 943), which is independent of genomic 
reads, E cycle threshold and days since symptom onset at sampling. A 
noncanonical sgRNA which could represent ORF9b is found in 98.4% of B.1.1.7 
SARS-CoV-2 infections compared with only 13.8% of other lineages, with a 16-fold 
increase in median sgRNA abundance. We demonstrate that ORF9b protein levels are 
increased 6-fold in B.1.1.7 compared to a B lineage virus in vitro. We 
hypothesise that increased ORF9b in B.1.1.7 is a direct consequence of a triple 
nucleotide mutation in nucleocapsid (28280:GAT > CAT, D3L) creating a 
transcription regulatory-like sequence complementary to a region 3' of the 
genomic leader. These findings provide a unique insight into the biology of 
B.1.1.7 and support monitoring of sgRNA profiles to evaluate emerging potential 
variants of concern.

Predictors and incidence of depression and anxiety in women undergoing 
infertility treatment: A cross-sectional study.

Wang L(1), Tang Y(2), Wang Y(1).

The global incidence of infertility is increasing year by year, and the 
association between infertility and mental illness has been widely concerned. 
The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of anxiety and depression 
in infertile women in China and explore the risk factors which might lead to 
anxiety and depression. From January 2020 to December 2020, female infertile 
patients who received assisted reproduction technology (ART) treatment at West 
China Second Hospital were recruited and a total of 1712 eligible female 
patients were finally enrolled in this study. Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 
(GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionaire-9 (PHQ-9) were used to evaluate the 
patients' psychological status. The reliability of all scales was evaluated by 
Cronbach's α and Spearman-Brown half coefficient, and Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) 
value was calculated by factor analysis to evaluate validity. Univariate and 
multivariate logistic regression analysis were applied for assessing independent 
risk factors of anxiety and depression, respectively. The incidence of anxiety 
and depression in infertile women were 25.2% and 31.3%, respectively. Cronbach's 
α coefficients and Spearman-Brown half-fold coefficients of GAD-7 and PHQ-9 were 
0.870, 0.825, 0.852 and 0.793, respectively. Univariate and multivariate 
logistic regression analysis showed that education level (junior college degree 
or above, OR:1. 6, 95% CI: 1.2-2.1, P = 0.003), somatic symptoms (severe somatic 
symptoms, OR:15.2, 95%CI: 5.6-41.3, P<0.001), sleep quality (poor sleep quality, 
OR:9.3, 95% CI:4.7-18.4, P<0.001) were independent risk factors for anxiety. And 
age>35 years old, moderate and severe somatic symptoms and poor sleep quality 
were independent risk factors for depression. Somatic symptoms and poor sleep 
quality are both the risk factors of anxiety and depression symptoms of 
infertile woman. And high educated (junior college degree or above) patients are 
more likely to be complicated with anxiety symptoms, while elderly patients 
(age>35) are prone to be complicated with depression symptoms.

In-depth proteomic signature of parathyroid carcinoma.

Kong SH(1)(2), Lee JH(3), Bae JM(4), Hong N(5), Kim H(6), Park SY(7), Choi 
YJ(8), Lee S(9), Rhee Y(5), Kim SW(2)(10), Han D(6)(11), Kim JH(2)(12), Shin 
CS(2)(12).

OBJECTIVE: Diagnosing parathyroid carcinoma (PC) is complicated and 
controversial that early diagnosis and intervention are often difficult. 
Therefore, we aimed to elucidate the protein signatures of PC through 
quantitative proteomic analyses to aid in the early and accurate diagnosis of 
PC.
DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: We performed liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry using 
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples. For the analyses, 23 PC and 15 
parathyroid adenoma (PA) tissues were collected from 6 tertiary hospitals in 
South Korea.
RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 52 years, and 63% were women. 
Proteomic expression profiling revealed 304 differentially expressed proteins 
(DEPs) with a cut-off of P < .05 and fold change >1.5. Among DEPs, we identified 
a set of 5 proteins that can discriminate PC from PA: carbonic anhydrase 4 
(CA4), alpha/beta hydrolase domain-containing protein 14B (ABHD14B), laminin 
subunit beta-2 (LAMB2), CD44 antigen (CD44), and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 
(ORM1) that exhibited the highest area under the curve of 0.991 in neural 
network model. The nuclear percentage of CA4 and LAMB2 in immunohistochemistry 
was significantly lower in PC tissue than in the PA (CA4: 2.77 ± 1.96%, 26.2 ± 
3.45%, P < .001; LAMB2: 6.86 ± 3.46%, 38.54 ± 4.13%, P < .001). The most 
enriched canonical pathways in PC included glycoprotein-6 signaling and 
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR).
CONCLUSIONS: We identified key proteins differentially expressed between PC and 
PA using proteomic analyses of parathyroid neoplasms. These findings may help to 
diagnose PC accurately and elucidate potential therapeutic targets.

Creation of human hematopoietic chimeric cell (HHCC) line as a novel strategy 
for tolerance induction in transplantation.

Siemionow M(1), Brodowska S(1), Różczka K(1), Roesler C(1).

BACKGROUND: Cell-based and chimerism-based therapies represent a promising 
approach for tolerance induction in transplantation. We propose a new cell 
therapy of the ex vivo created human hematopoietic chimeric cells (HHCC) as an 
alternative approach to bone marrow (BM)-based therapies in support of solid 
organ and vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA). This study aimed to 
characterize in vitro the phenotype, genotype, clonogenic, and tolerogenic 
properties of HHCC.
METHODS: Thirty ex vivo fusions of CD34+ cells from two unrelated human BM 
donors were performed. CD34+ cells were stained separately with PKH26 and PKH67 
membrane dyes and fused using polyethylene glycol (PEG). Creation of human HHCC 
and chimeric state was confirmed by flow cytometry (FC), confocal microscopy 
(CM) and electron microscopy (EM). HHCC's phenotype (CD34, CD133, CD117, CD4, 
CD19, CD4/CD25) was assessed by FC, viability by Trypan Blue, LIVE/DEAD and 
apoptosis by AnnexinV/Sytox Blue and TUNEL assay, while mixed lymphocyte 
reaction (MLR) assay assessed HHCC's immunogenicity and tolerogenic properties. 
HHCC differentiation, proliferation and clonogenic potential were assessed by 
the colony forming unit (CFU). Polyploidy was evaluated by fluorescence in situ 
hybridization (FISH), whereas polymerase chain reaction-reverse 
sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe (PCR-rSSOP) and short tandem 
repeats-polymerase chain reaction (STR-PCR) assessed HHCC's genotype, and 
chimerism. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyzed 
cytokines secretion [interleukin (IL)-10, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) 
and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)] up to 14 days post-fusion.
RESULTS: FC and CM confirmed creation of HHCC by fusion of CD34+ cells from two 
unrelated human donors. After fusion, maintenance of hematopoietic markers and 
increased expression of Treg-cells (CD4/CD25) was confirmed. Moreover, high HHCC 
viability (99%) and a low apoptosis rate (1.2%) were revealed HHCC presented 
decreased immunogenicity by MLR, and significant, 40-fold increase of IL-10 the 
pro-tolerogenic cytokine at 21 days after fusion (RT-PCR) P<0.0001. The number 
of polyploid cells was negligible (0.48%). PCR-rSSOP of HHCC after fusion 
confirmed presence of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and class II-alleles 
and presence of the loci specific for both CD34+ cells BM donors by STR-PCR.
CONCLUSIONS: We have created a new hematopoietic cell line of HHCC from two 
unrelated human donors, and have successfully characterized in vitro, viability, 
phenotype, genotype, clonogenic, and tolerogenic properties of HHCC. These 
unique immunomodulatory and tolerogenic properties introduce HHCC as a novel 
therapeutic approach for tolerance induction in VCA and solid organ 
transplantation.

Transcriptome Profiling in the Hippocampi of Mice with Experimental Autoimmune 
Encephalomyelitis.

Weerasinghe-Mudiyanselage PDE(1), Kang S(1), Kim JS(1), Kim JC(1), Kim SH(1), 
Wang H(2), Shin T(3), Moon C(1).

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple 
sclerosis (MS), approximates the key histopathological, clinical, and 
immunological features of MS. Hippocampal dysfunction in MS and EAE causes 
varying degrees of cognitive and emotional impairments and synaptic 
abnormalities. However, the molecular alterations underlying hippocampal 
dysfunctions in MS and EAE are still under investigation. The purpose of this 
study was to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the hippocampus 
of mice with EAE in order to ascertain potential genes associated with 
hippocampal dysfunction. Gene expression in the hippocampus was analyzed by 
RNA-sequencing and validated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase 
chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Gene expression analysis revealed 1202 DEGs; 1023 were 
upregulated and 179 were downregulated in the hippocampus of mice with EAE 
(p-value < 0.05 and fold change >1.5). Gene ontology (GO) analysis showed that 
the upregulated genes in the hippocampi of mice with EAE were associated with 
immune system processes, defense responses, immune responses, and regulation of 
immune responses, whereas the downregulated genes were related to learning or 
memory, behavior, and nervous system processes in the GO biological process. The 
expressions of hub genes from the search tool for the retrieval of interacting 
genes/proteins (STRING) analysis were validated by RT-qPCR. Additionally, gene 
set enrichment analysis showed that the upregulated genes in the hippocampus 
were associated with inflammatory responses: interferon-γ responses, allograft 
rejection, interferon-α responses, IL6_JAK_STAT3 signaling, inflammatory 
responses, complement, IL2_STAT5 signaling, TNF-α signaling via NF-κB, and 
apoptosis, whereas the downregulated genes were related to synaptic plasticity, 
dendritic development, and development of dendritic spine. This study 
characterized the transcriptome pattern in the hippocampi of mice with EAE and 
signaling pathways underpinning hippocampal dysfunction. However, further 
investigation is needed to determine the applicability of these findings from 
this rodent model to patients with MS. Collectively, these results indicate 
directions for further research to understand the mechanisms behind hippocampal 
dysfunction in EAE.

High risk oral contraceptive hormones do not directly enhance endothelial cell 
procoagulant activity in vitro.

Bouck EG(1), Arvanitis M(2), Osburn WO(2), Sang Y(1), Reventun P(2), Ahmadzia 
HK(3), Smith NL(4)(5)(6), Lowenstein CJ(2), Wolberg AS(1).

BACKGROUND: Oral contraceptive (OC) use increases venous thromboembolism risk 
2-5-fold. Procoagulant changes can be detected in plasma from OC users even 
without thrombosis, but cellular mechanisms that provoke thrombosis have not 
been identified. Endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction is thought to initiate venous 
thromboembolism. It is unknown whether OC hormones provoke aberrant procoagulant 
activity in ECs.
OBJECTIVE: Characterize the effect of high-risk OC hormones (ethinyl estradiol 
[EE] and drospirenone) on EC procoagulant activity and the potential interplay 
with nuclear estrogen receptors ERα and ERβ and inflammatory processes.
METHODS: Human umbilical vein and dermal microvascular ECs (HUVEC and HDMVEC, 
respectively) were treated with EE and/or drospirenone. Genes encoding the 
estrogen receptors ERα and ERβ (ESR1 and ESR2, respectively) were overexpressed 
in HUVEC and HDMVEC via lentiviral vectors. EC gene expression was assessed by 
RT-qPCR. The ability of ECs to support thrombin generation and fibrin formation 
was measured by calibrated automated thrombography and spectrophotometry, 
respectively.
RESULTS: Neither EE nor drospirenone, alone or together, changed expression of 
genes encoding anti- or procoagulant proteins (TFPI, THBD, F3), integrins 
(ITGAV, ITGB3), or fibrinolytic mediators (SERPINE1, PLAT). EE and/or 
drospirenone did not increase EC-supported thrombin generation or fibrin 
formation, either. Our analyses indicated a subset of individuals express ESR1 
and ESR2 transcripts in human aortic ECs. However, overexpression of ESR1 and/or 
ESR2 in HUVEC and HDMVEC did not facilitate the ability of OC-treated ECs to 
support procoagulant activity, even in the presence of a pro-inflammatory 
stimulus.
CONCLUSIONS: The OC hormones EE and drospirenone do not directly enhance 
thrombin generation potential of primary ECs in vitro.

Structural and Mechanistic Basis for the Inactivation of Human Ornithine 
Aminotransferase by (3S,4S)-3-Amino-4-fluorocyclopentenecarboxylic Acid.

Shen S(1), Butrin A(2), Beaupre BA(2), Ferreira GM(3), Doubleday PF(4)(5), Grass 
DH(1), Zhu W(1), Kelleher NL(1)(4)(5), Moran GR(2), Liu D(2), Silverman 
RB(1)(4)(6).

Ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC), and we previously showed that inactivation of OAT inhibits the growth of 
HCC. Recently, we found that (3S,4S)-3-amino-4-fluorocyclopentenecarboxylic acid 
(5) was a potent inactivator of γ-aminobutyric acid aminotransferase (GABA-AT), 
proceeding by an enamine mechanism. Here we describe our investigations into the 
activity and mechanism of 5 as an inactivator of human OAT. We have found that 5 
exhibits 10-fold less inactivation efficiency (kinact/KI) against hOAT than 
GABA-AT. A comprehensive mechanistic study was carried out to understand its 
inactivation mechanism with hOAT. pKa and electrostatic potential calculations 
were performed to further support the notion that the α,β-unsaturated alkene of 
5 is critical for enhancing acidity and nucleophilicity of the corresponding 
intermediates and ultimately responsible for the improved inactivation 
efficiency of 5 over the corresponding saturated analogue (4). Intact protein 
mass spectrometry and the crystal structure complex with hOAT provide evidence 
to conclude that 5 mainly inactivates hOAT through noncovalent interactions, and 
that, unlike with GABA-AT, covalent binding with hOAT is a minor component of 
the total inhibition which is unique relative to other monofluoro-substituted 
derivatives. Furthermore, based on the results of transient-state measurements 
and free energy calculations, it is suggested that the α,β-unsaturated 
carboxylate group of PLP-bound 5 may be directly involved in the inactivation 
cascade by forming an enolate intermediate. Overall, compound 5 exhibits unusual 
structural conversions which are catalyzed by specific residues within hOAT, 
ultimately leading to an enamine mechanism-based inactivation of hOAT through 
noncovalent interactions and covalent modification.

Numerous vaccines have been developed to address the current COVID-19 pandemic, 
but safety, cross-neutralizing efficacy, and long-term protectivity of currently 
approved vaccines are still important issues. In this study, we developed a 
subunit vaccine, ASD254, by using a nanoparticle vaccine platform to encapsulate 
the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein. As compared with the 
aluminum-adjuvant RBD vaccine, ASD254 induced higher titers of RBD-specific 
antibodies and generated 10- to 30-fold more neutralizing antibodies. Mice 
vaccinated with ASD254 showed protective immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 
challenge, with undetectable infectious viral loads and reduced typical lesions 
in lung. Besides, neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated mice lasted for at least 
one year and were effective against various SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, 
including B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 (Gamma), B.1.617.2 (Delta), and 
B.1.1.529 (Omicron). Furthermore, particle size, polydispersity index, and 
zeta-potential of ASD254 remained stable after 8-month storage at 4°C. Thus, 
ASD254 is a promising nanoparticle vaccine with good immunogenicity and 
stability to be developed as an effective vaccine option in controlling upcoming 
waves of COVID-19.

M(1), Yao Z(1), Fu H(1), Cao J(1), Fan X(1).

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern 
(VOCs) have prolonged coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic by escaping 
pre-existing immunity acquired by natural infection or vaccination. Elucidation 
of VOCs' mutation trends and evasion of neutralization is required to update 
current control measures. Mutations and the prevalence of VOCs were analyzed in 
the global immunization coverage rate context. Lentivirus-based pseudovirus 
neutralization analysis platforms for SARS-CoV-2 prototype strain (PS) and VOCs, 
containing Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron, were constructed based on the 
spike protein of each variant and HEK 293T cell line expressing the human 
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor on the surface, and an enhanced 
green fluorescent protein reporter. Serum samples from 65 convalescent 
individuals and 20 WIBP-CorV vaccine recipients and four therapeutic monoclonal 
antibodies (mAbs) namely imdevimab, casirivimab, bamlanivimab, and etesevimab 
were used to evaluate the neutralization potency against the variants. 
Pseudovirus-based neutralization assay platforms for PS and VOCs were 
established, and multiplicity of infection (MOI) was the key factor influencing 
the assay result. Compared to PS, VOCs may enhance the infectivity of hACE2-293T 
cells. Except for Alpha, other VOCs escaped neutralization to varying degrees. 
Attributed to favorable and emerging mutations, the current pandemic Omicron 
variant of all VOCs demonstrated the most significant neutralization-escaping 
ability to the sera and mAbs. Compared with the PS pseudovirus, Omicron had 
15.7- and 3.71-fold decreases in the NT50 value (the highest serum dilution 
corresponding to a neutralization rate of 50%); and correspondingly, 90% and 43% 
of immunization or convalescent serum samples lost their neutralizing activity 
against the Omicron variant, respectively. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 has evolved 
persistently with a strong ability to escape neutralization and prevailing 
against the established immune barrier. Our findings provide important clues to 
controlling the COVID-19 pandemic caused by new variants.

The effects of acute exercise and inflammation on immune function in early-stage 
prostate cancer.

Schauer T(1), Djurhuus SS(1), Simonsen C(1), Brasso K(2)(3), Christensen 
JF(1)(4)(5).

BACKGROUND: The immune system plays a vital role in cancer development and 
progression. Strategies mobilizing cytotoxic cells of the immune system to 
combat immunosuppression in cancer may help to improve the treatment response of 
patients. To this end, we aimed to characterize the anti-cancer effect of acute 
exercise, including the involvement of inflammatory signals.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with early-stage prostate cancer (PCa) 
scheduled to undergo prostatectomy performed one bout of acute exercise 
consisting of a watt-max test and four high-intensity intervals. Natural Killer 
(NK), NKT-like and T cell phenotype, NK cell cytotoxic activity (NKCA), and NKCA 
per-cell against cell lines of leukemia (K562) and prostate cancer origin (LNCaP 
and PC-3) were assessed. Inflammatory markers (TNF-α, IL-6, and CRP) were 
measured in plasma.
RESULTS: Exercise increased NK, NKT-like, and CD8 T cell concentration in the 
circulation. Furthermore, exercise shifted immune cells towards a mature and 
cytotoxic phenotype e.g., NK cells exhibited higher CD57 as well as lower NKG2A 
expression. NKT-like and CD8 cells exhibited elevated CD57, TIGIT and Granzyme-B 
expression. Exercise significantly improved NKCA against K562 (+16% [5%; 27%]; 
p = 0.002) and LNCaP (+24% [14%; 34%]; p < 0.001) but not PC-3. NKCA per NK cell 
decreased during exercise and increased 1-h post exercise compared to baseline 
in K562, LNCap, and PC-3 cell lines. Baseline IL-6 correlated with lymphocyte, 
monocyte and T cell concentration pre-exercise and inversely correlated with the 
fold-change of mobilized lymphocytes and CD8 T cells during exercise. 
Furthermore, baseline IL-6 and TNF-α inversely correlated with NKCA against 
PC-3 cells during exercise.
CONCLUSIONS: Acute exercise mobilized cytotoxic immune cells and improved NKCA 
in patients with PCa whereas low-grade inflammation might impair the response. 
Whether the observed improvements impact long-term outcomes warrant further 
investigation.

Wilund KR(5), Paluska SA(6), Burd NA(5), Haus JM(7).

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this investigation was to evaluate circulating and 
skeletal muscle inflammatory biomarkers between maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) 
and demographic-matched control subjects (CON) before and after ingestion of a 
protein-rich meal.
DESIGN AND METHODS: CON (n = 8; 50 ± 2 years; 31 ± 1 kg/m2) and MHD patients 
(n = 8; 56 ± 5 years; 32 ± 2 kg/m2) underwent a basal blood draw and muscle 
biopsy and serial blood draws after the ingestion of a mixed meal on a 
nondialysis day. Plasma advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and markers of 
oxidation were assessed via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry 
before and after the meal (+240 min). Circulating inflammatory cytokines and 
soluble receptors for AGE (sRAGE) isoforms (endogenous secretory RAGEs and 
cleaved RAGEs) were determined before and after the meal (+240 min). Basal 
muscle was probed for inflammatory cytokines and protein expression of related 
signaling components (RAGE, Toll-like receptor 4, oligosaccharyltransferase 
subunit 48, TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β, total IκBα, and 
pIκBα).
RESULTS: Basal circulating AGEs were 7- to 343-fold higher (P < .001) in MHD 
than those in CON, but only MG-H1 increased in CON after the meal (P < .001). 
There was a group effect (MHD > CON) for total sRAGEs (P = .02) and endogenous 
secretory RAGEs (P < .001) and a trend for cleaved RAGEs (P=.09), with no meal 
effect. In addition, there was a group effect (MHD < CON; P < .05) for 
circulating fractalkine, interleukin (IL)10, IL17A, and IL1β and a trend 
(P < .10) for IL6 and macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha, whereas tumor 
necrosis factor alpha was higher in MHD (P < .001). In muscle, Toll-like 
receptor 4 (P = .03), TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β 
(P = .002), and oligosaccharyltransferase subunit 48 (P = .02) expression was 
lower in MHD than that in CON, whereas IL6 was higher (P = .01) and IL8 
(P = .08) tended to be higher in MHD.
CONCLUSION: Overall, MHD exhibited an exaggerated, circulating, and skeletal 
muscle inflammatory biomarker environment, and the meal did not appreciably 
affect the inflammatory status.

    medRxiv. 2021 Oct 14;:

Despite extraordinary international efforts to dampen the spread and understand 
the mechanisms behind SARS-CoV-2 infections, accessible predictive biomarkers 
directly applicable in the clinic are yet to be discovered. Recent studies have 
revealed that diverse types of assays bear limited predictive power for COVID-19 
outcomes. Here, we harness the predictive power of chest computed tomography 
(CT) in combination with plasma cytokines using a machine learning and k-fold 
cross-validation approach for predicting death during hospitalization and 
maximum severity degree in COVID-19 patients. Patients (n = 152) from the Mount 
Sinai Health System in New York with plasma cytokine assessment and a chest CT 
within five days from admission were included. Demographics, clinical, and 
laboratory variables, including plasma cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α), were 
collected from the electronic medical record. We found that CT quantitative 
alone was better at predicting severity (AUC 0.81) than death (AUC 0.70), while 
cytokine measurements alone better-predicted death (AUC 0.70) compared to

predictors of death (AUC 0.78) and maximum severity (AUC 0.82). Finally, we 
provide a simple scoring system (nomogram) using plasma IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, 
ground-glass opacities (GGO) to aerated lung ratio and age as new metrics that 
may be used to monitor patients upon hospitalization and help physicians make

Diamine Oxidase as a Therapeutic Enzyme: Study of Germination from Vegetal 
Sources and Investigation of the Presence of β-N-Oxalyl-L-α,β-diaminopropionic 
Acid (β-ODAP) Using LC-MS/MS.

TD(3), Ispas-Szabo P(1)(2), Sleno L(1), Mateescu MA(1)(2).

Vegetal diamine oxidase (vDAO), an enzyme proposed to relieve symptoms of 
histaminosis, shows better reactivity with histamine and aliphatic diamines, as 
well as higher enzymatic activity than DAO of animal origin. The objective of 
this study was to evaluate the enzyme activity of vDAO from germinating grains 
from Lathyrus sativus (grass pea) and Pisum sativum (pea), and to verify the 
presence of a neurotoxin, β-N-Oxalyl-L-α,β-diaminopropionic acid (β-ODAP), in 
the crude extract obtained from their seedlings. A targeted liquid 
chromatography-multiple-reaction monitoring mass spectrometry method was 
developed and used to quantify β-ODAP in the analysed extracts. An optimized 
sample preparation procedure, involving protein precipitation with acetonitrile 
followed by mixed-anion exchange solid-phase extraction, allowed for high 
sensitivity and good peak shape for β-ODAP detection. The Lathyrus sativus 
extract exhibited the highest vDAO enzyme activity of the extracts, followed by 
the extract from pea cultivar Amarillo from the Crop Development Centre (CDC). 
The results have also shown that even though β-ODAP was present in the crude 
extract from L. sativus, its content was far below the toxicity threshold (300 
mg of β-ODAP/kg body/day). CDC Amarillo showed 5000-fold less β-ODAP than the 
undialysed L. sativus extract. It was concluded that both species can be 
considered as convenient sources of vDAO for potential therapeutic use.

Daptomycin exerts differential immunomodulatory effects on host responses 
against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus biofilms.

Simitsopoulou M(1), Kadiltzoglou P(2), Antachopoulos C(2), Roilides E(3).

Daptomycin (DAP) is indicated for difficult-to-treat Gram-positive infections, 
especially those caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). 
Exposure of S. aureus to subinhibitory antimicrobial concentrations (sub-MICs) 
has been shown to alter cell morphology and biofilm formation. This study aimed 
to investigate the influence of DAP biofilm sub-MICs on the damage caused by 
human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) against MRSA biofilms and the 
potential immunomodulatory activity of DAP on human monocytes (MNCs) exposed to 
MRSA biofilms. DAP activity against biofilms and the impact of DAP on 
PMN-induced biofilm damage were evaluated by the XTT reduction assay, whereas 
pathogen recognition, signal transduction and cytokine modulation of DAP on MNCs 
in response to MRSA biofilms were assessed by RT-PCR and ELISA methodology. The 
MIC50 of DAP to MRSA biofilms was 16-32 mg/L. Pre-treatment of MRSA with 1, 2 or 
4 mg/L DAP caused a synergistic effect on PMN-mediated biofilm damage, being 
dependent on the effector-to-target ratio. MNCs responded to MRSA biofilms and 
DAP through Toll like receptor 2 (TLR2) upregulation and increased NLRP3 
inflammasome production. DAP caused 2.5-fold greater TLR2 mRNA levels than those 
caused by MRSA biofilms. A predominantly inflammatory response was induced by 
either component, causing the release of significantly increased IFN-γ, TNF-α, 
IL-8 and IL-6 levels by MNCs exposed to the combination treatment. MRSA biofilms 
alone or combined with DAP caused low amounts of IL-10 production, but increased 
IL-1β levels. DAP may condition MNCs towards an inflammatory response through 
TLR2 engagement and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, possibly controlling 
biofilm-associated pathogenicity.

Differential regulation of BIRC2 and BIRC3 expression by inflammatory cytokines 
and glucocorticoids in pulmonary epithelial cells.

Thorne A(1), Bansal A(1), Necker-Brown A(1), Mostafa MM(1), Gao A(1), Georgescu 
A(1), Kooi C(2), Leigh R(1)(2), Newton R(1).

Roles for the baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis repeat-containing (BIRC) genes, 
BIRC2 and BIRC3, may include signaling to the inflammatory transcription factor, 
nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and protection from cell death. However, distinct 
functions for each BIRC are not well-delineated. Given roles for the epithelium 
in barrier function and host defence, BIRC2 and BIRC3 expression was 
characterized in pulmonary epithelial cell lines and primary human bronchial 
epithelial cells (pHBECs) grown as undifferentiated cells in submersion culture 
(SC) or as highly differentiated cells at air-liquid interface (ALI). In A549 
cells, interleukin-1β (IL1B) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF) induced BIRC3 
mRNA (~20-50-fold), with maximal protein expression from 6-24 h. Similar effects 
occurred in BEAS-2B and Calu-3 cells, as well as SC and ALI pHBECs. BIRC2 
protein was readily detected in unstimulated cells, but was not markedly 
modulated by IL1B or TNF. Glucocorticoids (dexamethasone, budesonide) modestly 
increased BIRC3 mRNA and protein, but showed little effect on BIRC2 expression. 
In A549 cells, BIRC3 mRNA induced by IL1B was unchanged by glucocorticoids and 
showed supra-additivity with TNF-plus-glucocorticoid. Supra-additivity was also 
evident for IL1B-plus-budesonide induced-BIRC3 in SC and ALI pHBECs. Using A549 
cells, IL1B- and TNF-induced BIRC3 expression, and to a lesser extent, BIRC2, 
was prevented by NF-κB inhibition. Glucocorticoid-induced BIRC3 expression was 
prevented by silencing and antagonism of the glucocorticoid receptor. Whereas 
TNF, but not IL1B, induced degradation of basal BIRC2 and BIRC3 protein, IL1B- 
and TNF-induced BIRC3 protein remained stable. Differential regulation by 
cytokines and glucocorticoids shows BIRC2 protein expression to be consistent 
with roles in rapid signaling events, whereas cytokine-induced BIRC3 may be more 
important in later effects. While TNF-induced degradation of both BIRCs may 
restrict their activity, cytokine-enhanced BIRC3 expression could prime for its 
function. Finally, shielding from glucocorticoid repression, or further 
enhancement by glucocorticoid, may indicate a key protective role for BIRC3.

Atomic insights of an up and down conformation of the Acinetobacter baumannii 
F(1) -ATPase subunit ε and deciphering the residues critical for ATP hydrolysis 
inhibition and ATP synthesis.

Fong TC(1), Müller V(3), Grüber G(1).

The Acinetobacter baumannii F1 FO -ATP synthase (α3 :β3 :γ:δ:ε:a:b2 :c10 ), 
which is essential for this strictly respiratory opportunistic human pathogen, 
is incapable of ATP-driven proton translocation due to its latent ATPase 
activity. Here, we generated and purified the first recombinant A. baumannii F1 
-ATPase (AbF1 -ATPase) composed of subunits α3 :β3 :γ:ε, showing latent ATP 
hydrolysis. A 3.0 Å cryo-electron microscopy structure visualizes the 
architecture and regulatory element of this enzyme, in which the C-terminal 
domain of subunit ε (Abε) is present in an extended position. An ε-free AbF1 
-ɑβγ complex generated showed a 21.5-fold ATP hydrolysis increase, demonstrating 
that Abε is the major regulator of AbF1 -ATPase's latent ATP hydrolysis. The 
recombinant system enabled mutational studies of single amino acid substitutions 
within Abε or its interacting subunits β and γ, respectively, as well as 
C-terminal truncated mutants of Abε, providing a detailed picture of Abε's main 
element for the self-inhibition mechanism of ATP hydrolysis. Using a 
heterologous expression system, the importance of Abε's C-terminus in ATP 
synthesis of inverted membrane vesicles, including AbF1 FO -ATP synthases, has 
been explored. In addition, we are presenting the first NMR solution structure 
of the compact form of Abε, revealing interaction of its N-terminal β-barrel and 
C-terminal ɑ-hairpin domain. A double mutant of Abε highlights critical residues 
for Abε's domain-domain formation which is important also for AbF1 -ATPase's 
stability. Abε does not bind MgATP, which is described to regulate the up and 
down movements in other bacterial counterparts. The data are compared to 
regulatory elements of F1 -ATPases in bacteria, chloroplasts, and mitochondria 
to prevent wasting of ATP.

Increased Adipose Tissue Expression of IL-23 Associates with Inflammatory 
Markers in People with High LDL Cholesterol.

Koistinen HA(5)(6)(7), Al-Mulla F(8), Tuomilehto J(6)(9), Ahmad R(1).

Chronic low-grade inflammation induced by obesity is a central risk factor for 
the development of metabolic syndrome. High low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(LDL-c) induces inflammation, which is a common denominator in metabolic 
syndrome. IL-23 plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of 
meta-inflammatory diseases; however, its relationship with LDL-c remains 
elusive. In this cross-sectional study, we determined whether the adipose tissue 
IL-23 expression was associated with other inflammatory mediators in people with 
increased plasma LDL-c concentrations. Subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies were 
collected from 60 people, sub-divided into two groups based on their plasma 
LDL-c concentrations (<2.9 and ≥2.9 mmol/L). Adipose expression of IL-23 and 
inflammatory markers were determined using real-time qRT-PCR; plasma 
concentrations of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) and LDL-c were determined using the standard 
method; and adiponectin levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA). Adipose IL-23 transcripts were found to be increased in people 
with high LDL-c, compared to low LDL-c group (H-LDL-c: 1.63 ± 0.10-Fold; 
L-LDL-c: 1.27 ± 0.09-Fold; p < 0.01); IL-23 correlated positively with LDL-c (r 
= 0.471, p < 0.0001). Immunochemistry analysis showed that AT IL-23 protein 
expression was also elevated in the people with H-LDL-c. IL-23 expression in the 
high LDL-c group was associated with multiple adipose inflammatory biomarkers (p 
≤ 0.05), including macrophage markers (CD11c, CD68, CD86, CD127), TLRs (TLR8, 
TLR10), IRF3, pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-12, IL-18), and chemokines 
(CXCL8, CCL3, CCL5, CCL15, CCL20). Notably, in this cohort, IL-23 expression 
correlated inversely with plasma adiponectin. In conclusion, adipose IL-23 may 
be an inflammatory biomarker for disease progression in people with high LDL-c.

Previous studies have not completely elucidated the role of the histaminergic 
system in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. This study aimed to evaluate the 
effects of adalimumab and cyclosporine A on the expression of histaminergic 
system-related genes and miRNAs regulating these genes in bacterial 
lipopolysaccharide A (LPS)-stimulated human keratinocyte (HaCaT) cells. HaCaT 
cells were treated with 1 µg/mL LPS for 8 h, followed by treatment with 8 µg/mL 
adalimumab or 100 ng/mL cyclosporine A for 2, 8, or 24 h. Untreated cells served 
as controls. The cells were subjected to ribonucleic acid (RNA) extraction and 
microarray, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay analyses. Statistical analysis was performed using the 
Statistica 13.0 PL (StatSoft, Cracow, Poland) and the Transcriptome Analysis 
Console programs (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) (p < 0.05). The differential 
expression of the following two miRNAs was not affected in LPS-stimulated cells 
upon treatment with cyclosporine A or adalimumab: hsa-miR-583 (downregulated 
expression), involved in the regulation of histamine receptor 1 - HRH1 
(overexpression); has-miR-1275 (downregulated expression), involved in the 
regulation of histamine receptor 1 - HRH3 (overexpression) and Solute carrier 
family 22 member 3 - SLC23A2 (downregulated expression)). Adalimumab and 
cyclosporine A modulated the histaminergic system in HaCaT cells in vitro.

The Mobility of the Cap Domain Is Essential for the Substrate Promiscuity of a 
Family IV Esterase from Sorghum Rhizosphere Microbiome.

Metagenomics offers the possibility to screen for versatile biocatalysts. In 
this study, the microbial community of the Sorghum bicolor rhizosphere was 
spiked with technical cashew nut shell liquid, and after incubation, the 
environmental DNA (eDNA) was extracted and subsequently used to build a 
metagenomic library. We report the biochemical features and crystal structure of 
a novel esterase from the family IV, EH0, retrieved from an uncultured 
sphingomonad after a functional screen in tributyrin agar plates. EH0 (optimum 
temperature [Topt], 50°C; melting temperature [Tm], 55.7°C; optimum pH [pHopt], 
9.5) was stable in the presence of 10 to 20% (vol/vol) organic solvents and 
exhibited hydrolytic activity against p-nitrophenyl esters from acetate to 
palmitate, preferably butyrate (496 U mg-1), and a large battery of 69 
structurally different esters (up to 30.2 U mg-1), including 
bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-terephthalate (0.16 ± 0.06 U mg-1). This broad substrate 
specificity contrasts with the fact that EH0 showed a long and narrow catalytic 
tunnel, whose access appears to be hindered by a tight folding of its cap 
domain. We propose that this cap domain is a highly flexible structure whose 
opening is mediated by unique structural elements, one of which is the presence 
of two contiguous proline residues likely acting as possible hinges, which 
together allow for the entrance of the substrates. Therefore, this work provides 
a new role for the cap domain, which until now was thought to be an immobile 
element that contained hydrophobic patches involved in substrate prerecognition 
and in turn substrate specificity within family IV esterases. IMPORTANCE A 
better understanding of structure-function relationships of enzymes allows 
revelation of key structural motifs or elements. Here, we studied the structural 
basis of the substrate promiscuity of EH0, a family IV esterase, isolated from a 
sample of the Sorghum bicolor rhizosphere microbiome exposed to technical cashew 
nut shell liquid. The analysis of EH0 revealed the potential of the sorghum 
rhizosphere microbiome as a source of enzymes with interesting properties, such 
as pH and solvent tolerance and remarkably broad substrate promiscuity. Its 
structure resembled those of homologous proteins from mesophilic Parvibaculum 
and Erythrobacter spp. and hyperthermophilic Pyrobaculum and Sulfolobus spp. and 
had a very narrow, single-entry access tunnel to the active site, with access 
controlled by a capping domain that includes a number of nonconserved proline 
residues. These structural markers, distinct from those of other 
substrate-promiscuous esterases, can help in tuning substrate profiles beyond 
tunnel and active site engineering.

Soluble and cell-based markers of immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated 
nephritis.

RN(3), Rosales IA(3), Colvin RB(3), Chute S(2), Cornell LD(4), Herrmann SM(5), 
Fadden R(6), Sullivan RJ(6), Yang NJ(7), Barmettler S(7), Wells S(8), Gupta 
S(8)(9), Villani AC(6), Reynolds KL(6), Farmer J(10).

BACKGROUND: Non-invasive biomarkers of immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated 
acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (ICI-nephritis) are urgently needed. Because 
ICIs block immune checkpoint pathways that include cytotoxic T lymphocyte 
antigen 4 (CTLA4), we hypothesized that biomarkers of immune 
dysregulationpreviously defined in patients with congenital CTLA4 deficiency, 
including elevated soluble interleukin-2 receptor alpha (sIL-2R) and flow 
cytometric cell-based markers of B and T cell dysregulation in peripheral blood 
may aid the diagnosis of ICI-nephritis.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort of patients diagnosed with ICI-nephritis was 
compared with three prospectively enrolled control cohorts: ICI-treated controls 
without immune-related adverse events, patients not on ICIs with hemodynamic 
acute kidney injury (hemodynamic AKI), and patients not on ICIs with biopsy 
proven acute interstitial nephritis from other causes (non-ICI-nephritis). 
sIL-2R level and flow cytometric parameters were compared between groups using 
Wilcoxon rank sum test or Kruskal-Wallis test. Receiver operating characteristic 
curves were generated to define the accuracy of sIL-2R and flow cytometric 
biomarkers in diagnosing ICI-nephritis. The downstream impact of T cell 
activation in the affected kidney was investigated using archived biopsy samples 
to evaluate the gene expression of IL2RA, IL-2 signaling, and T cell receptor 
signaling in patients with ICI-nephritis compared with other causes of 
drug-induced nephritis, acute tubular injury, and histologically normal 
controls.
RESULTS: sIL-2R level in peripheral blood was significantly higher in patients 
with ICI-nephritis (N=24) (median 2.5-fold upper limit of normal (ULN), IQR 
1.9-3.3), compared with ICI-treated controls (N=10) (median 0.8-fold ULN, IQR 
0.5-0.9, p<0.001) and hemodynamic AKI controls (N=6) (median 0.9-fold-ULN, IQR 
0.7-1.1, p=0.008). A sIL-2R cut-off point of 1.75-fold ULN was highly diagnostic 
of ICI-nephritis (area under the curve >96%) when compared with either 
ICI-treated or hemodynamic AKI controls. By peripheral blood flow cytometry 
analysis, lower absolute CD8+T cells, CD45RA+CD8+ T cells, memory CD27+B cells, 
and expansion of plasmablasts were prominent features of ICI-nephritis compared 
with ICI-treated controls. Gene expressions for IL2RA, IL-2 signaling, and T 
cell receptor signaling in the kidney tissue with ICI-nephritis were 
significantly higher compared with controls.
CONCLUSION: Elevated sIL-2R level and flow cytometric markers of both B and T 
cell dysregulation may aid the diagnosis of ICI-nephritis.

Crystal structure of the 3-ketodihydrosphingosine reductase TSC10 from 
Cryptococcus neoformans.

Zhao P(1), Zhuang Z(1), Guan X(1), Yang J(1), Wang W(2), Kuang Z(3).

The second step in the de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis is the reduction of 
3-ketodihydrosphingosine by 3-ketodihydrosphingosine reductase (KDSR) to produce 
dihydrosphingosine (sphinganine). Fungal TSC10 and mammalian KDSR (also named 
FVT-1) proteins are the enzymes responsible for this process and they belong to 
the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily. Albeit that both 
fungal and mammalian 3-ketodihydrosphingosine reductases were identified more 
than a decade ago, no structure of these enzymes from any species has been 
experimentally determined. Here we report the crystal structure of the catalytic 
domain of TSC10 from Cryptococcus neoformans in complex with NADPH. cnTSC10 
adopts a Rossmann fold with a central seven-stranded β-sheet flanked by 
α-helices on both sides. Several regions are disordered that include the segment 
connecting the serine and tyrosine residues of the catalytic triad, the 
so-called 'substrate loop', and the C-terminal region that often participates in 
homo-tetramerization in other SDRs. In addition, the cofactor NADPH is not fully 
ordered. These structural features indicate that the catalytic site of cnTSC10 
possesses significant flexibility. cnTSC10 is predominantly dimeric in solution 
while a minor portion of the protein forms homo-tetramer. The crystal structure 
reveals that the homo-dimer interface involves both hydrophobic and hydrophilic 
interactions mediated by helices α4 and α5, as well as the loop connecting 
strand β4 and helix α4. Because residues forming hydrogen bonds and salt bridges 
in the dimer interface are not conserved between fungal TSC10 and mammalian KDSR 
proteins, it might be possible to develop inhibitors that selectively target 
fungal TSC10 dimerization.

Crystal structure of the apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease XthA (HP1526 
protein) from Helicobacter pylori.

Dinh T(1), Dao O(1), Killivalavan A(2), Ngo D(1), Lee KH(3).

Helicobacter pylori is a bacterium that causes gastritis, peptic ulcer disease 
and adenocarcinoma while infecting human stomach. In the stomach H. pylori is 
under stresses caused by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species from host immune 
response, which causes oxidative DNA damage. The DNA damage in single base is 
repaired by base excision repair (BER) and/or nucleotide incision repair (NIR) 
pathways. H. pylori retains a minimal set of enzymes involved in the BER and NIR 
pathways. The HP1526 protein is a single apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease 
homologous to E. coli Xth protein but little is known for its structure up to 
now. In this study, the structure of the recombinant HP1526 protein from 
H. pylori (HpXthA) has been determined at a high resolution of 1.84 Å. From the 
structural analysis the HpXthA was found to belong to the Xth-like AP 
endonuclease family carrying the common fold of a central bilayer β-sheet 
flanked by α-helices with a divalent metal ion bound. A Mn2+ ion and a 
1,3-butanediol were unusually found and modeled around the active site. 
Structural and sequence comparisons among the AP endonucleases show 
well-conserved residues for metal and DNA binding and for catalysis. 
Interestingly, the presence of a small polar residue Ser201 of the HpXthA 
commonly found in NIR-proficient AP endonucleases instead of an aspartate 
residue in NIR-deficient enzymes suggests that the HpXthA retain a nucleotide 
incision repair activity.

A splicing variant of EDS1 from Vitis vinifera forms homodimers but no 
heterodimers with PAD4.

Voss M(1), Cseke LJ(2), Gassmann W(2), Niefind K(1).

Enhanced Disease Susceptibility 1 (EDS1), a key component of microbe-triggered 
immunity and effector-triggered immunity in most higher plants, forms functional 
heterodimeric complexes with its homologs Phytoalexin Deficient 4 (PAD4) or 
Senescence-associated Gene 101 (SAG101). Here, the crystal structure of 
VvEDS1Nterm , the N-terminal domain of EDS1 from Vitis vinifera, is reported, 
representing the first structure of an EDS1 entity beyond the model plant 
Arabidopsis thaliana. VvEDS1Nterm has an α/β-hydrolase fold, is similar to the 
N-terminal domain of A. thaliana EDS1 and forms stable homodimers in solution as 
well as in crystals. These VvEDS1Nterm homodimers are spatially incompatible 
with heterodimers with PAD4 or SAG101, they explain why VvEDS1Nterm does not 
interact with V. vinifera PAD4 according to gel filtration, and they serve as a 
guide to develop a plausible, albeit experimentally not verified model of 
full-length EDS1. VvEDS1Nterm is a splicing variant comprising two of three 
exons of the VvEDS1 gene. It originates from a naturally occurring mRNA, in 
which the first of two introns was removed while the second one containing a 
stop codon close to the exon/intron border was retained. This is a potential 
case of intron retention and the first report of this phenomenon in the context 
of EDS1. Its biological significance has not yet been clarified, nor has the 
question if a VvEDS1Nterm protein with a specific function can occur under 
physiological conditions.

New Insights into the Inhibition of Hesperetin on Polyphenol Oxidase: Inhibitory 
Kinetics, Binding Characteristics, Conformational Change and Computational 
Simulation.

Hong X(1), Luo X(1), Wang L(1)(2), Gong D(1), Zhang G(1).

The inhibitory activity of hesperetin on polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and their 
interaction characteristics were investigated using multiple spectroscopic 
methods and computational simulation. Hesperetin, a mixed inhibitor, reversibly 
inhibited PPO activity, and its half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) 
values on monophenolase and diphenolase were 80.8 ± 1.4 μM and 776.0 ± 15.5 μM, 
respectively. Multivariate curve resolution-alternate least squares (MCR-ALS) 
analysis suggested PPO interacted with hesperetin and formed PPO-hesperetin 
complex. Hesperetin statically quenched PPO's endogenous fluorescence, and 
hydrophobic interactions mainly drove their binding. Hesperetin affected the 
polarity of the microenvironment around the Trp residues in PPO, but had no 
effect on that around Tyr residues. Circular dichroism (CD) results showed that 
hesperetin increased α-helix content and decreased β-fold and random coil 
contents, thus tightening PPO's structure. Molecular docking showed that 
hesperetin entered the hydrophobic cavity of PPO, bound near the dinuclear 
copper active center, interacted with Val283, Phe264, His85, Asn260, Val248, and 
His263 via hydrophobic interactions, formed hydrogen bonds with Met280, His89, 
and His259 residues and also interacted with Phe292, His61, Phe90, Glu256, 
His244, Asn260, Phe264, and Gly281 via van der Waals forces. The molecular 
dynamics simulation results also demonstrated that the addition of hesperetin 
reduced the stability and hydrophobicity of PPO and increased PPO's structural 
denseness. Thus, the inhibition of hesperetin on PPO may be because hesperetin 
bound near the active center of PPO, interacted with the surrounding residues, 
occupied the binding site for substrate, and induced the changes in PPO's 
secondary structure, thus inhibiting the catalytic activity of PPO. This study 
may provide novel views for the inhibition of hesperetin on PPO and theoretical 
guidance for developing flavonoids as new and efficient PPO inhibitors.

Organosulfur Compounds in Aged Garlic Extract Ameliorate Glucose Induced 
Diabetic Cardiomyopathy by Attenuating Oxidative Stress, Cardiac Fibrosis, and 
Cardiac Apoptosis.

Rani V(1), Sharma K(1).

BACKGROUND: Diabetic cardiomyopathy has emerged as a major cause of cardiac 
fibrosis, hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, and heart failure due to 
uncontrolled glucose metabolism in patients with diabetes mellitus. However, 
there is still no consensus on the optimal treatment to prevent or treat the 
cardiac burden associated with diabetes, which urges the development of dual 
antidiabetic and cardioprotective cardiac therapy based on natural products. 
This study investigates the cardiotoxic profile of glucose and the efficacy of 
AGE against glucose-induced cardiotoxicity in H9c2 cardiomyocytes.
MATERIAL METHODS: The cellular metabolic activity of H9c2 cardiomyocytes under 
increasing glucose concentration and the therapeutic efficacy of AGE were 
investigated using the MTT cell cytotoxicity assay. The in vitro model was 
established in six groups known as 1. control, 2. cells treated with 25 µM 
glucose, 3. 100 µM glucose, 4. 25 µM glucose +35 µM AGE, 5. 100 µM glucose + 35 
µM AGE, and 6. 35 µM AGE. Morphological and nuclear analyses were performed 
using Giemsa, HE, DAPI, and PI, respectively, whereas cell death was 
simultaneously assessed using the trypan blue assay. The antioxidant potential 
of AGE was evaluated by DCFH-DA assay, NO, and H202 scavenging assay. The 
activities of the antioxidant enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase were 
also investigated. The antiglycative potential of AGE was examined by 
antiglycation assays, amylase zymography, and SDS PAGE. These results were then 
validated by in silico molecular docking and qRTPCR.
RESULTS: Hyperglycemia significantly reduced cellular metabolic activity of H9c2 
cardiomyocytes, and AGE was found to preserve cell viability approximately 
2-fold by attenuating oxidative, fibrosis, and apoptotic signaling molecules. In 
silico and qRTPCR studies confirmed that organosulfur compounds target TNF-α, 
MAPK, TGF-β, MMP-7, and caspase-9 signaling molecules to ameliorate 
glucose-induced cardiotoxicity.
CONCLUSION: AGE was found to be an antidiabetic and cardioprotective natural 
product with exceptional therapeutic potential for use as a novel herb-drug 
therapy in the treatment of diabetic cardiomyopathy in future therapies.

De novo tryptophanase-based indole production by metabolically engineered 
Corynebacterium glutamicum.

Mindt M(#)(1)(2), Ferrer L(#)(3)(4), Bosch D(1), Cankar K(5), Wendisch VF(6).

Indole has an increasing interest in the flavor and fragrance industry. It is 
used in dairy products, tea drinks, and fine fragrances due to its distinct 
floral odor typical of jasmine blossoms. The current production of indole based 
on isolation from coal tar is non-sustainable and its isolation from plants is 
often unprofitable due to low yields. To offer an alternative to the 
conventional production, biosynthesis of indole has been studied recently. A 
glucose-based indole production was achieved by employing the Corynebacterium 
glutamicum tryptophan synthase α-subunit (TrpA) or indole-3-glycerol phosphate 
lyase (IGL) from wheat Triticum aestivum in a genetically-engineered C. 
glutamicum strain. In addition, a highly efficient bioconversion process using 
C. glutamicum heterologously expressing tryptophanase gene (tnaA) from 
Providencia rettgeri as a biocatalyst was developed. In this work, de novo 
indole production from glucose was enabled by expressing the P. rettgeri tnaA in 
a tryptophan-producing C. glutamicum strain. By metabolic engineering of a C. 
glutamicum shikimate accumulating base strain, tryptophan production of 2.14 ± 
0.02 g L-1 was achieved. Introduction of the tryptophanase form P. rettgeri 
enabled indole production, but to low titers, which could be improved by 
sequestering indole into the water-immiscible solvent tributyrin during 
fermentation and a titer of 1.38 ± 0.04 g L-1 was achieved. The process was 
accelerated by decoupling growth from production increasing the volumetric 
productivity about 4-fold to 0.08 g L-1 h-1. KEY POINTS: • Efficient de novo 
indole production via tryptophanases from glucose • Increased indole titers by 
product sequestration and improved precursor supply • Decoupling growth from 
production accelerated indole production.

sub-period sleep stages.

Gao L(1), Yang Q(2), Zhang B(3), Lu S(3)(4), Tang J(3)(4), Leng J(1).

BACKGROUND: As a medium for developing brain-computer interface systems, EEG 
signals are complex and difficult to identify due to their complexity, weakness, 
and differences between subjects. At present, most of the current research on 
sleep EEG signals are single-channel and dual-channel, ignoring the research on 
the relationship between different brain regions. Brain functional connectivity 
is considered to be closely related to brain activity and can be used to study 
the interaction relationship between brain areas.
METHODS: Phase-locked value (PLV) is used to construct a functional connection 
network. The connection network is used to analyze the connection mechanism and 
brain interaction in different sleep stages. Firstly, the entire EEG signal is 
divided into multiple sub-periods. Secondly, Phase-locked value is used for 
feature extraction on the sub-periods. Thirdly, the PLV of multiple sub-periods 
is used for feature fusion. Fourthly, the classification performance 
optimization strategy is used to discuss the impact of different frequency bands 
on sleep stage classification performance and to find the optimal frequency 
band. Finally, the brain function network is constructed by using the average 
value of the fusion features to analyze the interaction of brain regions in 
different frequency bands during sleep stages.
RESULTS: The experimental results have shown that when the number of sub-periods 
is 30, the α (8-13 Hz) frequency band has the best classification effect, The 
classification result after 10-fold cross-validation reaches 92.59%.
CONCLUSION: The proposed algorithm has good sleep staging performance, which can 
effectively promote the development and application of an EEG sleep staging 
system.

SARS-CoV-2 humoral and cellular immunity following different combinations of 
vaccination and breakthrough infection.

Pušnik J(1)(2), Monzon-Posadas WO(1)(2)(3), Zorn J(1)(2), Peters K(1)(2), Baum 
M(1)(2), Proksch H(1)(2), Schlüter CB(1)(2), Alter G(4), Menting T(3), Streeck 
H(5)(6).

The elicited anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity is becoming increasingly complex with 
individuals receiving a different number of vaccine doses paired with or without 
recovery from breakthrough infections with different variants. Here we analyze 
the immunity of individuals that initially received two doses of mRNA vaccine 
and either received a booster vaccination, recovered from a breakthrough 
infection, or both. Our data suggest that two vaccine doses and delta 
breakthrough infection or three vaccine doses and optionally omicron or delta 
infection provide better B cell immunity than the initial two doses of mRNA 
vaccine with or without alpha breakthrough infection. A particularly potent B 
cell response against the currently circulating omicron variant (B. 1.1.529) was 
observed for thrice vaccinated individuals with omicron breakthrough infection; 
a 46-fold increase in plasma neutralization compared to two vaccine doses 
(p < 0.0001). The T cell response after two vaccine doses is not significantly 
influenced by additional antigen exposures. Of note, individuals with hybrid 
immunity show better correlated adaptive immune responses compared to those only 
vaccinated. Taken together, our data provide a detailed insight into SARS-CoV-2 
immunity following different antigen exposure scenarios.

Structural and functional analysis of a tandem repeat galacturonic acid-binding 
lectin from the sea hare Aplysia californica.

Silva-Becerril A(1), Quintero-Martínez A(1), Hernández-Santoyo A(2).

A d-galacturonic acid-specific lectin, named AcL, was purified from the sea hare 
Aplysia californica by galactose-agarose affinity chromatography. AcL has a 
molecular mass of 27.5 kDa determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. This 
lectin shows a good affinity for d-galacturonic acid and a lower affinity for 
galactosides: raffinose, melibiose, α and β-lactose, and d-galactose. We 
determined the amino acid sequence of AcL by trypsin digestion and subsequent 
peptide analysis by mass spectrometry, resulting in a 238 amino acid protein 
with a theoretical molecular mass of 26.4 kDa. The difference between the 
theoretical and experimental values can be attributed to post-translational 
modifications. Thiol-disulfide quantification discerned five disulfide bonds and 
three free cysteines. The structure of Acl is mainly comprised of beta sheets, 
determined by circular dichroism, and predicted with AlphaFold. Theoretical 
models depict three nearly identical tandem domains consisting of two beta 
sheets each. From docking analysis, we identified AcL glycan-binding sites as 
multiple conserved motifs in each domain. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis 
based on its structure and sequence showed that AcL and its closest homologues 
(GalULs) form a clear monophyletic group, distinct from other glycan-binding 
proteins with a jelly-roll fold: lectins of types F and H. GalULs possess four 
conserved sequence regions that distinguish them and are either ligand-binding 
motifs or stabilizing network hubs. We suggest that this new family should be 
referred to as GalUL or D-type, following the traditional naming of lectins; D 
standing for depilans, the epithet for the species (Aplysia depilans) from which 
a lectin of this family was first isolated and described.

Evaluation of Rapid Lateral-Flow Tests Directed against the SARS-CoV-2 
Nucleoprotein Using Viral Suspensions Belonging to Different Lineages of 
SARS-CoV-2.

Pillet S(1)(2), Courtieux J(1), Gonzalo S(1), Bechri I(1), Bourlet T(1)(2), 
Valette M(3), Bal A(3), Pozzetto B(1)(2).

Within the successive waves that occurred during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, 
recommendations arose to test symptomatic and contact subjects by using rapid 
antigen devices directed against the viral nucleocapsid protein with the aim to 
isolate contagious patients without delay. The objective of this study was to 
evaluate the ability of four rapid lateral-flow tests (RLFT) that were 
commercially available on the French market in 2022 to recognize various strains 
of SARS-CoV-2. Series of five-fold dilutions of seven viral suspensions 
belonging to different lineages of SARS-CoV-2 (19A, 20A, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, 
Delta and Omicron) were used to evaluate the analytical sensitivity of four 
commercially available RLFTs (manufacturers: Abbott, AAZ, Becton-Dickinson and 
Biospeedia). Cell culture and quantitative RT-PCR were used as references. 
Excellent correlations were observed for each lineage strain between the viral 
titer obtained via cell culture and the number of RNA copies measured by 
quantitative RT-PCR. Although the four tests were able to recognize all the 
tested variants, significant differences in terms of sensitivity were observed 
between the four RLFTs. Despite the limitation represented by the small number 
of devices and clinical isolates that were tested, this study contributed by 
rapidly comparing the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RLFTs in the Omicron era.

Structural Insights into the Dimeric Form of Bacillus subtilis RNase Y Using NMR 
and AlphaFold.

Morellet N(1), Hardouin P(2), Assrir N(1), van Heijenoort C(1), 
Golinelli-Pimpaneau B(2).

RNase Y is a crucial component of genetic translation, acting as the key enzyme 
initiating mRNA decay in many Gram-positive bacteria. The N-terminal domain of 
Bacillus subtilis RNase Y (Nter-BsRNaseY) is thought to interact with various 
protein partners within a degradosome complex. Bioinformatics and biophysical 
analysis have previously shown that Nter-BsRNaseY, which is in equilibrium 
between a monomeric and a dimeric form, displays an elongated fold with a high 
content of α-helices. Using multidimensional heteronuclear NMR and AlphaFold 
models, here, we show that the Nter-BsRNaseY dimer is constituted of a long 
N-terminal parallel coiled-coil structure, linked by a turn to a C-terminal 
region composed of helices that display either a straight or bent conformation. 
The structural organization of the N-terminal domain is maintained within the 
AlphaFold model of the full-length RNase Y, with the turn allowing flexibility 
between the N- and C-terminal domains. The catalytic domain is globular, with 
two helices linking the KH and HD modules, followed by the C-terminal region. 
This latter region, with no function assigned up to now, is most likely involved 
in the dimerization of B. subtilis RNase Y together with the N-terminal 
coiled-coil structure.

Validation of Selective Capture of Fimbriated Uropathogenic Escherichia coli by 
a Label-free Engineering Detection System Using Mannosylated Surfaces.

Mousavifar L(1), Parreira P(2)(3), Taponard A(1), Graça VCD(3), Martins 
MCL(2)(3)(4), Roy R(1).

Label-free detection of pathogens is of major concern to the microbiologist 
community. Most procedures require several steps and amplification techniques. 
Carbohydrates are well-established receptors for host-pathogen interactions, 
which can be amplified using glycodendritic architectures on the basis of 
multivalent binding interactions. Given that uropathogenic Escherichia coli 
bacterial FimH is based on such mannopyranoside-binding interactions, we 
demonstrate herein that synthetic monomeric and trimeric thiolated 
α-d-mannosides can be effectively bound to gold substrate-functionalized 
self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) preactivated with maleimide functionalities. 
Mannosides grafted onto SAMs were followed using Quartz Crystal Microbalance 
with Dissipation (QCM-D). Binding recognition efficiency was first evaluated 
using the plant lectin from Canavalia ensiformis (ConA) also using QCM-D. We 
showed a direct correlation between the amount of mannoside bound and the lectin 
attachment. Even though there was less trimer bound (nM/cm2) to the surface, we 
observed a 7-fold higher amount of lectin anchoring, thus further demonstrating 
the value of the multivalent interactions. We next examined the relative 
fimbriated E. coli selective adhesion/capture to either the monomeric or the 
trimeric mannoside bound to the surface. Our results established the successful 
engineering of the surfaces to show E. coli adhesion via specific 
mannopyranoside binding but unexpectedly, the monomeric derivative was more 
efficient than the trimeric analog, which could be explained by steric 
hindrance. This approach strongly suggests that it could be broadly applicable 
to other Gram-negative bacteria sharing analogous carbohydrate-dependent binding 
interactions.

Inverse agonist efficacy of selatogrel blunts constitutive P2Y12 receptor 
signaling by inducing the inactive receptor conformation.

Pons V(1), Garcia C(2), Tidten-Luksch N(3), Mac Sweeney A(4), Caroff E(3), Galés 
C(1), Riederer MA(5).

Selatogrel is a potent inhibitor of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) binding to the 
P2Y12 receptor, preventing platelet activation. We have previously shown that 
the P2Y12 receptor constitutively activates Gi- and Go-protein-mediated 
signaling in human platelets. Here, we report that selatogrel acts as an inverse 
agonist of the P2Y12 receptor. Specifically, using bioluminescence resonance 
energy transfer2 (BRET2) probes, selatogrel, ticagrelor, and elinogrel were 
shown to stabilize the inactive form of the Gαi/o-Gβγ complex in cells with 
recombinant expression of the P2Y12 receptor. In dose-response experiments, 
while selatogrel exhibited a maximal efficacy similar to ticagrelor, selatogrel 
was approximately 100-fold more potent than ticagrelor. Quantification of 
relative cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels in cells expressing the 
cAMP BRET1 sensor (CAMYEL probe) confirmed that selatogrel completely abolished 
the constitutive activity of the P2Y12 receptor. In agreement, selatogrel 
increased basal cAMP levels in human platelets, confirming inverse agonism on 
the endogenous human platelet P2Y12 receptor. In agreement with the biochemical 
phenotype of inverse agonism efficacy of selatogrel, the 2.8 Angstrom resolution 
cocrystal structure of selatogrel bound to the P2Y12 receptor confirmed that 
selatogrel stabilizes the inactive, basal state of the receptor. Selatogrel 
bound to pocket 1, spanning helix III to VII. Furthermore, the binding mode of 
selatogrel, suggesting steric overlap with the proposed binding site of ADP and 
the ADP analog 2-methylthioadenosine diphosphate (2MeSADP), agrees with the 
functional characterization of selatogrel preventing platelet activation by 
blocking ADP binding to the P2Y12 receptor.

Effect of intermittency factor on singlet oxygen and PGE(2) formation in 
azulene-mediated photodynamic therapy: A preliminary study.

Teerakapong A(3)(4), Meesawat K(5), Kruesubthaworn A(5), Ruangsuwan C(6), 
Weera-Archakul W(7).

In photodynamic therapy, intermittent irradiation modes that incorporate an 
interval between pulses are believed to decrease the effect of hypoxia by 
permitting an interval of re-oxygenation. The effect of the irradiation 
intermittency factor (the ratio of the irradiation pulse time to the total 
irradiation time) on singlet oxygen formation and inflammatory cytokine 
production was examined using azulene as a photosensitizer. Effects of 
difference intermittency factor on singlet oxygen formation and inflammatory 
cytokine were examined. Azulene solutions (1/10 μM) were irradiated with a 
638-nm 500 mW diode laser in fractionation (intermittency factor of 5 or 9) or 
continuous mode using 50 mW/cm2 at 4 or 8 J/cm2. Singlet oxygen measurement was 
performed using a dimethyl anthracene probe. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMC) were stimulated by 10 ng/ml rhTNF-α for 6 h, before addition of 1 and 
10 μM azulene solutions and irradiation. PGE2 measurement was undertaken using a 
human PGE2 ELISA kit. Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn Bonferroni test was used for 
statistical analyses at p < 0.05.Irradiation of 1 μM 
azulene+4 J/cm2+intermittency factor of 9 increased singlet oxygen 3-fold 
(p < 0.0001). Irradiation of 10 μM azulene at either 4 J/cm2+intermittency of 9 
or 8 J/cm2+intermittency factor of 5 reduced PGE2 expression in PBMCs to 
non-inflamed levels. Thus, at 50 mW/cm2, 10 μM azulene-mediated photodynamic 
therapy with a high intermittency factor and a low energy density generated 
sufficient singlet oxygen to suppress PGE2 in Inflamed PBMCs.

Using multiple convolutional window scanning of convolutional neural network for 
an efficient prediction of ATP-binding sites in transport proteins.

Nguyen TT(1), Chen S(1), Ho QT(1), Ou YY(1).

Protein multiple sequence alignment information has long been important features 
to know about functions of proteins inferred from related sequences with known 
functions. It is therefore one of the underlying ideas of Alpha fold 2, a 
breakthrough study and model for the prediction of three-dimensional structures 
of proteins from their primary sequence. Our study used protein multiple 
sequence alignment information in the form of position-specific scoring matrices 
as input. We also refined the use of a convolutional neural network, a 
well-known deep-learning architecture with impressive achievement on image and 
image-like data. Specifically, we revisited the study of prediction of adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP)-binding sites with more efficient convolutional neural 
networks. We applied multiple convolutional window scanning filters of a 
convolutional neural network on position-specific scoring matrices for as much 
as useful information as possible. Furthermore, only the most specific motifs 
are retained at each feature map output through the one-max pooling layer before 
going to the next layer. We assumed that this way could help us retain the most 
conserved motifs which are discriminative information for prediction. Our 
experiment results show that a convolutional neural network with not too many 
convolutional layers can be enough to extract the conserved information of 
proteins, which leads to higher performance. Our best prediction models were 
obtained after examining them with different hyper-parameters. Our experiment 
results showed that our models were superior to traditional use of convolutional 
neural networks on the same datasets as well as other machine-learning 
classification algorithms.

PF-431396 hydrate inhibition of kinase phosphorylation during adherent-invasive 
Escherichia coli infection inhibits intra-macrophage replication and 
inflammatory cytokine release.

Li X(1), Ormsby MJ(1)(2), Fallata G(1)(3), Meikle LM(1), Walker D(4), Xu 
D(1)(5), Wall DM(1).

Adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) have been implicated in the aetiology 
of Crohn's disease (CD). They are characterized by an ability to adhere to and 
invade intestinal epithelial cells, and to replicate intracellularly in 
macrophages resulting in inflammation. Proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2) has 
previously been identified as a risk locus for inflammatory bowel disease and a 
regulator of intestinal inflammation. It is overexpressed in patients with 
colorectal cancer, a major long-term complication of CD. Here we show that Pyk2 
levels are significantly increased during AIEC infection of murine macrophages 
while the inhibitor PF-431396 hydrate, which blocks Pyk2 activation, 
significantly decreased intramacrophage AIEC numbers. Imaging flow cytometry 
indicated that Pyk2 inhibition blocked intramacrophage replication of AIEC with 
no change in the overall number of infected cells, but a significant reduction 
in bacterial burden per cell. This reduction in intracellular bacteria resulted 
in a 20-fold decrease in tumour necrosis factor α secretion by cells post-AIEC 
infection. These data demonstrate a key role for Pyk2 in modulating AIEC 
intracellular replication and associated inflammation and may provide a new 
avenue for future therapeutic intervention in CD.

Elastin-targeted nanoparticles delivering doxycycline mitigate cytokine storm 
and reduce immune cell infiltration in LPS-mediated lung inflammation.

Arora S(1), Vyavahare N(1).

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cytokine storm invoked during acute and chronic lung 
injury promotes alveolar damage and remodeling. The current study shows that 
degraded elastin-targeted nanoparticles releasing doxycycline (Doxy NPs) are 
potent in mitigating cytokines storm, migration of immune cells in the lungs, 
and inhibiting inflammasome pathways in the LPS mouse model.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Cytokine storm and lung injury were induced using LPS and 
elastase in C57BL/6 mice (rodent model for emphysema). The mice were then 
treated with I.V. Doxy NPs, blank NPs, or Doxy a day before LPS administration. 
Cytokine levels, immune cell population, and MMP activity were analyzed in 
broncheo-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) 4 hours after LPS administration. 
Additionally, gene expression of IL-6, IL-1beta, MCP-1, NLRP3, Caspase 1 and 
MMPs were investigated in alveolar cells on day 3 after LPS administration.
KEY RESULTS: Doxycycline NPs but not Doxycycline significantly decreased IL-6, 
TNF-α, IL-23 and were significantly more effective in decreasing the percentage 
of immune cells in the BALF. This is the first in-vivo study to demonstrate that 
Doxycycline can effectively inhibit inflammasome pathways in the lungs.
CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: IV administration of elastin antibody conjugated 
Doxycycline-loaded albumin NPs can effectively modulate the local immune 
environment in the lungs, which is not achieved by IV Doxycycline even at 
100-fold higher dose. This novel method of drug delivery can effectively lead to 
the repurposing of traditional Doxycycline as a potential adjunct treatment for 
managing the cytokine storm in the lungs in COPD and viral infections.

Molecular basis for the recognition of 24-(S)-hydroxycholesterol by integrin 
αvβ3.

A growing body of evidence suggests that oxysterols such as 
25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC) are biologically active and involved in many 
physiological and pathological processes. Our previous study demonstrated that 
25HC induces an innate immune response during viral infections by activating the 
integrin-focal adhesion kinase (FAK) pathway. 25HC produced the proinflammatory 
response by binding directly to integrins at a novel binding site (site II) and 
triggering the production of proinflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis 
factor-α (TNF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). 24-(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24HC), a 
structural isomer of 25HC, plays a critical role in cholesterol homeostasis in 
the human brain and is implicated in multiple inflammatory conditions, including 
Alzheimer's disease. However, whether 24HC can induce a proinflammatory response 
like 25HC in non-neuronal cells has not been studied and remains unknown. The 
aim of this study was to examine whether 24HC produces such an immune response 
using in silico and in vitro experiments. Our results indicate that despite 
being a structural isomer of 25HC, 24HC binds at site II in a distinct binding 
mode, engages in varied residue interactions, and produces significant 
conformational changes in the specificity-determining loop (SDL). In addition, 
our surface plasmon resonance (SPR) study reveals that 24HC could directly bind 
to integrin αvβ3, with a binding affinity three-fold lower than 25HC. 
Furthermore, our in vitro studies with macrophages support the involvement of 
FAK and NFκB signaling pathways in triggering 24HC-mediated production of TNF. 
Thus, we have identified 24HC as another oxysterol that binds to integrin αvβ3 
and promotes a proinflammatory response via the integrin-FAK-NFκB pathway.

This work describes a novel extracellular lipolytic carboxylester hydrolase 
named FAL, with lipase and phospholipase A1 (PLA1) activity, from a newly 
isolated filamentous fungus Ascomycota CBS strain, identified as Fusarium 
annulatum Bunigcourt. FAL was purified to about 62-fold using ammonium sulphate 
precipitation, Superdex® 200 Increase gel filtration and Q-Sepharose Fast Flow 
columns, with a total yield of 21%. The specific activity of FAL was found to be 
3500 U/mg at pH 9 and 40°C and 5000 U/mg at pH 11 and 45°C, on emulsions of 
triocanoin and egg yolk phosphatidylcholine, respectively. SDS-PAGE and 
zymography analysis estimated the molecular weight of FAL to be 33 kDa. FAL was 
shown to be a PLA1 with a regioselectivity to the sn-1 position of 
surface-coated phospholipids esterified with α-eleostearic acid. FAL is a serine 
enzyme since its activity on triglycerides and phospholipids was completely 
inhibited by the lipase inhibitor Orlistat (40 μM). Interestingly, compared to 
Fusarium graminearum lipase (GZEL) and the Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase 
(Lipolase®), this novel fungal (phospho)lipase showed extreme tolerance to the 
presence of non-polar organic solvents, non-ionic and anionic surfactants, and 
oxidants, in addition to significant compatibility and stability with some 
available laundry detergents. The analysis of washing performance showed that it 
has the capability to efficiently eliminate oil-stains. Overall, FAL could be an 
ideal choice for application in detergents.

Campbell AC(1), Fei T(2), Baik JE(1), Park HJ(1), Shin J(1), Kuonqui K(1), Brown 
S(1), Sarker A(1), Kataru RP(1), Mehrara BJ(1).

Lymphedema is a chronic condition that commonly occur from lymphatic injury 
following surgical resection of solid malignancies. While many studies have 
centered on the molecular and immune pathways that perpetuate lymphatic 
dysfunction, the role of the skin microbiome in lymphedema development remains 
unclear. In this study, skin swabs collected from normal and lymphedema forearms 
of 30 patients with unilateral upper extremity lymphedema were analyzed by 16S 
ribosomal RNA sequencing. Statistical models for microbiome data were utilized 
to correlate clinical variables with microbial profiles. Overall, 872 bacterial 
taxa were identified. There were no significant differences in microbial alpha 
diversity of the colonizing bacteria between normal and lymphedema skin samples 
(p = 0.25). Notably, for patients without a history of infection, a one-fold 
change in relative limb volume was significantly associated with a 0.58-unit 
increase in Bray-Curtis microbial distance between paired limbs (95%CI = 
0.11,1.05, p = 0.02). Additionally, several genera, including Propionibacterium 
and Streptococcus, demonstrated high variability between paired samples. In 
summary, we demonstrate high compositional heterogeneity in the skin microbiome 
in upper extremity secondary lymphedema, supporting future studies into the role 
of host-microbe interactions on lymphedema pathophysiology.

Structural and functional features of a broad-spectrum prophage-encoded 
enzybiotic from Enterococcus faecium.

Premetis GE(1), Stathi A(2), Papageorgiou AC(3), Labrou NE(4).

Multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria have become a growing threat to public 
health. The gram-positive Enterococcus faecium is classified by WHO as a 
high-priority pathogen among the global priority list of antibiotic-resistant 
bacteria. Peptidoglycan-degrading enzymes (PDEs), also known as enzybiotics, are 
useful bactericidal agents in the fight against resistant bacteria. In this 
work, a genome-based screening approach of the genome of E. faecium allowed the 
identification of a putative PDE gene with predictive amidase activity (EfAmi1; 
EC 3.5.1.28) in a prophage-integrated sequence. EfAmi1 is composed by two 
domains: a N-terminal Zn2+-dependent N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase-2 
(NALAA-2) domain and a C-terminal domain with unknown structure and function. 
The full-length gene of EfAmi1 was cloned and expressed as a 6xHis-tagged 
protein in E. coli. EfAmi1 was produced as a soluble protein, purified, and its 
lytic and antimicrobial activities were investigated using turbidity reduction 
and Kirby-Bauer disk-diffusion assays against clinically isolated bacterial 
pathogens. The crystal structure of the N-terminal amidase-2 domain was 
determined using X-ray crystallography at 1.97 Å resolution. It adopts a 
globular fold with several α-helices surrounding a central five-stranded 
β-sheet. Sequence comparison revealed a cluster of conserved amino acids that 
defines a putative binding site for a buried zinc ion. The results of the 
present study suggest that EfAmi1 displays high lytic and antimicrobial activity 
and may represent a promising new antimicrobial in the post-antibiotic era.

Exploiting conformational dynamics to modulate the function of designed 
proteins.

Rennella E(1)(2)(3), Sahtoe DD(4)(5)(6), Baker D(4)(5)(6), Kay LE(1)(2)(3)(7).

With the recent success in calculating protein structures from amino acid 
sequences using artificial intelligence-based algorithms, an important next step 
is to decipher how dynamics is encoded by the primary protein sequence so as to 
better predict function. Such dynamics information is critical for protein 
design, where strategies could then focus not only on sequences that fold into 
particular structures that perform a given task, but would also include 
low-lying excited protein states that could influence the function of the 
designed protein. Herein, we illustrate the importance of dynamics in modulating 
the function of C34, a designed α/β protein that captures β-strands of target 
ligands and is a member of a family of proteins designed to sequester β-strands 
and β hairpins of aggregation-prone molecules that lead to a variety of 
pathologies. Using a strategy to "see" regions of apo C34 that are invisible to 
NMR spectroscopy as a result of pervasive conformational exchange, as well as a 
mutagenesis approach whereby C34 molecules are stabilized into a single 
conformer, we determine the structures of the predominant conformations that are 
sampled by C34 and show that these attenuate the affinity for cognate peptide. 
Subsequently, the observed motion is exploited to develop an allosterically 
regulated peptide binder whose binding affinity can be controlled through the 
addition of a second molecule. Our study emphasizes the unique role that NMR can 
play in directing the design process and in the construction of new molecules 
with more complex functionality.

Validation of a novel nutrition risk screening tool in stroke patients.

Xie Y(1)(2), Liu Q(1)(2), Xue H(1)(2), Wei Y(1), Wang J(3), Li Z(4)(2).

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: We aimed to apply a novel nutrition screening tool to 
stroke patients and assess its reliability and validity.
METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional data among 214 imaging-confirmed 
stroke patients were collected between 2015 and 2017 in two public hospitals in 
Hebei, China. Delphi consultation was conducted to evaluate the items in the 
NRS-S scale. Anthropometric indices including body mass index (BMI), triceps 
skin fold thickness (TSF), upper arm circumference (AMC) and mid-arm muscle 
circumference (MAMC) were measured. Internal consistency reliability, 
test-retest reliability, construct validity and content validity were assessed. 
In order to estimate content validity, two rounds Delphi consultation of fifteen 
experts were conducted to evaluate the items in the Nutrition Risk Screening 
Scale for Stroke (NRS-S).
RESULTS: High internal consistency was indicated by Cronbach's alpha of 0.632 
and a split-half reliability of 0.629; test-retest reliability of NRS-S items 
ranged from 0.728 to 1.000 (p<0.0001), except for loss of appetite (0.436, 
p<0.001) and gastrointestinal symptoms (0.213, p=0.042). Content validity index 
of 0.89 indicated robust validity of the items. Regarding construct validity, 
the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin value was 0.579, and the result of the Bartlett test of 
sphericity was 166.790 (p<0.001). Three factors were extracted by exploratory 
factor analysis, which contributed to 63.079% of the variance. Confirmatory 
factor analysis was performed on the questionnaire, finding the p-value of the 
model to be 0.321, indicating a high model fitting index.
CONCLUSIONS: A novel stroke-specific nutritional risk screening tool 
demonstrated a relatively high reliability and validity in its clinical 
application.

In-Cell Penetration Selection-Mass Spectrometry Produces Noncanonical Peptides 
for Antisense Delivery.

Schissel CK(1), Farquhar CE(1), Loas A(1), Malmberg AB(2), Pentelute 
BL(1)(3)(4)(5).

Peptide-mediated delivery of macromolecules in cells has significant potential 
therapeutic benefits, but no therapy employing cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) 
has reached the market after 30 years of investigation due to challenges in the 
discovery of new, more efficient sequences. Here, we demonstrate a method for 
in-cell penetration selection-mass spectrometry (in-cell PS-MS) to discover 
peptides from a synthetic library capable of delivering macromolecule cargo to 
the cytosol. This method was inspired by recent in vivo selection approaches for 
cell-surface screening, with an added spatial dimension resulting from 
subcellular fractionation. A representative peptide discovered in the cytosolic 
extract, Cyto1a, is nearly 100-fold more active toward antisense 
phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) delivery compared to a sequence 
identified from a whole cell extract, which includes endosomes. Cyto1a is 
composed of d-residues and two non-α-amino acids, is more stable than its all-l 
isoform, and is less toxic than known CPPs with comparable activity. Pulse-chase 
and microscopy experiments revealed that while the PMO-Cyto1a conjugate is 
likely taken up by endosomes, it can escape to localize to the nucleus without 
nonspecifically releasing other endosomal components. In-cell PS-MS introduces a 
means to empirically discover unnatural synthetic peptides for subcellular 
delivery of therapeutically relevant cargo.

The yeast ALA synthase C-terminus positively controls enzyme structure and 
function.

Tran JU(1), Brown BL(1)(2).

5-Aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALAS) is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate 
(PLP)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step of heme 
biosynthesis in α-proteobacteria and several non-plant eukaryotes. All ALAS 
homologs contain a highly conserved catalytic core, but eukaryotes also have a 
unique C-terminal extension that plays a role in enzyme regulation. Several 
mutations in this region are implicated in multiple blood disorders in humans. 
In Saccharomyces cerevisiae ALAS (Hem1), the C-terminal extension wraps around 
the homodimer core to contact conserved ALAS motifs proximal to the opposite 
active site. To determine the importance of these Hem1 C-terminal interactions, 
we determined the crystal structure of S. cerevisiae Hem1 lacking the terminal 
14 amino acids (Hem1 ΔCT). With truncation of the C-terminal extension, we show 
structurally and biochemically that multiple catalytic motifs become flexible, 
including an antiparallel β-sheet important to Fold-Type I PLP-dependent 
enzymes. The changes in protein conformation result in an altered cofactor 
microenvironment, decreased enzyme activity and catalytic efficiency, and 
ablation of subunit cooperativity. These findings suggest that the eukaryotic 
ALAS C-terminus has a homolog-specific role in mediating heme biosynthesis, 
indicating a mechanism for autoregulation that can be exploited to 
allosterically modulate heme biosynthesis in different organisms.

Zymosan Particle-Induced Hemodynamic, Cytokine and Blood Cell Changes in Pigs: 
An Innate Immune Stimulation Model with Relevance to Cytokine Storm Syndrome and 
Severe COVID-19.

GT(3)(5), Szabó A(6), Szebeni J(1)(3)(5)(7)(8), Merkely B(4), Radovits T(4).

Hemodynamic disturbance, a rise in neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and 
release of inflammatory cytokines into blood, is a bad prognostic indicator in 
severe COVID-19 and other diseases involving cytokine storm syndrome (CSS). The 
purpose of this study was to explore if zymosan, a known stimulator of the 
innate immune system, could reproduce these changes in pigs. Pigs were 
instrumented for hemodynamic analysis and, after i.v. administration of zymosan, 
serial blood samples were taken to measure blood cell changes, cytokine gene 
transcription in PBMC and blood levels of inflammatory cytokines, using qPCR and 
ELISA. Zymosan bolus (0.1 mg/kg) elicited transient hemodynamic disturbance 
within minutes without detectable cytokine or blood cell changes. In contrast, 
infusion of 1 mg/kg zymosan triggered maximal pulmonary hypertension with 
tachycardia, lasting for 30 min. This was followed by a transient granulopenia 
and then, up to 6 h, major granulocytosis, resulting in a 3-4-fold increase in 
NLR. These changes were paralleled by massive transcription and/or rise in IL-6, 
TNF-alpha, CCL-2, CXCL-10, and IL-1RA in blood. There was significant 
correlation between lymphopenia and IL-6 gene expression. We conclude that the 
presented model may enable mechanistic studies on late-stage COVID-19 and CSS, 
as well as streamlined drug testing against these conditions.

Effects of a Physical Exercise Program and Health Advice on Sedentary Behavior 
of Adolescents.

Silva Filho RCDS(1), Sasaki JE(1), Gordia AP(2), Andaki ACR(1).

Sedentary behavior (SB) is a risk factor for chronic non-communicable diseases. 
This study aimed to assess the effects of an extracurricular physical exercise 
program and health advice on SB in adolescents. This was a non-randomized 
experimental study involving 19 adolescents divided into an intervention group 
(IG) and a control group (CG), aged 13-16 years from a public school in a 
Brazilian municipality. SB was measured using self-reports and accelerometers. 
The intervention included physical exercise and health advice. Repeated measures 
analysis of variance with a significance level of α = 5% was used. There was a 
time*group interaction for the subscapular fold ((pre IG = 16.30 mm vs. CG = 
13.44 mm, post IG = 14.00 mm vs. CG = 15.89 mm) p = 0.001), and VO2MAX ((pre IG 
= 32.75 mL/kg/min vs. CG = 30.66 mL/kg/min, post IG = 35.76 mL/kg/min vs. CG = 
29.28 mL/kg/min) p = 0.008). The accelerometer showed significant differences 
between groups in the total SB ((pre IG = 647.49 min/day vs. CG = 535.24 
min/day, post IG = 614.02 min/day vs. CG = 586.97 min/day) p = 0.045), with a 
significant decrease in the IG. In conclusion, an extracurricular physical 
exercise program and health advice was effective in reducing SB in adolescents.

The Effect of the Height of Coppicing and Harvest Season on the Yield and 
Quality of the Essential Oil of Kunzea ambigua.

Park C(1), Garland SM(1), Close DC(1).

Kunzea ambigua is a small shrub belonging to the Myrtaceae family and the leaves 
are steam-distilled to produce a therapeutically active essential oil. With 
production moving from wild-harvested to orchardised stands, there is a need for 
harvest management of kunzea oil. This study compared the regrowth, essential 
oil content and composition of kunzea plants after harvesting vegetative 
material to a depth of 0.2 m above ground level (shallow-cut), relative to 
plants cut to a depth of 0.1 m above ground level (deep-cut) over the 2018/2019 
growing season. Increased vegetative biomass accounted for the increased oil 
yield and was caused by consistently higher growth rates of 50 to 60% across all 
seasons in shallow-cut crops relative to those subject to deep-cut. Total 
soluble sugar concentrations were higher in the leaves and lower in the roots of 
deep-cut treated plants compared to the other treatments, indicating defoliated 
K. ambigua responds by mobilising sugars into above-ground biomass. The overall 
essential oil content of leaves was constant regardless of season, though the 
oil yield for shallow-cut was 1.9-fold higher at 11.79 ± 0.23 g/m2 compared to 
deep-cut (6.24 ± 0.18 g/m2). An interactive effect of harvest intensity with 
season was recorded for all major components except for a non-significant effect 
of season on terpinen-4-ol. Bicyclogermacrene and α-pinene were elevated in both 
shallow- and deep-cut treatments relative to control (un-cut) in spring, 
possibly due to the plant defense response after de-foliation. The highest 
percentage of bioactive compounds (1,8-cineole and viridiflorol) were present in 
autumn. Therefore, the recovery of biomass post-harvest is optimised by 
shallow-cut harvests, and the profile of kunzea oil can be manipulated to 
elevate levels of specific bioactive components by selecting to crop in 
autumn/spring.

Enhancement of the anticancer effect of atorvastatin-loaded nanoemulsions by 
improving oral absorption via multivalent intestinal transporter-targeting 
lipids.

Byun Y(3)(4), Kim KT(1)(2), Park JW(1)(2).

Atorvastatin (ATV) has attracted considerable attention as a potential 
therapeutic agent for cancer because it inhibits cancer cell proliferation by 
suppressing the mevalonate pathway. However, because of its low oral absorption, 
high doses of ATV are required for chemotherapeutic applications. In this study, 
we constructed ATV-loaded nanoemulsions (ATV-NEs) containing multivalent 
intestinal transporter-targeting lipids to improve the oral bioavailability of 
ATV. ATV-NEs were prepared via oil-in-water emulsification for 
transporter-targeted delivery, and contained the following anchors: an ionic 
complex of deoxycholic acid (DOCA) with the cationic lipid 
1,2-dioleyl-3-trimethylammonium propane (DOTAP) (DOCA-DOTAP), a 
biotin-conjugated lipid (Biotinyl PE), and d-alpha-tocopherol polyethylene 
glycol succinate (TPGS) to allow bile acid- and multivitamin 
transporter-mediated permeation of ATV without P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated 
efflux. The optimized formulation (ATV-NE#6) had 1,091% higher oral 
bioavailability than free ATV. Finally, treatment of 4T1 cell-bearing mice with 
oral ATV-NE#6 (equivalent to 40 mg/kg ATV) significantly suppressed tumor 
growth; the maximum tumor growth reduction was 2.44-fold that of the control 
group. The results thus suggest that ATV-NEs allow for effective oral 
chemotherapy by enhancing the oral bioavailability of ATV.

Multiple chemical valences induced interface regulation in perovskite 
nickelate/carbon nitride for boosting photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

Chen J(1), Tan P(2), Yang L(3), Liu H(1), Zhang M(1), Ren R(1), Zhai H(1), Liu 
X(1), Pan J(4).

Recent developments in transition metal-based photocatalysts have heightened the 
need for superior solar utilization. Evidence suggests that properly adjusting 
the chemical valence of the transition metal elements could simultaneously 
achieve broad-spectrum absorption and efficient charge separation for the 
photocatalysts. However, the understanding and application of this strategy 
remain a significant challenge. Herein, a series of La0.9Ni0.8Co0.2O3-α/g-C3N4 
(LNCO/CN) composites were synthesized employing a mild reduction procedure in 
the H2/Ar atmosphere. Experimental studies reveal that the composites regulated 
by interfacial coordination unsaturation Ni2+ and metal Ni0 possess accelerated 
Z-scheme charge transfer through the interfacial bond between Ni2+ and N. 
Besides, the localized-surface-plasmon-resonance-induced "hot electrons" 
injection process of in situ grown Ni0 nanoparticle is confirmed, which can 
efficiently quench the photoinduced holes and create hole vacancies around the 
interface. Due to the synergistic effect between Ni2+ and Ni0, the lifetime of 
the photo-excited electrons is prolonged with inhibited recombination behavior. 
After modulation, optimal LNCO/CN Z-scheme hybrid exhibits 9-fold promotion of 
photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate compared to pristine LNCO/CN. This study 
gives valuable insight into the purposeful utilization of the chemical valence 
modulating strategy, which alters the chemical valence of transition metal 
elements to enhance the performance of perovskite-based photocatalysts 
dramatically.

Optimization and kinetic modeling of media composition for hyaluronic acid 
production from carob extract with Streptococcus zooepidemicus.

Ozcan A(1), Germec M(1), Turhan I(2).

Hyaluronic acid (HA), a mucopolysaccharide belonging to the glycosaminoglycan 
family, consists of repeating disaccharide units and has been used directly or 
indirectly in numerous human health practices. This study focused on evaluating 
carob pods for microbial HA production and kinetic modeling of HA fermentation. 
Therefore, the optimal medium composition was determined using Plackett-Burman 
Design (PBD) for HA production from carob extract with Streptococcus 
zooepidemicus. Maximum HA production of shake flask fermentation was 2.6 g/L 
(1.25 × 106) in the optimum medium, comprising 10°Bx of carob pods extract, 
0.5 g/L of MgSO4.7H2O, 10.0 g/L of casein, 2.5 g/L of KH2PO4, 2.0 g/L of NaCl, 
1.5 g/L of K2HPO4, 0.002 g/L of FeSO4 and 10.0 g/L of beef extract. In the 
continuation of the study, the fermentation performed with the optimal medium 
composition was modeled using three different models including the logistic 
model for biomass production, the Luedeking-Piret model for HA production, and 
the modified Luedeking-Piret model for substrate consumption. Based on the 
results, the experimental HA production data agreed with the Luedeking-Piret 
model with an R2 of 0.989. Since the α value was 63-fold higher than the value 
of β, the HA production is growth-associated. Consequently, carob extract can be 
evaluated as a promising carbon source for producing HA.

Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids, Gut Microbiota, Microbial Metabolites, and 
Risk of Colorectal Adenomas.

Wang T(1), Brown NM(2), McCoy AN(2), Sandler RS(2)(3), Keku TO(2)(3)(4).

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs) are thought to protect against 
colorectal adenoma (CRA) development. We aimed to further understand the 
underlying mechanisms by examining the relationships between ω-3 PUFAs and the 
gut microbiota on CRAs. We assessed the mucosal microbiota via bacterial 16S 
rRNA sequencing among 217 CRA cases and 218 controls who completed PUFA intake 
questionnaires. The overall microbial composition was assessed by α-diversity 
measurements (diversity, richness, and evenness). Global metabolomics was 
conducted using a random subset of case−control pairs (n = 50). We compared 
microbiota and metabolite signatures between cases and controls according to 
fold change (FC). Odds ratios (OR) and confidence intervals (CI) were estimated 
from logistic regression for associations of ω-3 PUFAs and the microbiota with 
CRAs. We observed an inverse association between overall ω-3 PUFA intake and 
CRAs, especially for short-chain ω -3 PUFAs (OR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.21, 0.97). 
Such inverse associations were modified by bacterial evenness (p-interaction = 
0.03). Participants with higher levels (FC > 2) of bile acid-relevant 
metabolites were more likely to have CRAs than the controls, and the correlation 
between bile acids and bacterial diversity differed by case−control status. Our 
findings suggest that ω-3 PUFAs are inversely associated with CRA development, 
and the association may be modified by gut microbiota profiles.

The choanoflagellate pore-forming lectin SaroL-1 punches holes in cancer cells 
by targeting the tumor-related glycosphingolipid Gb3.

W(7)(8)(9), Lisacek F(10)(11)(12), Imberty A(13).

Choanoflagellates are primitive protozoa used as models for animal evolution. 
They express a large variety of multi-domain proteins contributing to adhesion 
and cell communication, thereby providing a rich repertoire of molecules for 
biotechnology. Adhesion often involves proteins adopting a β-trefoil fold with 
carbohydrate-binding properties therefore classified as lectins. Sequence 
database screening with a dedicated method resulted in TrefLec, a database of 
44714 β-trefoil candidate lectins across 4497 species. TrefLec was searched for 
original domain combinations, which led to single out SaroL-1 in the 
choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta, that contains both β-trefoil and 
aerolysin-like pore-forming domains. Recombinant SaroL-1 is shown to bind 
galactose and derivatives, with a stronger affinity for cancer-related 
α-galactosylated epitopes such as the glycosphingolipid Gb3, when embedded in 
giant unilamellar vesicles or cell membranes. Crystal structures of complexes 
with Gb3 trisaccharide and GalNAc provided the basis for building a model of the 
oligomeric pore. Finally, recognition of the αGal epitope on glycolipids 
required for hemolysis of rabbit erythrocytes suggests that toxicity on cancer 
cells is achieved through carbohydrate-dependent pore-formation.

Targeted Quantitative Profiling of Epitranscriptomic Reader, Writer, and Eraser 
Proteins Using Stable Isotope-Labeled Peptides.

Qi TF(1), Liu X(2), Tang F(2), Yin J(1), Yu K(2), Wang Y(1)(2).

N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) and its reader, writer, and eraser (RWE) proteins 
assume crucial roles in regulating the splicing, stability, and translation of 
mRNA. Aside from m6A, RNA is known to carry many other types of chemical 
modifications; no systematic investigations, however, have been conducted about 
the crosstalk between m6A and other modified nucleosides in RNA. Here, we 
modified our recently established liquid chromatography-parallel-reaction 
monitoring (LC-PRM) method by incorporating stable isotope-labeled (SIL) 
peptides as internal or surrogate standards for profiling epitranscriptomic RWE 
proteins. We were able to detect reproducibly a total of 114 RWE proteins in 
HEK293T cells with the genes encoding m6A eraser proteins (i.e., ALKBH5, FTO) 
and the catalytic subunit of the major m6A writer complex (i.e., METTL3) being 
individually ablated. Notably, eight proteins, including writer proteins for 
5-methylcytidine and pseudouridine, were altered by more than 1.5-fold in the 
opposite directions in HEK293T cells depleted of METTL3 and ALKBH5. Analysis of 
previously published m6A mapping results revealed the presence of m6A in the 
corresponding mRNAs for four of these proteins. Together, we integrated SIL 
peptides into our LC-PRM method for quantifying epitranscriptomic RWE proteins, 
and our work revealed potential crosstalks between m6A and other 
epitranscriptomic modifications. Our modified LC-PRM method with the use of SIL 
peptides should be applicable for high-throughput profiling of epitranscriptomic 
RWE proteins in other cell types and in tissues.

Molecular explorations of the Leishmania donovani 6-phosphogluconolactonase 
enzyme, a key player in the pentose phosphate pathway.

Dhumal TT(1), Kumar R(2), Paul A(1), Roy PK(1), Garg P(3), Singh S(4).

The enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway are vital to survival in 
kinetoplastids. The second step of the pentose phosphate pathway involves 
hydrolytic cleavage of 6-phosphogluconolactone to 6-phosphogluconic acid by 6- 
phosphogluconolactonase (6PGL). In the present study, Leishmania donovani 6PGL 
(Ld6PGL) was cloned and overexpressed in bacterial expression system. 
Comparative sequence analysis revealed the conserved sequence motifs, 
functionally and structurally important residues in 6PGL family. In silico amino 
acid substitution study and interacting partners of 6PGL were predicted. The 
Ld6PGL enzyme was found to be active in the assay and in the parasites. 
Specificity was confirmed by Western blot analysis. The ∼30 kDa protein was 
found to be a dimer in MALDI, glutaraldehyde crosslinking and size exclusion 
chromatography studies. Kinetic analysis and structural stability studies of 
Ld6PGL were performed with denaturants and at varied temperature. Computational 
3D Structural modelling of Ld6PGL elucidates that it has a similar α/β hydrolase 
fold structural topology as in other members of 6PGL family. The three loops are 
found in extended form when the structure is compared with the human 6PGL 
(Hs6PGL). Further, enzyme substrate binding mode and its mechanism were 
investigated using the molecular docking and molecular simulation studies. 
Interesting dynamics action of substrate 6-phosphogluconolactone was observed 
into active site during MD simulation. Interesting differences were observed 
between host and parasite enzyme which pointed towards its potential to be 
explored as an antileishmanial drug target. This study forms the basis for 
further analysis of the role of Ld6PGL in combating oxidative stress in 
Leishmania.

Structural assembly of the nucleic-acid-binding Thp3-Csn12-Sem1 complex 
functioning in mRNA splicing.

Kuang Z(1)(2), Ke J(3), Hong J(2), Zhu Z(1)(2), Niu L(1)(2).

PCI domain proteins play important roles in post-transcriptional gene 
regulation. In the TREX-2 complex, PCI domain-containing Sac3 and Thp1 proteins 
and accessory Sem1 protein form a ternary complex required for mRNA nuclear 
export. In contrast, structurally related Thp3-Csn12-Sem1 complex mediates 
pre-mRNA splicing. In this study, we determined the structure of yeast 
Thp3186-470-Csn12-Sem1 ternary complex at 2.9 Å resolution. Both Thp3 and Csn12 
structures have a typical PCI structural fold, characterized by a stack of 
α-helices capped by a C-terminal winged-helix (WH) domain. The overall structure 
of Thp3186-470-Csn12-Sem1 complex has an inverted V-shape with Thp3 and Csn12 
forming the two sides. A fishhook-shaped Sem1 makes extensive contacts on Csn12 
to stabilize its conformation. The overall structure of Thp3186-470-Csn12-Sem1 
complex resembles the previously reported Sac3-Thp1-Sem1 complex, but also has 
significant structural differences. The C-terminal WH domains of Thp3 and Csn12 
form a continuous surface to bind different forms of nucleic acids with 
micromolar affinity. Mutation of the basic residues in the WH domains of Thp3 
and Csn12 affects nucleic acid binding in vitro and mRNA splicing in vivo. The 
Thp3-Csn12-Sem1 structure provides a foundation for further exploring the 
structural elements required for its specific recruitment to spliceosome for 
pre-mRNA splicing.

Integrated CRISPR-Cas9 System-Mediated Knockout of IFN-γ and IFN-γ Receptor 1 in 
the Vero Cell Line Promotes Viral Susceptibility.

Kim S(1), Nowakowska A(1), Kim YB(1), Shin HY(1).

The current pandemic and the possible emergence of new viruses urgently require 
the rapid development of antiviral vaccines and therapeutics. However, some 
viruses or newly generated variants are difficult to culture in common cell 
types or exhibit low viral susceptibility in vivo, making it difficult to 
manufacture viral vector-based vaccines and understand host-virus interactions. 
To address these issues, we established new cell lines deficient in both type I 
and type II interferon responses, which are essential for host immunity and 
interference with virus replication. These cell lines were generated by 
developing an integrated CRISPR-Cas9 system that simultaneously expresses 
dual-guide RNA cassettes and Cas9 nuclease in a single plasmid. Using this 
highly efficient gene-editing system, we successfully established three cell 
lines starting from IFN-α/β-deficient Vero cells, deleting the single 
interferon-gamma (IFNG) gene, the IFNG receptor 1 (IFNGR1) gene, or both genes. 
All cell lines clearly showed a decrease in IFN-γ-responsive antiviral gene 
expression and cytokine production. Moreover, production of IFN-γ-induced 
cytokines remained low, even after HSV-1 or HCoV-OC43 infection, while 
expression of the receptor responsible for viral entry increased. Ultimately, 
knockout of IFN-signaling genes in these cell lines promoted cytopathic effects 
and increased apoptosis after viral infection up to three-fold. These results 
indicate that our integrated CRISPR-Cas9-mediated IFNG- and IFNGR1-knockout cell 
lines promote virus replication and will be useful in viral studies used to 
design novel vaccines and therapies.

5-HT(3) Receptor MX Helix Contributes to Receptor Function.

Mocatta J(1), Mesoy SM(1), Dougherty DA(2), Lummis SCR(1).

5-HT3 receptors are members of the family of pentameric ligand-gated ion 
channels. Each subunit has an extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular 
domain. Only part of the intracellular domain structure has been solved, 
revealing it contains two α-helical segments; one, the MA helix, is an extension 
of M4, while the other, the MX helix, is formed from residues located close to 
the end of M3. This MX helix is in distinct locations in open and closed 
receptor structures, suggesting it may play a role in function. Here, we explore 
this hypothesis using functional responses of Ala-substituted mutant receptors 
expressed in HEK293 cells. The data show altering many of the MX residues 
results in a small decrease in EC50 (up to 5-fold), although in one (H232A) this 
is increased. Radiolabeled ligand binding on selected mutants showed no change 
in binding affinity, indicating an effect on gating and not binding. In 
addition, five mutations (P316A, V317A, P318A, D319A, and H323A) initially 
resulted in nonfunctional receptors, but the function could be rescued by 
coexpression with a chaperone protein, suggesting a likely role in assembly or 
folding. Examination of previously obtained MD simulation data shows that the 
extent of MX encompassed by membrane lipids differs considerably in the open and 
closed structures, suggesting that lipid-protein interactions in this region 
could have a major effect on channel opening propensity. We conclude that the MX 
helix can modulate the function of the receptor and propose that its 
interactions with membrane lipids play a major role in this.

Chemoprevention of Colitis-Associated Dysplasia or Cancer in Inflammatory Bowel 
Disease.

Hsiao SW(1)(2), Yen HH(1)(3)(4)(5), Chen YY(1)(2)(6).

The association between inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer is well 
known. Although the overall incidence of inflammatory bowel disease has declined 
recently, patients with this disease still have a 1.7-fold increased risk of 
colorectal cancer. The risk factors for developing colorectal cancer include 
extensive colitis, young age at diagnosis, disease duration, primary sclerosing 
cholangitis, chronic colonic mucosal inflammation, dysplasia lesion, and 
post-inflammatory polyps. In patients with inflammatory bowel disease, control 
of chronic inflammation and surveillance colonoscopies are important for the 
prevention of colorectal cancer. The 2017 guidelines from the European Crohn's 
and Colitis Organisation suggest that colonoscopies to screen for colorectal 
cancer should be performed when inflammatory bowel disease symptoms have lasted 
for 8 years. Current evidence supports the use of chemoprevention therapy with 
mesalamine to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer in patients with ulcerative 
colitis. Other compounds, including thiopurine, folic acid, statin, and tumor 
necrosis factor-α inhibitor, are controversial. Large surveillance cohort 
studies with longer follow-up duration are needed to evaluate the impact of 
drugs on colorectal cancer risks.

Genetic engineering of the branched-chain fatty acid biosynthesis pathway to 
enhance surfactin production from Bacillus subtilis.

Jing YF(1), Wei HX(1), Liu FF(1), Liu YF(1), Zhou L(1), Liu JF(1)(2), Yang 
SZ(1)(2)(3), Zhang HZ(1), Mu BZ(1)(2)(3).

Surfactin, which is composed of a β-hydroxy fatty acid chain and a peptide ring, 
has drawn considerable attention due to its potential applications in the 
biomedicine, bioremediation, and petroleum industries. However, the low yield of 
surfactin from wild strains still restricts its industrial applications. In this 
study, eight genes relevant to the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway were targeted 
to enhance surfactin production, and high surfactin-yielding strains with 
potential industrial applications were obtained. When ldeHA and acc were 
co-overexpressed, the surfactin yield of recombinant strains TDS8 and TPS8 
increased to 1.55- and 1.19-fold of their parental strains, respectively, again 
proving that the conversion of acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) to malonyl-CoA is the 
rate-limiting step in fatty acid biosynthesis. Furthermore, changes in surfactin 
isoforms of recombinant strain TPS8 suggest that the fatty acid precursor 
synthesis pathway can be modified to improve the proportion of different 
isoforms. In addition, the deletion of lpdV, which is responsible for the 
conversion of α-ketoacyl-CoA precursors, resulted in a sharp decrease in 
surfactin production, further demonstrating the importance of branched-chain 
fatty acid biosynthesis in surfactin production. This work will facilitate the 
design and construction of more efficiently engineered strains for surfactin 
production and further extend industrial applications.

Cannabinoid Type 2 Receptor Activation Reduces the Progression of Kidney 
Fibrosis Using a Mouse Model of Unilateral Ureteral Obstruction.

Swanson ML(1), Regner KR(2), Moore BM 2nd(1), Park F(1).

Background: Kidney fibrosis is a hallmark consequence of all forms of chronic 
kidney disease with few available treatment modalities. Material and Methods: In 
this study, we performed the unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) procedure to 
investigate the effects of a selective cannabinoid type 2 (CB2) agonist 
receptor, SMM-295, as a nephroprotective therapy. Results: SMM-295 was 
demonstrated to exhibit 50-fold selectivity over the cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) 
receptor with an EC50 ∼2 nM. Four other off-targets were identified in the 
safety panel, but only at the highest concentration (5 mM) tested in the assay 
demonstrating the relative selectivity and safety of our compound. 
Administration of SMM-295 (12 mg/kg IP daily) in UUO mice led to a significant 
decrease of 33% in tubular damage compared to the vehicle-treated UUO mice after 
7 days. Consistent with these findings, there was a significant decrease in 
α-smooth muscle actin and fibronectin, which are markers of tubulointerstitial 
fibrosis, as determined by Western blot analysis. DNA damage as detected by a 
classic marker, γ-H2AX, was significantly reduced by 50% in the SMM-295 
treatment group compared to vehicle treatment. Genetic knockout of CB2 or 
administration of a CB2 inverse agonist did not exhibit any beneficial effect on 
tubulointerstitial fibrosis or kidney tubule injury. Conclusions: In conclusion, 
our study provides new evidence that SMM-295 can therapeutically target the CB2 
receptor with few, if any, physiological off-target sites to reduce kidney 
tissue damage and slow the fibrotic progression in a mouse model of kidney 
fibrosis.

Biocatalysis for biorefineries: The case of dye-decolorizing peroxidases.

Silva D(1), Rodrigues CF(1), Lorena C(1), Borges PT(1), Martins LO(2).

Dye-decolorizing Peroxidases (DyPs) are heme-containing enzymes in fungi and 
bacteria that catalyze the reduction of hydrogen peroxide to water with 
concomitant oxidation of various substrates, including anthraquinone dyes, 
lignin-related phenolic and non-phenolic compounds, and metal ions. 
Investigation of DyPs has shed new light on peroxidases, one of the most 
extensively studied families of oxidoreductases; still, details of their 
microbial physiological role and catalytic mechanisms remain to be fully 
disclosed. They display a distinctive ferredoxin-like fold encompassing 
anti-parallel β-sheets and α-helices, and long conserved loops surround the heme 
pocket with a role in catalysis and stability. A tunnel routes H2O2 to the heme 
pocket, whereas binding sites for the reducing substrates are in cavities near 
the heme or close to distal aromatic residues at the surface. Variations in 
reactions, the role of catalytic residues, and mechanisms were observed among 
different classes of DyP. They were hypothetically related to the presence or 
absence of distal H2O molecules in the heme pocket. The engineering of DyPs for 
improved properties directed their biotechnological applications, primarily 
centered on treating textile effluents and degradation of other hazardous 
pollutants, to fields such as biosensors and valorization of lignin, the most 
abundant renewable aromatic polymer. In this review, we track recent research 
contributions that furthered our understanding of the activity, stability, and 
structural properties of DyPs and their biotechnological applications. Overall, 
the study of DyP-type peroxidases has significant implications for environmental 
sustainability and the development of new bio-based products and materials with 
improved end-of-life options via biodegradation and chemical recyclability, 
fostering the transition to a sustainable bio-based industry in the circular 
economy realm.

TCR-Pred: A new web-application for prediction of epitope and MHC specificity 
for CDR3 TCR sequences using molecular fragment descriptors.

Smirnov AS(1), Rudik AV(2), Filimonov DA(2), Lagunin AA(1)(2).

The search for the relationships between CDR3 TCR sequences and epitopes or MHC 
types is a challenging task in modern immunology. We propose a new approach to 
develop the classification models of structure-activity relationships (SAR) 
using molecular fragment descriptors MNA (Multilevel Neighbourhoods of Atoms) to 
represent CDR3 TCR sequences and the naïve Bayes classifier algorithm. We have 
created the freely available TCR-Pred web application 
(http://way2drug.com/TCR-pred/) to predict the interactions between α chain CDR3 
TCR sequences and 116 epitopes or 25 MHC types, as well as the interactions 
between β chain CDR3 TCR sequences and 202 epitopes or 28 MHC types. The 
TCR-Pred web application is based on the data (more 250 000 unique CDR3 TCR 
sequences) from VDJdb, McPAS-TCR, and IEDB databases and the proposed approach. 
The average AUC values of the prediction accuracy calculated using a 20-fold 
cross-validation procedure varies from 0.857 to 0.884. The created web 
application may be useful in studies related with T-cell profiling based on CDR3 
TCR sequences.

Elevated Levels of the Cytokine LIGHT in Pediatric Crohn's Disease.

Cardinale CJ(1), Abrams DJ(1), Mentch FD(1), Cardinale JA(1), Wang X(1), Kao 
C(1), Sleiman PMA(1)(2), Hakonarson H(1)(2).

LIGHT (homologous to lymphotoxins, exhibits inducible expression, and competes 
with HSV glycoprotein D for herpes virus entry mediator, a receptor expressed by 
T lymphocytes), encoded by the TNFSF14 gene, is a cytokine belonging to the TNF 
superfamily. On binding to its receptors, herpes virus entry mediator and 
lymphotoxin β receptor, it activates inflammatory responses. We conducted this 
study to determine whether plasma LIGHT levels are elevated in Crohn's disease 
(CD) in a pediatric population with the aim of nominating this cytokine as a 
therapeutic target. We used a single-molecule immunoassay to determine the 
circulating levels of free LIGHT in plasma from pediatric patients with CD in 
our biobank (n = 183), a panel of healthy pediatric (n = 9) or adult (n = 22) 
reference samples, and pediatric biobank controls (n = 19). We performed 
correlational analyses between LIGHT levels and the clinical characteristics of 
the CD cohort, including age, Montreal classification, family history, 
medical/surgical therapy, and routine blood test parameters. LIGHT levels were 
greatly elevated in CD, with an average of 305 versus 32.4 pg/ml for controls 
from the biobank (p < 0.0001). The outside reference samples showed levels of 57 
pg/ml in pediatric controls and 55 pg/ml in adults (p < 0.0001). We found a 
statistically significant correlation between white blood cell count and free 
LIGHT (p < 0.046). We conclude that free, soluble LIGHT is increased 5- to 
10-fold in pediatric CD across an array of disease subtypes and characteristics.

A Non-functional γ-Aminobutyric Acid Shunt Pathway in Cyanobacterium 
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 Enhances δ-Aminolevulinic Acid Accumulation under 
Modified Nutrient Conditions.

Kanwal S(1), De-Eknamkul W(1).

To redirect carbon flux from the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) shunt to the 
δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) biosynthetic pathway, we disrupted the GABA shunt 
route of the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 by inactivating 
Gdc, the gene-encoding glutamate decarboxylase. The generated ΔGdc strain 
exhibited lower intracellular GABA and higher ALA levels than the wild-type (WT) 
one. The ΔGdc strain’s ALA levels were ~2.8 times higher than those of the WT 
one when grown with levulinic acid (LA), a competitive inhibitor of 
porphobilinogen synthase. Abiotic stress conditions including salinity induced 
by 10 mM NaCl and cold at 4 °C increased the ALA levels in ΔGdc up to ~2.5 and 5 
ng g−1 cell DW, respectively. The highest ALA production in the ΔGdc 
cyanobacteria grown in BG11 medium was triggered by glucose induction, followed 
by glutamate supplementation with 60 mM of LA, thereby resulting in ~360 ng g−1 
cell DW of ALA, that is >300-fold higher ALA accumulation than that observed in 
ΔGdc cyanobacteria grown in normal medium. Increased levels of the gdhA 
(involved in the interconversion of α-ketoglutarate to glutamate) and the hemA 
(a major regulatory target of the ALA biosynthetic pathway) transcripts occurred 
in ΔGdc cyanobacteria grown under modified growth conditions. Our study provides 
critical insight into the facilitation of ALA production in cyanobacteria.

Circulating Monocytes Serve as Novel Prognostic Biomarker in Pancreatic Ductal 
Adenocarcinoma Patients.

Weber GF(1).

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) ranks among the most fatal cancer 
diseases, widely accepted to have the most dismal prognoses. Although 
immunotherapy has broadly revolutionized cancer treatment, its value in PDAC 
appears to be relatively low. Exhibiting protumoral effects, monocytes have 
recently been proposed as potential targets of such immunotherapeutic regimens. 
However, to date, the body of evidence on monocytes’ role in PDAC is scarce. 
Therefore, we analyzed monocytes in the peripheral blood of 58 PDAC patients 
prior to surgery and compared them to healthy individuals. PDAC patients showed 
increased levels of monocytes when compared to healthy controls In addition, 
patients with perineural infiltration demonstrated a higher percentage of 
monocytes compared to non-infiltrating tumors and PDAC G3 was associated with 
higher monocyte levels than PDAC G2. Patients with monocyte levels > 5% were 
found to have an 8.9-fold increased risk for a G3 and perineural infiltrated 
PDAC resulting in poorer survival compared to patients with <5% monocyte levels. 
Furthermore, PDAC patients showed increased expressions of CD86 and CD11c and 
decreased expressions of PD-L1 on monocytes compared to healthy individuals. 
Finally, levels of monocytes correlated positively with concentrations of IL-6 
and TNF-α in plasma of PDAC patients. Based on our findings, we propose 
monocytes as a novel prognostic biomarker. Large-scale studies are needed to 
further decipher the role of monocytes in PDAC and investigate their potential 
as therapeutic targets.

Conversion of waste cooked rice into maltose by a Bacillus subtilis-derived 
maltogenic amylase and production of maltobionic acid from the prepared maltose 
using genetically modified Pseudomonas taetrolens.

Cho C(1), Eom GT(2).

In this study, we attempted to produce maltobionic acid (MBA) from waste cooked 
rice (WCR) using maltose as an intermediate. In our previous study, we produced 
maltose from WCR using a commercial maltogenic amylase (Maltogenase L). However, 
in the present study, we used wild-type Bacillus subtilis, which inherently 
produces maltogenic amylase (AmyE), instead of Maltogenase L to produce maltose 
from WCR. During cultivation of B. subtilis with WCR, maltose was successfully 
produced by AmyE in the culture medium. To improve maltose production, we 
constructed a recombinant B. subtilis strain expressing AmyE and used it for 
maltose production. Following cultivation of the recombinant B. subtilis strain, 
the maltose production titer (34.6 g/L) increased approximately 3.6-fold that 
(9.6 g/L) obtained from the cultivation of wild-type B. subtilis. Using 
Pseudomonas taetrolens, an efficient MBA-producing bacterium, 28.8 g/L of MBA 
was produced from the prepared maltose (27.6 g/L). The above results indicated 
that MBA was successfully produced from WCR via a two-step process, which 
involved the conversion of WCR into maltose by maltogenic amylase-producing B. 
subtilis and the production of MBA from the WCR-derived maltose by P. 
taetrolens.

Increased Surface Density of States at the Fermi Level for Electron Transport 
Across Single-Molecule Junctions.

Gu MW(1), Lai CT(1), Ni IC(2), Wu CI(2), Chen CH(1).

Fermi's golden rule, a remarkable concept for the transition probability 
involving continuous states, is applicable to the interfacial 
electron-transporting efficiency via correlation with the surface density of 
states (SDOS). Yet, this concept has not been reported to tailor single-molecule 
junctions where gold is an overwhelmingly popular electrode material due to its 
superior amenability in regenerating molecular junctions. At the Fermi level, 
however, the SDOS of gold is small due to its fully filled d-shell. To increase 
the electron-transport efficiency, herein, gold electrodes are modified by a 
monolayer of platinum or palladium that bears partially filled d-shells and 
exhibits significant SDOS at the Fermi energy. An increase by 2-30 fold is found 
for single-molecule conductance of α,ω-hexanes bridged via common headgroups. 
The improved junction conductance is attributed to the electrode self-energy 
which involves a stronger coupling with the molecule and a larger SDOS 
participated by d-electrons at the electrode-molecule interfaces.

The envelope proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV potently reduce the 
infectivity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1).

Henke W(1), Waisner H(1), Arachchige SP(1), Kalamvoki M(1), Stephens E(2).

Update of
    Res Sq. 2022 Oct 24;:

BACKGROUND: Viroporins are virally encoded ion channels involved in virus 
assembly and release. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and influenza 
A virus encode for viroporins. The human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 encodes for at 
least two viroporins, a small 75 amino acid transmembrane protein known as the 
envelope (E) protein and a larger 275 amino acid protein known as Orf3a. Here, 
we compared the replication of HIV-1 in the presence of four different 
β-coronavirus E proteins.
RESULTS: We observed that the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV E proteins reduced the 
release of infectious HIV-1 yields by approximately 100-fold while MERS-CoV or 
HCoV-OC43 E proteins restricted HIV-1 infectivity to a lesser extent. 
Mechanistically, neither reverse transcription nor mRNA synthesis was involved 
in the restriction. We also show that all four E proteins caused phosphorylation 
of eIF2-α at similar levels and that lipidation of LC3-I could not account for 
the differences in restriction. However, the level of caspase 3 activity in 
transfected cells correlated with HIV-1 restriction in cells. Finally, we show 
that unlike the Vpu protein of HIV-1, the four E proteins did not significantly 
down-regulate bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 (BST-2).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that while viroporins from 
homologous viruses can enhance virus release, we show that a viroporin from a 
heterologous virus can suppress HIV-1 protein synthesis and release of 
infectious virus.

Hypertensive nephropathy (HN) requires a kidney biopsy as diagnostic 
gold-standard but histological findings are unspecific and specific prognostic 
markers are missing. We aimed at identifying candidate prognostic markers based 
on glomerular protein signatures. We studied adult patients (n = 17) with eGFR 
>30 ml/min/1.73m2 and proteinuria <3 g/d from the Norwegian Kidney Biopsy 
Registry, including subjects non progressing (NP, n = 9), or progressing (P, 
n = 8) to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) within an average follow-up of 22 
years. Glomerular cross-sections from archival kidney biopsy sections were 
microdissected and processed for protein extraction. Proteomic analyses were 
performed using Q-exactive HF mass spectrometer and relative glomerular protein 
abundances were compared between P and NP patients. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
was used to validate selected data. Amongst 1870 quality filtered proteins, 58 
were differentially expressed in P and NP patients' glomeruli, with absolute 
fold changes (FC) ≥1.5, p ≤ 0.05. Supervised classifier analysis (K nearest 
neighbor) identified a set of five proteins, including Gamma-butyrobetaine 
dioxygenase (BBOX1, O75936) and Cadherin 16 (CDH16, O75309), overexpressed in P, 
and Eosinophil peroxidase (EPX, P11678), DnaJ homolog subfamily B member 1 
(DNAJB1, P25685) and Alpha-1-syntrophin (SNTA1, Q13424), overexpressed in NP 
glomeruli, correctly classifying 16/17 kidney biopsy samples. Geneset Enrichment 
Analysis (GSEA), showed that metabolic pathways were generally enriched in P, 
and structural cell pathways in NP. Pathway analysis identified Epithelial 
Adherens Junction Signaling as most affected canonical pathway. IHC analysis 
confirmed overexpression of BBOX1 and Cadherin 16 in glomeruli from P patients. 
In conclusion, glomerular proteomic profiling can be used to discriminate P from 
NP HN patients.

Improved immunoassay sensitivity and specificity using single-molecule 
colocalization.

Maganzini N(3), Zhong BL(4), Eisenstein M(1)(3), Dunn AR(5), Soh HT(6)(7)(8).

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are a cornerstone of modern 
molecular detection, but the technique still faces notable challenges. One of 
the biggest problems is discriminating true signal generated by target molecules 
versus non-specific background. Here, we developed a Single-Molecule 
Colocalization Assay (SiMCA) that overcomes this problem by employing total 
internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to quantify target proteins based on 
the colocalization of fluorescent signal from orthogonally labeled capture and 
detection antibodies. By specifically counting colocalized signals, we can 
eliminate the effects of background produced by non-specific binding of 
detection antibodies. Using TNF-α, we show that SiMCA achieves a three-fold 
lower limit of detection compared to conventional single-color assays and 
exhibits consistent performance for assays performed in complex specimens such 
as serum and blood. Our results help define the pernicious effects of 
non-specific background in immunoassays and demonstrate the diagnostic gains 
that can be achieved by eliminating those effects.

Prognostic value and potential biological functions of ferroptosis-related gene 
signature in bladder cancer.

Wang Y(1), Shao W(1), Feng Y(1), Tang J(1), Wang Q(1), Zhang D(2), Huang H(1), 
Jiang M(3).

Bladder cancer (BC), as a genitourinary system tumor, is a highly prevalent 
tumor type. Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent oxidative cell death mechanism that 
is becoming increasingly recognized as a promising avenue for cancer therapy. 
However, further determination of the prospective prognostic value of 
ferroptosis for BC and investigation of the underlying mechanisms is required. 
The mRNA expression profiles and associated clinical data were downloaded from 
public databases such as The Cancer Genome Atlas, Gene Expression Omnibus and 
the IMvigor210 database. To construct a predictive formula, the least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator Cox regression algorithm was used. In addition, 
a prognostic multigene signature was constructed using previously selected 
ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs). A total of 28 FRGs were differentially 
expressed between tumor and normal samples with |log2 fold change| >1 and 
adjusted P<0.05. A prognostic model was then established and it was validated in 
the GEO cohort using six genes: Glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit, 
crystallin α-B, transferrin receptor, zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1, 
squalene epoxidase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). Numerous 
important pathways involved in the development of the immune system and cancer 
were indicated to be significantly different between the two risk groups. In 
addition, it was discovered that G6PD expression subgroups that were associated 
with immunotherapy response in patients with BC had similar prognostic features 
to risk score subgroups. In the present study, a gene signature with a 
prognostic value for ferroptosis in BC was successfully developed and the 
potential value of G6PD was identified for future research.

photo/immune therapy.

H(3), Wang S(4).

The accumulation of nanomedicines in tumor tissues determines their therapeutic 
efficacy. We herein exploit the tropism of macrophages to improve the 
accumulation and retention time of nanomedicine at tumors. Interestingly, 
macrophages are not merely as transporters, but killers activated by 
nanomedicine. The system(M@C-HA/ICG) was established by decorating macrophages 
with hyaluronic acid-modified hollow mesoporous carbon (C) nanoparticles loading 
indocyanine green (ICG). Notably, C nanoparticles with superior photothermal 
conversion capability not merely guarantee the efficient delivery of ICG through 
high drug loading efficiency and inhibiting the premature leaky, but effectually 
activate the polarization of macrophages. The results exhibited that those 
activated macrophages could release pro-inflammatory cytokines (NO, TNF-α, 
IL-12), while M@C-HA/ICG afforded about 2-fold higher tumor accumulation 
compared with pure nanoparticle C-HA/ICG and produced heat and singlet oxygen 
(1O2) under irradiation of an 808 nm laser, realizing the combination of 
photodynamic therapy (PDT), photothermal therapy (PTT) and cytokines-mediated 
immunotherapy. Specially, we also investigated the relationship of singlet 
oxygen (1O2) or temperature and tumor-killing activity for understanding the 
specific effectual procedure of PDT/PTT synergistic therapy. Overall, we firstly 
established an "all active" delivery system integrating the features of 
nanomedicine with biological functions of macrophages, providing a novel insight 
for cell-mediated delivery platform and tumor targeted multimodality anti-cancer 
therapy.

Combined cross-linked enzyme aggregates of cyclodextrin glucanotransferase and 
maltogenic amylase from Bacillus lehensis G1 for maltooligosaccharides 
synthesis.

Yip YS(1), Manas NHA(2), Jaafar NR(1), Rahman RA(1), Puspaningsih NNT(3), Illias 
RM(2).

Maltooligosaccharides (MOS) are functional oligosaccharides that can be 
synthesized through enzymatic cascade reaction between cyclodextrin 
glucanotransferase (CGTase) and maltogenic amylase (Mag1) from Bacillus lehensis 
G1. To address the problems of low operational stability and non-reusability of 
free enzymes, both enzymes were co-immobilized as combined cross-linked enzyme 
aggregates (Combi-CLEAs-CM) with incorporation of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 
Tween 80 (Combi-CLEAs-CM-add). Combi-CLEAs-CM and Combi-CLEAs-CM-add showed 
activity recoveries of 54.12 % and 69.44 %, respectively after optimization. 
Combi-CLEAs-CM-add showed higher thermal stability at higher temperatures 
(40 °C) with longer half-life (46.20 min) as compared to those of free enzymes 
(36.67 min) and Combi-CLEAs-CM (41.51 min). Both combi-CLEAs also exhibited 
higher pH stability over pH 5 to pH 9, and displayed excellent reusability with 
>50 % of initial activity retained after four cycles. The reduction in Km value 
of about 22.80 % and 1.76-fold increase in starch hydrolysis in comparison to 
Combi-CLEAs-CM attested the improvement of enzyme-substrate interaction by Tween 
80 and pores formation by BSA in Combi-CLEAs-CM-add. The improved product 
specificity of Combi-CLEAs-CM-add also produced the highest yield of MOS 
(492 mg/g) after 3 h. Therefore, Combi-CLEAs-CM-add with ease of preparation, 
excellent reusability and high operational stability is believed to be highly 
efficacious biocatalyst for MOS production.

An Open Label, Randomized, Multicenter Study of Elafibranor in Children with 
Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.

B(4), Birman P(4), Best BM(5)(6), Addy C(1), Schwimmer JB(1)(2).

OBJECTIVES: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is the most common chronic liver 
disease in children. Elafibranor, a dual peroxisome proliferator-activated 
receptor α/δ agonist, has been proposed as a treatment for NASH. The aims were 
to: 1. describe pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of oral elafibranor 
at 2 doses (80 and 120mg) in children 8-17 years and 2. assess changes in 
aminotransferases.
METHODS: Children with NASH were randomized to open-label elafibranor 80mg or 
120mg daily for 12 weeks. The intent-to-treat analysis included all participants 
who received at least one dose. Standard descriptive statistics and PK analyses 
were performed.
RESULTS: Ten males (mean 15.1yrs, SD 2.2) with NASH were randomized to 80mg 
(n=5) or 120mg (n=5). Baseline mean ALT was 82 U/L (SD 13) and 87 U/L (SD 20) 
for 80mg and 120mg groups, respectively. Elafibranor was rapidly absorbed and 
well tolerated. Elafibranor plasma exposure increased between the 80mg and 120mg 
dose with a 1.9- and 1.3-fold increase in median Cmax and AUC0-24, respectively. 
End of treatment mean ALT was 52 U/L (SD 20) for the 120mg group, with a 
relative mean ALT change from baseline of -37.4% (SD 23.8%) at 12 weeks.
CONCLUSIONS: Once daily dosing of elafibranor was well tolerated in children 
with NASH. There was a 37.4% relative reduction from mean baseline ALT in the 
120mg group. Decreasing ALT may be associated with improvement in liver 
histology, thus could be considered a surrogate for histology in early phase 
trials. These results may support further exploration of elafibranor in children 
with NASH.

Dupilumab Inhibits Vascular Leakage of Blood Proteins Into Atopic Dermatitis 
Skin.

Lyubchenko T(4), Richers BN(4), Garcia S(4), Ramirez-Gama M(4), Hall CF(4), Xiao 
O(4), Taylor P(4), Boguniewicz M(4), Levit NA(6), Agueusop I(7), Zhang A(8), 
Goleva E(4).

BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) skin lesions are associated with oozing, 
bleeding, and erythema. This suggests that AD is associated with vascular 
changes. Dupilumab is an antibody to the alpha subunit of IL-4 receptor that 
demonstrates strong efficacy in the treatment of AD. IL-4 is known to reduce the 
permeability barrier function of vascular endothelium.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of dupilumab on vascular barrier function in 
AD skin.
METHODS: Using proteomic analysis, we evaluated the plasma protein composition 
in skin tapes of lesional and nonlesional skin of adults and adolescents with 
moderate to severe AD over the course of a 16-week treatment with dupilumab and 
compared those with matched healthy subjects.
RESULTS: At baseline, 115 plasma proteins were detected in AD skin and globally 
increased (1.5-fold or greater) compared with healthy skin. Functionally, these 
proteins included immunoglobulins, proteins involved in the coagulation process, 
enzymes, protease inhibitors, transport proteins, acute-phase proteins, 
complement proteins, and other pleiotropic proteins. Noteworthy, fibrinogens, 
fibronectin, and heme-binding proteins haptoglobin and hemopexin were among the 
top proteins originating from plasma and were increased in AD lesional versus 
healthy skin at baseline (P < .0001). Dupilumab treatment resulted in 
significantly reduced levels of plasma proteins in AD skin (P < .0001), with 
most dropping to levels seen in healthy skin or no longer detectable at week 16.
CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of IL-4/IL-13 action by dupilumab significantly reduces 
the efflux of plasma proteins into AD skin. Several of these proteins, such as 
fibrinogens and fibronectin, are known to enhance Staphylococcus aureus 
colonization and are associated with AD skin severity.

Study on the Structure, Function, and Interface Characteristics of Soybean 
Protein Isolate by Industrial Phosphorylation.

Guo Z(1), Zhou L(2).

The impacts of industrial phosphorylation on the structural changes, 
microstructure, functional, and rheological features of soybean protein isolate 
(SPI) were spotlighted. The findings implied that the spatial structure and 
functional features of the SPI changed significantly after treatment with the 
two phosphates. Sodium hexametaphosphate (SHMP) promoted aggregation of SPI with 
a larger particle size; sodium tripolyphosphate (STP) modified SPI with smaller 
particle size. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) results showed 
insignificant alterations in the structure of SPI subunits. Fourier transform 
infrared (FTIR) and endogenous fluorescence noted a decline in α-helix quantity, 
an amplification in β-fold quantity, and an increase in protein stretching and 
disorder, indicating that phosphorylation treatment fluctuated the spatial 
structure of the SPI. Functional characterization studies showed that the 
solubility and emulsion properties of the SPI increased to varying degrees after 
phosphorylation, with a maximum solubility of 94.64% for SHMP-SPI and 97.09% for 
STP-SPI. Emulsifying activity index (EAI) and emulsifying steadiness index (ESI) 
results for STP-SPI were better than those for SHMP-SPI. Rheological results 
showed that the modulus of G' and G″ increased and the emulsion exhibited 
significant elastic behavior. This affords a theoretical core for expanding the 
industrial production applications of soybean isolates in the food and various 
industries.

Compromised conformation and kinetics of catalase in the presence of 
propylthiouracil: A biophysical study and alleviation by curcumin.

Samal RR(1), Sundaray K(1), Tulsiyan KD(2), Saha S(3), Chainy GBN(4), Subudhi 
U(5).

In the present study, the inhibitory effect of propylthiouracil (PTU) on bovine 
liver catalase (BLC) activity was studied in the presence of curcumin (CUR). The 
results suggest that the PTU-induced decrease in BLC activity was caused by a 
change in conformation of BLC with reduced α-helical content and decrease in 
zeta potential. Nevertheless, temperature-dependent activation of CUR protects 
the activity of BLC by restoring the secondary conformation and zeta potential 
of BLC. CUR inhibited the time-induced reduction in BLC activity and the 
protection was increased with increasing concentrations of CUR and found to be 
significant even from 1:0.1 molar ratios. The enzyme kinetics confirmed the high 
catalytic efficiency of BLC in presence of CUR than PTU. The protective role of 
CUR was due to the formation of a more stabilized complex as demonstrated by 
molecular docking, and fourier-transform infrared study. Isothermal titration 
calorimetric study supports for a favourable reaction between BLC and PTU or CUR 
due to the negative ΔH, and positive TΔS. Although the number of binding sites 
for PTU and CUR was found to be 10 and 7, respectively, the binding affinity 
between CUR and BLC is approximately 3.72 fold stronger than BLC-PTU complex. 
The increased melting temperature of BLC was noticed in presence of CUR 
suggesting the protective potential of CUR towards biomolecules. Indeed, this is 
the first biophysical study to describe the molecular mechanism of PTU-induced 
reduction in BLC activity and alleviation by CUR with detail kinetics. Thus, CUR 
can be further extended to other antioxidant enzymes or compromised biomolecules 
for therapeutic interventions.

Sub-lethal concentration of metamifop exposure impair gut health of zebrafish 
(Danio rerio).

Zhao F(1), Guo M(1), Zhang M(1), Duan M(1), Zheng J(1), Liu Y(1), Qiu L(2).

Previous studies have demonstrated that sublethal metamifop exposures induce 
hepatic lipid metabolism disorder in zebrafish. Whether metamifop will cause 
adverse effects in zebrafish gut is unknown. In the present study, effects of 
metamifop on gut heath of zebrafish were investigated after sublethal 
concentration (0.025, 0.10 and 0.40 mg/L) exposure. Histopathology analysis 
showed that metamifop induced inflammation and reduction of goblet cells in the 
gut, indicating that gut health may be impaired. Metamifop exposure could reduce 
activities of digestive enzymes (lipase and alkaline phosphatase), indicating 
the capacity of lipid absorption were impaired. Meanwhile, the content of fatty 
acid-binding protein 2 (FABP2) and mRNA levels of related genes (apoa-1a, 
apoe-b, fatp4, lpl and fabp2) were reduced in zebrafish gut after exposure to 
metamifop, suggesting the lipid transportation were decreased. The transcripts 
of genes associated with inflammation (il-17c, tnf-α and nf-kb) were 
significantly increased in 0.40 mg/L metamifop treatment group, which were 
1.90-, 1.53- and 2.77-fold of the control group, respectively, confirming that 
metamifop induced inflammatory response in zebrafish gut. Moreover, reduction of 
mRNA levels of cldn-15 and elevation of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) content were 
observed in metamifop-treated groups, which suggested that metamifop exposure 
increased the intestinal permeability. Furthermore, metamifop exposure decreased 
the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria (Psychrobacter and Aeromonas) and 
elevated the abundance of pathogenic bacteria (Rhodobacter and Ralstonia) in 
zebrafish intestine. These results indicated that metamifop exposure at 
sublethal concentrations would impair zebrafish gut health, via reduction of 
lipids absorption, inflammatory response, elevation of permeability and 
microbiota disorder.

Low dietary protein increases vitamin A absorption and deposition into milk in 
periparturient rats.

Laarman AH(1)(2), Watts JS(1), Foroudi F(3), Rezamand P(1).

Our objective was to study the effect of differing dietary crude protein and 
vitamin A on retinoid metabolism in a periparturient rat model. Sixty female 
rats, approximately 21 d before parturition, were fed rations containing either 
low protein (13%; LP) or high protein (22%; HP) crude protein and either low 
vitamin A (3 IU/g; LA) or high vitamin A (5 IU/g; HA), yielding treatments HPHA, 
HPLA, LPHA, and LPLA. Samples were collected at d -14, d +3, and +10 relative to 
parturition and analyzed for all-trans retinoid acid (RA), 13-Cis RA, and 
retinol. At d -14, serum all-trans RA concentrations decreased compared to 
baseline. At both d +3 and d +10, serum retinol increased and liver 13-Cis RA 
decreased. In the small intestine, 13-cis RA was higher in HPHA than HPLA 
pre-partum (0.93±0.12 vs. 0.40±0.12 ng/ml, P=0.04). Post-partum, 13-cis RA was 
lower in high vitamin HPHA and LPHA groups (0.35±0.06 and 0.38±0.06 ng/ml) than 
in low vitamin A HPLA and LPLA treatments (0.50±0.06 and 1.32±0.06 ng/ml, 
P<0.01). In rats fed LA diets, TNF-alpha expression tended to be lower in HPLA 
than LPLA groups on day +3 (0.69±0.34 vs 1.00±0.52, P=0.08), but not day +10 
(0.56±0.25 vs. 1.00±0.49 fold change, P>0.10). Retinoids accumulated during 
pregnancy and were mobilized during lactation. The sequestration of retinoids 
was increased when dietary protein content was low. Further studies are needed 
to investigate how retinoid metabolism could be manipulated to improve vitamin A 
delivery to milk.

Cryo-EM structure and rational engineering of a superefficient ochratoxin 
A-detoxifying amidohydrolase.

J(1), Hu Y(1), Yang Y(1), Guo RT(2), Chen CC(3).

Ochratoxin A (OTA) is among the most prevalent mycotoxins detected in 
agroproducts, posing serious threats to human and livestock health. Using 
enzymes to conduct OTA detoxification is an appealing potential strategy. The 
recently identified amidohydrolase from Stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila, termed 
ADH3, is the most efficient OTA-detoxifying enzyme reported thus far and can 
hydrolyze OTA to nontoxic ochratoxin α (OTα) and L-β-phenylalanine (Phe). To 
elucidate the catalytic mechanism of ADH3, we solved the single-particle 
cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of apo-form, Phe- and OTA-bound 
ADH3 to an overall resolution of 2.5-2.7 Å. The role of OTA-binding residues was 
investigated by structural, mutagenesis and biochemical analyses. We also 
rationally engineered ADH3 and obtained variant S88E, whose catalytic activity 
was elevated by 3.7-fold. Structural analysis of variant S88E indicates that the 
E88 side chain provides additional hydrogen bond interactions to the OTα moiety. 
Furthermore, the OTA-hydrolytic activity of variant S88E expressed in Pichia 
pastoris is comparable to that of Escherichia coli-expressed enzyme, revealing 
the feasibility of employing the industrial yeast strain to produce ADH3 and its 
variants for further applications. These results unveil a wealth of information 
about the catalytic mechanism of ADH3-mediated OTA degradation and provide a 
blueprint for rational engineering of high-efficiency OTA-detoxifying 
machineries.

Rare cause of pericardial effusion: 'Erdheim-Chester disease'.

Imtiaz H(1), Hussein M(2), Chan D(3), Garg M(4).

This report details the case of a woman in her 50s who presented with symptoms 
of congestive heart failure and raised inflammatory biochemical markers. Her 
investigations included an echocardiogram, which revealed a large pericardial 
effusion and a subsequent CT-thorax/abdomen/pelvis showing extensive 
retroperitoneal, pericardial and periaortic inflammation and soft-tissue 
infiltration. Genetic analysis of histopathological samples detected a V600E or 
V600Ec missense variant within codon 600 of the BRAF genewith BRAF variants, 
confirming the diagnosis of Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD).The patient's clinical 
management involved several treatments and interventions with input from a 
variety of clinical specialties. This included the cardiology team for 
pericardiocentesis, the cardiac surgical team for pericardiectomy due to 
recurrent pericardial effusions and finally the haematology team for further 
specialist treatment with pegylated interferon and consideration of BRAF 
inhibitor therapy. The patient became stable following treatment with 
significant improvement in her heart failure symptoms. She remains under regular 
joint cardiology and haematology team follow-up. The case highlighted the 
importance of using a multidisciplinary approach to best manage the multisystem 
involvement of ECD.

Proteomic Analysis of the Sphincter in a Neurogenic Bladder Caused by T10 Spinal 
Cord Injury.

Qu QR(1), Tang LY(1), Liu Q(1), Long YY(1), Wu X(1), Xu M(1), Qi F(1), Zhang 
H(1), Ai K(1), Zhou L(2).

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to conduct proteomic analysis of the sphincter in a 
neurogenic bladder caused by T10 spinal cord injury. The differentially 
expressed proteins (DEPs) of the sphincters (internal urethral sphincter) in the 
neurogenic bladders (NBs) of rats after complete transection of the T10 spinal 
cord segment were screened using tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative 
labeling, and their biological information was analyzed.
METHODS: Twelve adult Sprague Dawley rats out of 40 were randomly assigned to 
the blank group (n = 12), while the remaining 28 were placed in the T10 spinal 
cord injury model via modified Hassan Shaker spinal cord transection; 12 of 
these rats were then randomly selected as the model group. The rats in both 
groups underwent urodynamics detection and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. 
The proteins expressed in the bladder sphincter were detected using TMT-based 
quantitative proteomics. DEPs were defined as proteins with fold change >1.5 or 
<1/1.5, p < 0.05, and unique peptide ≥2. The DEPs were subjected to Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis using KOBAS 
3.0., and gene ontology functional annotation analysis was performed using the 
Cytoscape 3.7.1. BiNGO plug-in. The protein-protein interaction network was then 
constructed using the interactive gene-retrieval tool STRING and Cytoscape 
software.
RESULTS: The leak-point pressure and maximum cystometric volume in the model 
group were significantly higher than those in the blank group (p < 0.01), and 
H&E staining showed continuous interruption of the bladder sphincter fibers in 
the model group. A total of 250 DEPs were screened in the bladder sphincter, 83 
of which were up-regulated and 167 of which were down-regulated. KEGG analysis 
of the DEPs was used to screen 15 pathways, including metabolic pathways, 
extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction, adhesion spots, the 
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway, the 
cytochalasin signaling pathway, and the advanced glycation end-products 
(AGE)/receptor for AGEs (RAGE) signaling pathway in diabetic complications and 
vascular smooth muscle contraction.
CONCLUSIONS: It is of great significance to explore the pathological mechanism 
of non-inhibitory contraction of the bladder sphincter caused by spinal cord 
injury above the T10 segment from the perspective of ECM-receptor interaction, 
focal adhesion-activated PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, and cell relaxation 
signaling pathways. Synaptic vesicle glycoprotein (Sv2A) involved in the release 
of neurotransmitters from synaptic vesicles, arrestin β2 inhibitory proteins 
involved in α-adrenergic receptors and G-protein-coupled receptor 
internalization, and calmodulin and calmodulin binding protein involved in 
calcium-sensitive signaling pathways may be potential targets for developing new 
ways to treat bladder sphincter overactivity caused by T10 spinal cord injury.

In vitro activity of a panel of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), 
fatty acids, and pharmaceuticals in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor 
(PPAR) alpha, PPAR gamma, and estrogen receptor assays.

LE Jr(6).

Data demonstrate numerous per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) activate 
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), however, additional 
work is needed to characterize PFAS activity on PPAR gamma (PPARγ) and other 
nuclear receptors. We utilized in vitro assays with either human or rat PPARα or 
PPARγ ligand binding domains to evaluate 16 PFAS (HFPO-DA, HFPO-DA-AS, NBP2, 
PFMOAA, PFHxA, PFOA, PFNA, PFDA, PFOS, PFBS, PFHxS, PFOSA, EtPFOSA, and 4:2, 6:2 
and 8:2 FTOH), 3 endogenous fatty acids (oleic, linoleic, and octanoic), and 3 
pharmaceuticals (WY14643, clofibrate, and the metabolite clofibric acid). We 
also tested chemicals for human estrogen receptor (hER) transcriptional 
activation. Nearly all compounds activated both PPARα and PPARγ in both human 
and rat ligand binding domain assays, except for the FTOH compounds and PFOSA. 
Receptor activation and relative potencies were evaluated based on effect 
concentration 20% (EC20), top percent of max fold induction (pmaxtop), and area 
under the curve (AUC). HFPO-DA and HFPO-DA-AS were the most potent (lowest EC20, 
highest pmaxtop and AUC) of all PFAS in rat and human PPARα assays, being 
slightly less potent than oleic and linoleic acid, while NBP2 was the most 
potent in rat and human PPARγ assays. Only PFHxS, 8:2 and 6:2 FTOH exhibited hER 
agonism >20% pmax. In vitro measures of human and rat PPARα and PPARγ activity 
did not correlate with oral doses or serum concentrations of PFAS that induced 
increases in male rat liver weight from the National Toxicology Program 28-d 
toxicity studies. Data indicate that both PPARα and PPARγ activation may be 
molecular initiating events that contribute to the in vivo effects observed for 
many PFAS.

Association of Lifetime Exposure to Glyphosate and Aminomethylphosphonic Acid 
(AMPA) with Liver Inflammation and Metabolic Syndrome at Young Adulthood: 
Findings from the CHAMACOS Study.

X(1), Limbach C(4), Holland N(1), Bradman A(1)(5), Harley KG(1), Mills PJ(6), 
Mora AM(1).

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of liver disorders and metabolic syndrome has 
increased among youth. Glyphosate, the most widely used herbicide worldwide, 
could contribute to the development of these conditions.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess whether lifetime exposure to glyphosate and its 
degradation product, aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), is associated with 
elevated liver transaminases and metabolic syndrome among young adults.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study (n = 480 mother-child dyads) 
and a nested case-control study (n = 60 cases with elevated liver transaminases 
and 91 controls) using data from the Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers 
and Children of Salinas (CHAMACOS). We measured glyphosate and AMPA 
concentrations in urine samples collected during pregnancy and at child ages 5, 
14, and 18 y from cases and controls. We calculated glyphosate residue 
concentrations: [glyphosate  +  (1.5 × AMPA)]. We estimated the amount of 
agricultural-use glyphosate applied within a 1 - km radius of every residence 
from pregnancy to age 5 y for the full cohort using California Pesticide Use 
Reporting data. We assessed liver transaminases and metabolic syndrome at 18 y 
of age.
RESULTS: Urinary AMPA at age 5 y was associated with elevated transaminases 
[relative risk (RR) per 2 - fold increase = 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI): 
1.06, 1.53] and metabolic syndrome (RR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.38, 3.11). Urinary AMPA 
and glyphosate residues at age 14 y were associated with metabolic syndrome [RR 
= 1.80 (95% CI: 1.10, 2.93) and RR = 1.88 (95% CI: 1.03, 3.42), respectively]. 
Overall, a 2-fold increase in urinary AMPA during childhood was associated with 
a 14% and a 55% increased risk of elevated liver transaminases and metabolic 
syndrome, respectively. Living near agricultural glyphosate applications during 
early childhood (birth to 5 y of age) was also associated with metabolic 
syndrome at age 18 y in the case-control group (RR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.16, 2.02).
DISCUSSION: Childhood exposure to glyphosate and AMPA may increase risk of liver 
and cardiometabolic disorders in early adulthood, which could lead to more 
serious diseases later in life. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP11721.

Cymbopogon citratus and Citral Overcome Doxorubicin Resistance in Cancer Cells 
via Modulating the Drug's Metabolism, Toxicity, and Multidrug Transporters.

Multidrug resistance (MDR) is the major complex mechanism that causes the 
failure of chemotherapy, especially with drugs of natural origin such as 
doxorubicin (DOX). Intracellular drug accumulation and detoxification are also 
involved in cancer resistance by reducing the susceptibility of cancer cells to 
death. This research aims to identify the volatile composition of Cymbopogon 
citratus (lemon grass; LG) essential oil and compare the ability of LG and its 
major compound, citral, to modulate MDR in resistant cell lines. The composition 
of LG essential oil was identified using gas chromatography mass spectrometry 
(GC-MS). In addition, a comparison of the modulatory effects of LG and citral, 
performed on breast (MCF-7/ADR), hepatic (HepG-2/ADR), and ovarian (SKOV-3/ADR) 
MDR cell lines, were compared to their parent sensitive cells using the MTT 
assay, ABC transporter function assays, and RT-PCR. Oxygenated monoterpenes 
(53.69%), sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (19.19%), and oxygenated sesquiterpenes 
(13.79%) made up the yield of LG essential oil. α-citral (18.50%), β-citral 
(10.15%), geranyl acetate (9.65%), ylangene (5.70), δ-elemene (5.38%), and 
eugenol (4.77) represent the major constituents of LG oil. LG and citral (20 
μg/mL) synergistically increased DOX cytotoxicity and lowered DOX dosage by 
>3-fold and >1.5-fold, respectively. These combinations showed synergism in the 
isobologram and CI < 1. DOX accumulation or reversal experiment confirmed that 
LG and citral modulated the efflux pump function. Both substances significantly 
increased DOX accumulation in resistant cells compared to untreated cells and 
verapamil (the positive control). RT-PCR confirmed that LG and citral targeted 
metabolic molecules in resistant cells and significantly downregulated PXR, 
CYP3A4, GST, MDR1, MRP1, and PCRP genes. Our results suggest a novel dietary and 
therapeutic strategy combining LG and citral with DOX to overcome multidrug 
resistance in cancer cells. However, these results should be confirmed by 
additional animal experiments before being used in human clinical trials.

Regiospecific Oxidation of Chlorobenzene to 4-Chlororesorcinol, 
Chlorohydroquinone, 3-Chlorocatechol and 4-Chlorocatechol by Engineered Toluene 
o-Xylene Monooxygenases.

Yanık-Yıldırım KC(1), Phul OK(1), Roth OS(1), Tlatelpa A(1), Soria-P G(1), 
Vardar-Yel N(1), Vardar-Schara G(1).

Toluene o-xylene monooxygenase (ToMO) was found to oxidize chlorobenzene to form 
2-chlorophenol (2-CP, 4%), 3-CP (12%), and 4-CP (84%) with a total product 
formation rate of 1.2 ± 0.17 nmol/min/mg protein. It was also discovered that 
ToMO forms 4-chlorocatechol (4-CC) from 3-CP and 4-CP with initial rates of 
0.54 ± 0.10 and 0.40 ± 0.04 nmol/min/mg protein, respectively, and 
chlorohydroquinone (CHQ, 13%), 4-chlororesorcinol (4-CR, 3%), and 3-CC (84%) 
from 2-CP with an initial product formation rate of 1.1 ± 0.32 nmol/min/mg 
protein. To increase the oxidation rate and alter the oxidation regiospecificity 
of chloroaromatics, as well as to study the roles of active site residues L192 
and A107 of the alpha hydroxylase fragment of ToMO (TouA), we used the 
saturation mutagenesis approach of protein engineering. Thirteen TouA variants 
were isolated, among which some of the best substitutions uncovered here have 
never been studied before. Specifically, TouA variant L192V was identified which 
had 1.8-, 1.4-, 2.4-, and 4.8-fold faster hydroxylation activity toward 
chlorobenzene, 2-CP, 3-CP, and 4-CP, respectively, compared to the native ToMO. 
The L192V variant also had the regiospecificity of chlorobenzene changed from 4% 
to 13% 2-CP and produced the novel product 3-CC (4%) from 3-CP. Most of the 
isolated variants were identified to change the regiospecificity of oxidation. 
For example, compared to the native ToMO, variants A107T, A107N, and A107M 
produced 6.3-, 7.0-, and 7.3-fold more 4-CR from 2-CP, respectively, and 
variants A107G and A107G/L192V produced 3-CC (33 and 39%, respectively) from 
3-CP whereas native ToMO did not. IMPORTANCE Chlorobenzene is a commonly used 
toxic solvent and listed as a priority environmental pollutant by the US 
Environmental Protection Agency. Here, we report that Escherichia coli TG1 cells 
expressing toluene o-xylene monooxygenase (ToMO) can successfully oxidize 
chlorobenzene to form dihydroxy chloroaromatics, which are valuable industrial 
compounds. ToMO performs this at room temperature in water using only molecular 
oxygen and a cofactor supplied by the cells. Using protein engineering 
techniques, we also isolated ToMO variants with enhanced oxidation activity as 
well as fine-tuned regiospecificities which make direct microbial oxygenations 
even more attractive. The significance of this work lies in the ability to 
degrade environmental pollutants while at the same time producing valuable 
chemicals using environmentally benign biological methods rather than expensive, 
complex chemical processes.

Sphingosine kinase 1 mediates sexual dimorphism in fibrosis in a mouse model of 
NASH.

S(3), Allegood J(2), Bandyopadhyay D(4), Retnam R(4), Spiegel S(2), Cowart 
LA(5).

OBJECTIVE: Men with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are more likely to 
progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and liver fibrosis than women. 
However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of this dimorphism is unclear. We 
have previously shown that mice with global deletion of SphK1, the enzyme that 
produces the bioactive sphingolipid metabolite sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), 
were protected from development of NASH. The aim of this study was to elucidate 
the role of hepatocyte-specific SphK1 in development of NASH and to compare its 
contribution to hepatosteatosis in male and female mice.
METHODS: We assessed mouse livers in early-stage fibrosis induced by high fat 
feeding, using single harmonic generation microscopy, LC-MS/MS analysis of 
hydroxyproline levels, and expression of fibrosis markers. We identified an 
antifibrotic intercellular signaling mechanism by culturing primary mouse 
hepatocytes alongside, and in co-culture with, LX2 hepatic stellate cells.
RESULTS: We generated hepatocyte-specific SphK1 knockout mice (SphK1-hKO). 
Unlike the global knockout, SphK1-hKO male mice were not protected from 
diet-induced steatosis, inflammation, or fibrogenesis. In contrast, female 
SphK1-hKO mice were protected from inflammation. Surprisingly, however, in these 
female mice, there was a ∼10-fold increase in the fibrosis markers Col1α1 and 
2-3 fold induction of alpha smooth muscle actin and the pro-fibrotic chemokine 
CCL5. Because increased fibrosis in female SphK1-hKO mice occurred despite an 
attenuated inflammatory response, we investigated the crosstalk between 
hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells, central players in fibrosis. We found 
that estrogen stimulated release of S1P from female hepatocytes preventing 
TGFβ-induced expression of Col1α1 in HSCs via S1PR3.
CONCLUSIONS: The results revealed a novel pathway of estrogen-mediated 
cross-talk between hepatocytes and HSCs that may contribute to sex differences 
in NAFLD through an anti-fibrogenic function of the S1P/S1PR3 axis. This pathway 
is susceptible to pharmacologic manipulation, which may lead to novel 
therapeutic strategies.

Differentiated Embryonic Neurospheres from Familial Alzheimer's Disease Model 
Show Innate Immune and Glial Cell Responses.

H(6).

Proteins involved in the Alzheimer's disease (AD), such as amyloid precursor 
protein (APP) and presenilin-1 (PS1), play critical roles in early development 
of the central nervous system (CNS), as well as in innate immune and glial cell 
responses. Familial AD is associated with the presence of APPswe and PS1dE9 
mutations. However, it is still unknown whether these mutations cause deficits 
in CNS development of carriers. We studied genome-wide gene expression profiles 
of differentiated neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from wild-type and 
APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse embryo telencephalon. The occurrence of strong innate immune 
and glial cell responses in APPswe/PS1dE9 neurospheres mainly involves 
microglial activation, inflammatory mediators and chemokines. APPswe/PS1dE9 
neurospheres augmented up to 100-fold CCL12, CCL5, CCL3, C3, CX3CR1, TLR2 and 
TNF-alpha expression levels, when compared to WT neurospheres. Expression levels 
of the glia cell marker GFAP and microglia marker Iba-1 were up to 20-fold 
upregulated in APPswe/PS1dE9 neurospheres. The secretome of differentiated 
APPswe/PS1dE9 NPCs revealed enhanced chemoattraction of peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells. When evaluating the inferred protein interaction networks 
constructed from the array data, an improvement in astrocyte differentiation in 
APPswe/PS1dE9 neurospheres was evident in view of increased GFAP expression. 
Transgenic NPCs differentiated into neural phenotypes presented expression 
patterns of cytokine, glial cells, and inflammatory mediators characteristic of 
APPswe/PS1dE9 adult animals. Consequently, the neurogenic niche obtained from 
differentiation of embryonic APPswe/PS1dE9 neurospheres spontaneously presents 
several alterations observed in adult AD brains. Finally, our data strengthen 
pathophysiological hypotheses that propose an early neurodevelopmental origin 
for familial AD.

An MRI-Based Prognostic Stratification System for Medical Decision-Making of 
Multinodular Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients Beyond the Milan Criteria.

Wu F(1)(2), Ni X(1)(2), Sun H(1)(2), Zhou C(1)(2)(3), Huang P(1)(2), Xiao 
Y(1)(2), Yang L(1)(2), Yang C(1)(2), Zeng M(1)(2)(3).

BACKGROUND: The suitability of hepatectomy among patients with multinodular 
hepatocellular carcinoma (MHCC) beyond the Milan criteria remains controversial. 
There is a need for a reliable risk stratification tool among these patients for 
the selection of ideal candidates of curative resection.
PURPOSE: To determine the clinicoradiological prognostic factors for patients 
with MHCC beyond the Milan criteria to further develop a stratification system.
STUDY TYPE: Retrospective.
SUBJECTS: 176 patients with pathologically confirmed MHCC beyond the Milan 
criteria.
FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: The 1.5 T scanner, including T1-, T2-, 
diffusion-weighted imaging, in/out-phase imaging, and dynamic contrast-enhanced 
imaging.
ASSESSMENT: Conventional MRI features and preoperative laboratory data including 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and α-fetoprotein (AFP) were collected and 
analyzed. Two nomograms incorporating clinicoradiological variables were 
independently constructed to predict recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall 
survival (OS) with Cox regression analyses and verified with 5-fold cross 
validation. Based on the nomograms, two prognostic stratification systems for 
RFS and OS were further developed.
STATISTICAL TESTS: The Cohen's kappa/intraclass correlation coefficient, 
C-index, calibration curve, Kaplan-Meier curve, log-rank test. A P value <0.05 
was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: AST > 40 U/L, increased tumor burden score, radiological liver 
cirrhosis and nonsmooth tumor margin were independent predictors for poor RFS, 
while AST > 40 U/L, AFP > 400 ng/mL and radiological liver cirrhosis were 
independent predictors for poor OS. The two nomograms demonstrated good 
discrimination performance with C-index of 0.653 (95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.602-0.794) and 0.685 (95% CI, 0.623-0.747) for RFS and OS, respectively. The 
5-fold cross validation further validated the discrimination capability of the 
nomograms. Based on the nomogram models, MHCC patients beyond the Milan criteria 
were stratified into low-/medium-/high-risk groups with significantly different 
RFS and OS.
DATA CONCLUSION: The proposed MRI-based prognostic stratification system 
facilitates the refinement and further subclassification of patients with MHCC 
beyond the Milan criteria.
EVIDENCE LEVEL: 4.
TECHNICAL EFFICACY: 2.

The Relationship Between Diet, Gut Microbiota, and Serum Metabolome of South 
Asian Infants at 1 Year.

BACKGROUND: Diet is known to affect the gut microbiota and the serum metabolome 
in adults, but this has not been fully explored in infants. Infancy is an 
important developmental period that may influence a person's long-term health. 
Infant development can be affected by diet, which also interacts with the 
developing gut microbiota.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the associations between diet, the gut 
microbiota, and the serum metabolome of 1-y-old infants with the overarching 
goal of identifying serum biomarkers of diet and/or the gut microbiota.
METHODS: We derived dietary patterns of 1-y-old infants (n = 182) participating 
in the Canadian South Asian Birth Cohort (START) study. We compared gut 
microbiota α-diversity and β-diversity and taxa relative abundance from 16S rRNA 
gene profiles with dietary patterns (PERMANOVA, Envfit) and investigated 
diet-serum metabolite associations using a multivariate analysis (partial least 
squares-discriminant analysis) and univariate analysis (t test). We explored the 
effect of nondietary factors on diet-serum metabolite relationships by 
incorporating diet, the gut microbiota, and maternal, perinatal, and infant 
characteristics in a multivariable forward stepwise regression. We replicated 
this analysis in White European infants, from the CHILD Cohort Study (n = 81).
RESULTS: A dietary pattern characterized by formula consumption and negatively 
associated with breastfeeding most strongly predicted variation in the gut 
microbiota (R2 = 0.109) and serum metabolome (R2 = 0.547). Breastfed 
participants showed higher abundance of microbes from the genera Bifidobacterium 
(3.29 log2-fold) and Lactobacillus (7.93 log2-fold) and higher median 
concentrations of the metabolites S-methylcysteine (1.38 μM) and tryptophan 
betaine (0.43 μM) than nonbreastfed participants. Formula consuming infants 
showed higher median concentrations of branched-chain/aromatic amino acids 
(average 48.3 μM) than non-formula-consuming infants.
CONCLUSIONS: Formula consumption and breastfeeding most strongly predicted the 
serum metabolites of 1-y-old infants, even when the gut microbiota, solid food 
consumption, and other covariates were considered.

Hemorrhage control is vital for clinical outcomes after surgical treatment and 
pre-hospital trauma injuries. Numerous biomaterials have been investigated to 
control surgical and traumatic bleeding. In this study, for the first time, 
perlite was introduced as an aluminosilicate biomaterial and compared with other 
ceramics such as kaolin and bentonite in terms of morphology, cytotoxicity, 
mutagenicity, and hemostatic evaluations. Cellular studies showed that perlite 
has excellent viability, good cell adhesion, and high anti-mutagenicity. 
Coagulation results demonstrated that the shortest clotting time (140 seconds 
with a concentration of 50 mg mL-1) was obtained for perlite samples compared to 
other samples. Therefore, perlite seems most efficient as a biocompatible 
ceramic for hemorrhage control and other biomaterial designs.

Ex Vivo Evaluation of Glutamine Treatment in Sepsis and Trauma in a Human 
Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells Model.

P(5)(6), Ilia S(6)(7), Kanariou M(1), Routsi C(4), Nanas S(4), Daikos GL(2), 
Briassoulis G(6)(7).

We aimed to assess the lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or heat shock (HS) induction, 
and glutamine-modulating effects on heat shock protein-90α (HSP90α) and 
cytokines in an ex vivo model using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). 
The PBMCs of patients with septic shock, trauma-related systemic inflammatory 
response syndrome (SIRS), and healthy subjects were incubated with 1 μg/mL LPS 
at 43 °C (HS). Glutamine 10 mM was added 1 hour before or after induction or not 
at all. We measured mRNA HSP90α, monocyte (m) and lymphocyte (l) HSP90α 
proteins, interleukin (IL)-1b, -6, -8, -10, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and 
monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) supernatant levels. Heat shock 
increased the HSP90α mRNA and mHSP90α in all groups (10-fold in sepsis, p < 
0.001 and p = 0.047, respectively). LPS induced the mHSP90α and lHSP90α in 
healthy (p < 0.001) and mHSP90α in SIRS (p = 0.004) but not in sepsis. LPS 
induced the cytokines at 24 and 48 h in all groups, especially in trauma (p < 
0.001); HS only induced the IL-8 in healthy (p = 0.003) and septic subjects (p = 
0.05). Glutamine at 10 mM before or after stimulation did not alter any 
induction effect of LPS or HS on HSP90α mRNA and mHSP90α protein in sepsis. In 
SIRS, glutamine before LPS decreased the mHSP90α but increased it when given 
after HS (p = 0.018). Before or after LPS (p = 0.049) and before HS (p = 0.018), 
glutamine decreased the lHSP90α expression in sepsis but increased it in SIRS 
when given after HS (p = 0.003). Regarding cytokines, glutamine enhanced the 
LPS-induced MCP-1 at 48 h in healthy (p = 0.011), SIRS (p < 0.001), and sepsis 
(p = 0.006). In conclusion, glutamine at 10 mM, before or after LPS and HS, 
modulates mHSP90α and lHSP90α in sepsis and SIRS differently and unpredictably. 
Although it does not alter the stimulation effect on interleukins, glutamine 
enhances the LPS induction effect on supernatant MCP-1 in all groups. Future 
research should seek to elucidate better the impact of glutamine and temperature 
modulation on HSP90α and MCP-1 pathways in sepsis and trauma.

BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The efficacy and safety of coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) booster vaccines remain limited. We investigated the immunogenicity 
and adverse events of the third dose of mRNA vaccines in healthy adults.
METHODS: Volunteers vaccinated with two doses of the adenoviral vaccine 
(ChAdOx1) 12 weeks before were administered with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. These 
were divided into three groups, full-dose mRNA-1273 (group 1); half-dose 
mRNA-1273 (group 2); and full-dose BNT-162b2 (group 3). Primary outcomes 
included serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers and 
neutralizing antibody titers against B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.617.2 (delta), and 
B.1.1.529 (omicron) variants. Secondary outcomes included the evaluation of 
humoral and cellular immunity and vaccine-associated adverse events after the 
boost.
RESULTS: Totally 300 participants were recruited, and 298 participants were 
enrolled. For all three groups, an increase in anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG 
geometric mean titers (30.12- to 71.80-fold) and neutralizing antibody titers 
against the alpha variant (69.80- to 173.23-folds), delta variant (132.69- to 
324.63-folds), and omicron variant (135.36- to 222.37-folds) were observed on 
day 28. All groups showed robust T- and B-cell responses after boosting. Adverse 
events were overall mild and transient but with higher prevalence and severity 
in group 1 participants than in other groups.
CONCLUSION: Third dose mRNA COVID-19 vaccines markedly enhanced cellular and 
humoral responses and were safe. Immunological responses and adverse events were 
higher in individuals receiving the full-dose mRNA-1273 vaccine, followed by a 
half-dose mRNA-1273 vaccine and BNT-162b2 vaccine.

Gallocin A, an Atypical Two-Peptide Bacteriocin with Intramolecular Disulfide 
Bonds Required for Activity.

Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (SGG) is an opportunistic gut 
pathogen associated with colorectal cancer. We previously showed that 
colonization of the murine colon by SGG in tumoral conditions was strongly 
enhanced by the production of gallocin A, a two-peptide bacteriocin. Here, we 
aimed to characterize the mechanisms of its action and resistance. Using a 
genetic approach, we demonstrated that gallocin A is composed of two peptides, 
GllA1 and GllA2, which are inactive alone and act together to kill "target" 
bacteria. We showed that gallocin A can kill phylogenetically close relatives of 
the pathogen. Importantly, we demonstrated that gallocin A peptides can insert 
themselves into membranes and permeabilize lipid bilayer vesicles. Next, we 
showed that the third gene of the gallocin A operon, gip, is necessary and 
sufficient to confer immunity to gallocin A. Structural modeling of GllA1 and 
GllA2 mature peptides suggested that both peptides form alpha-helical hairpins 
stabilized by intramolecular disulfide bridges. The presence of a disulfide bond 
in GllA1 and GllA2 was confirmed experimentally. Addition of disulfide-reducing 
agents abrogated gallocin A activity. Likewise, deletion of a gene encoding a 
surface protein with a thioredoxin-like domain impaired the ability of gallocin 
A to kill Enterococcus faecalis. Structural modeling of GIP revealed a 
hairpin-like structure strongly resembling those of the GllA1 and GllA2 mature 
peptides, suggesting a mechanism of immunity by competition with GllA1/2. 
Finally, identification of other class IIb bacteriocins exhibiting a similar 
alpha-helical hairpin fold stabilized with an intramolecular disulfide bridge 
suggests the existence of a new subclass of class IIb bacteriocins. IMPORTANCE 
Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (SGG), previously named 
Streptococcus bovis biotype I, is an opportunistic pathogen responsible for 
invasive infections (septicemia, endocarditis) in elderly people and is often 
associated with colon tumors. SGG is one of the first bacteria to be associated 
with the occurrence of colorectal cancer in humans. Previously, we showed that 
tumor-associated conditions in the colon provide SGG with an ideal environment 
to proliferate at the expense of phylogenetically and metabolically closely 
related commensal bacteria such as enterococci (1). SGG takes advantage of 
CRC-associated conditions to outcompete and substitute commensal members of the 
gut microbiota using a specific bacteriocin named gallocin, recently renamed 
gallocin A following the discovery of gallocin D in a peculiar SGG isolate. 
Here, we showed that gallocin A is a two-peptide bacteriocin and that both GllA1 
and GllA2 peptides are required for antimicrobial activity. Gallocin A was shown 
to permeabilize bacterial membranes and kill phylogenetically closely related 
bacteria such as most streptococci, lactococci, and enterococci, probably 
through membrane pore formation. GllA1 and GllA2 secreted peptides are unusually 
long (42 and 60 amino acids long) and have very few charged amino acids compared 
to well-known class IIb bacteriocins. In silico modeling revealed that both 
GllA1 and GllA2 exhibit a similar hairpin-like conformation stabilized by an 
intramolecular disulfide bond. We also showed that the GIP immunity peptide 
forms a hairpin-like structure similar to GllA1/GllA2. Thus, we hypothesize that 
GIP blocks the formation of the GllA1/GllA2 complex by interacting with GllA1 or 
GllA2. Gallocin A may constitute the first class IIb bacteriocin which displays 
disulfide bridges important for its structure and activity and might be the 
founding member of a subtype of class IIb bacteriocins.

In-Cell Chemical Crosslinking Identifies Hotspots for SQSTM-1/p62-IκBα 
Interaction That Underscore a Critical Role of p62 in Limiting NF-κB Activation 
Through IκBα Stabilization.

Liu Y(1), Trnka MJ(2), He L(1), Burlingame AL(2), Correia MA(3).

We have previously documented that in liver cells, the multifunctional protein 
scaffold p62/SQSTM1 is closely associated with IκBα, an inhibitor of the 
transcriptional activator NF-κB. Such an intimate p62-IκBα association we now 
document leads to a marked 18-fold proteolytic IκBα-stabilization, enabling its 
nuclear entry and termination of the NF-κB-activation cycle. In p62-/--cells, 
such termination is abrogated resulting in the nuclear persistence and prolonged 
activation of NF-κB following inflammatory stimuli. Utilizing various approaches 
both classic (structural deletion, site-directed mutagenesis) as well as novel 
(in-cell chemical crosslinking), coupled with proteomic analyses, we have 
defined the precise structural hotspots of p62-IκBα association. Accordingly, we 
have identified such IκBα hotspots to reside around N-terminal (K38, K47, and 
K67) and C-terminal (K238/C239) residues in its fifth ankyrin repeat domain. 
These sites interact with two hotspots in p62: One in its PB-1 subdomain around 
K13, and the other comprised of a positively charged patch (R183/R186/K187/K189) 
between its ZZ- and TB-subdomains. APEX proximity analyses upon 
IκBα-cotransfection of cells with and without p62 have enabled the 
characterization of the p62 influence on IκBα-protein-protein interactions. 
Interestingly, consistent with p62's capacity to proteolytically stabilize IκBα, 
its presence greatly impaired IκBα's interactions with various 20S/26S 
proteasomal subunits. Furthermore, consistent with p62 interaction with IκBα on 
an interface opposite to that of its NF-κB-interacting interface, p62 failed to 
significantly affect IκBα-NF-κB interactions. These collective findings together 
with the known dynamic p62 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling leads us to speculate 
that it may be involved in "piggy-back" nuclear transport of IκBα following its 
NF-κB-elicited transcriptional activation and de novo synthesis, required for 
termination of the NF-κB-activation cycle. Consequently, mice carrying a 
liver-specific deletion of p62-residues 68 to 252 reveal age-dependent-enhanced 
liver inflammation. Our findings reveal yet another mode of p62-mediated 
pathophysiologically relevant regulation of NF-κB.

a link with bacterial glutamate degradation in the Kenyan colorectal cancer 
patients.

M(10), Guda C(5), Manne U(3)(9), Arafat W(2).

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fifth most diagnosed cancer in 
Sub-Saharan Africa. In Kenya, CRC incidence rates tripled from 1997 to 2017. In 
the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital, Moi University, there has been an 
increase in CRC cases, notably for younger patients. A suggested pathobiology 
for this increase is gut microbiome dysbiosis. Since, for the Kenyan CRC patient 
population, microbiome studies are rare, there is a need for a better 
understanding of how microbiome dysbiosis influences CRC epidemiology in Kenya. 
In this single-center study, the focus was on profiling the gut microbiome of 
Kenyan CRC patients and healthy volunteers and evaluating associations between 
microbiome profiles and the age of CRC patients.
METHODS: The gut mucosa-associated microbiome of 18 CRC patients and 18 healthy 
controls were determined by 16S rRNA sequencing and analyzed for alpha and beta 
diversity, differential abundance, and microbial metabolic profiling.
RESULTS: Alpha diversity metrics showed no significant differences, but beta 
diversity metrics showed dissimilarities in the microbial communities between 
CRC patients and healthy controls. The most underrepresented species in the CRC 
group were Prevotella copri (P. copri) and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (F. 
prausnitzii), although Bacteroides fragilis (B. fragilis) and Prevotella 
nigrescens were overrepresented (linear discriminant analysis, LDA score >2, 
P<0.05). Also, for CRC patients, significant metagenomic functional alterations 
were evident in microbial glutamate metabolic pathways (L-glutamate degradation 
VIII was enriched, and L-glutamate and L-glutamine biosynthesis were diminished) 
(P<0.05, log2 Fold Change >1). Moreover, the microbiome composition was 
different for patients under 40 years of age compared to older patients (LDA 
score >2, P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Microbiome and microbial metabolic profiles of CRC patients are 
different from those of healthy individuals. CRC microbiome dysbiosis, 
particularly P. copri and F. prausnitzii depletion and glutamate metabolic 
alterations, are evident in Kenyan CRC patients.

Gundelia tournefortii inhibits hepatocellular carcinoma progression by lowering 
gene expression of the cell cycle and hepatocyte proliferation in 
immunodeficient mice.

Ghanim M(2), Alqub M(7).

Gundelia (G.) tournefortii has antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and hypolipemic 
effects. We evaluated the anticancer effect of G. tournefortii in an 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mouse model of an HCC cell line (Hep3B) injected 
into NOD.CB17-Prkdc-SCID/NCrHsD male mice. Tumorigenicity was assessed by tumor 
size, histology, serum α-fetoprotein (αFP), and glypican 3 (GPC3). HCC-related 
gene expression of the cell cycle (Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A 
(CDNK2A)), proliferation (MKI67), and platelet-derived growth factor receptor α 
(PDGFA) were measured. HCC cell cycle alterations, apoptosis, and antioxidant 
markers in serum and liver following treatment with G. tournefortii were 
determined. Signaling pathways of liver p53 and phosphorylated PI3K, AKT, and 
mTOR were also evaluated. Results indicate a significant increase in tumor size 
in HCC animals associated with elevated αFP, GPC3, and MKI67. Tumor markers of 
p53 and phosphorylated AKT/PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway were diminished, with 
less proliferating cells and reduced PDGFRA gene expression following G. 
tournefortii infection. H&E staining showed a remarkable reduction in 
inflammatory lesions in HCC mice treated with G. tournefortii. This result was 
in line with a significant delay in the G2/M phase of HCC-primary hepatocytes by 
1.39- to 2.4-fold and reduced HCC necrosis associated with inhibited CDNK2A gene 
expression. Antioxidant activity was significantly lower in the HCC mice than in 
the control group. Moreover, G. tournefortii inhibited the HCC formation of 3D 
MCTS spheroids. G. tournefortii treatment markedly restored antioxidant levels 
and displayed anticancer and antiproliferative effects and could be a promising 
cancer therapy.

Proteomics-based investigation of cerebrovascular molecular mechanisms in 
cerebral amyloid angiopathy by the FFPE-LMD-PCT-SWATH method.

Handa T(1), Sasaki H(1), Takao M(2)(3), Tano M(2), Uchida Y(4)(5).

BACKGROUND: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) occurs in 80% of patients with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is mainly caused by the abnormal deposition of Aβ 
in the walls of cerebral blood vessels. Cerebrovascular molecular mechanisms in 
CAA were investigated by using comprehensive and accurate quantitative 
proteomics.
METHODS: Concerning the molecular mechanisms specific to CAA, formalin-fixed 
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections were prepared from patients having AD 
neuropathologic change (ADNC) with severe cortical Aβ vascular deposition 
(ADNC +/CAA +), and from patients having ADNC without vascular deposition of Aβ 
(ADNC +/CAA -; so called, AD). Cerebral cortical vessels were isolated from FFPE 
sections using laser microdissection (LMD), processed by pressure cycling 
technology (PCT), and applied to SWATH (sequential window acquisition of all 
theoretical fragment ion spectra) proteomics.
RESULTS: The protein expression levels of 17 proteins in ADNC +/CAA +/H donors 
(ADNC +/CAA + donors with highly abundant Aβ in capillaries) were significantly 
different from those in ADNC +/CAA - and ADNC -/CAA - donors. Furthermore, we 
identified 56 proteins showing more than a 1.5-fold difference in average 
expression levels between ADNC +/CAA + and ADNC -/CAA - donors, and were 
significantly correlated with the levels of Aβ or Collagen alpha-2(VI) chain 
(COL6A2) (CAA markers) in 11 donors (6 ADNC +/CAA + and 5 ADNC -/CAA -). Over 
70% of the 56 proteins showed ADNC +/CAA + specific changes in protein 
expression. The comparative analysis with brain parenchyma showed that more than 
90% of the 56 proteins were vascular-specific pathological changes. A 
literature-based pathway analysis showed that 42 proteins are associated with 
fibrosis, oxidative stress and apoptosis. This included the increased expression 
of Heat shock protein HSP 90-alpha, CD44 antigen and Carbonic anhydrase 1 which 
are inhibited by potential drugs against CAA.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of LMD-based isolation of vessels from FFPE 
sections, PCT-assisted sample processing and SWATH analysis (FFPE-LMD-PCT-SWATH 
method) revealed for the first time the changes in the expression of many 
proteins that are involved in fibrosis, ROS production and cell death in 
ADNC +/CAA +  (CAA patients) vessels. The findings reported herein would be 
useful for developing a better understanding of the pathology of CAA and for 
promoting the discovery and development of drugs and biomarkers for CAA.

P(1), Grodkowski G(1), Kostusiak P(1), Grodkowska K(1), Madras-Majewska B(2), 
Sakowski T(3).

The aim of the study was to determine the effect of linseed cake supplementation 
during the winter period as a factor influencing the level of some bioactive 
components (milk composition, fatty-acid profile, and fat-soluble vitamins) in 
the milk fat fraction in cows kept on an organic farm. Forty multiparous (second 
and third lactation) Holstein-Friesian cows were selected that had 81 ± 12 days 
in milk and produced 15.08 ± 1.20 kg of milk/day. Two groups were created for 
the experiment: control (CTL; n = 20) and experimental (LC; n = 20). The 
experiment was divided into two periods: an initial period lasting 7 days in 
which the experimental group was habituated to the new supplement in their diet; 
the proper experimental phase, lasting 6 weeks, in which the cows in the 
experimental group received an individual daily dose of linseed cake (300 
g/day/cow). Linseed cake supplementation had a positive impact on the levels of 
bioactive components (fatty-acid profile and fat-soluble vitamins) in the milk 
fat fraction. At the end of the trial, the concentration of C18:2 cis9 trans11, 
C18:1 trans11, α-retinol, α-tocopherol, and total antioxidant status increased 
1.59-, 1.94-, 3.12-, 3.38-, and 3.09-fold, respectively, relative to the control 
levels. The use of linseed cake in winter on organic farms makes it possible to 
increase the antioxidant potential of milk, thereby eliminating the disparity in 
the quality of milk from the summer season compared to the winter season.

The pulmonary biopharmaceutics and anti-inflammatory effects after intratracheal 
and intravenous administration of Re-Du-Ning injection.

Y(2), Yong-Hong L(3).

BACKGROUND: Re-Du-Ning injection (RDN) is a renowned heat-clearing traditional 
Chinese medicine for the treatment of respiratory diseases owing to its 
anti-inflammatory effects. However, very little is known about the pulmonary 
distribution and lung exposure-efficacy relationships. This study aimed to 
investigate the pulmonary distribution and biopharmaceutics concerning lung 
penetrability and affinity and the local anti-inflammatory effects after 
intravenous and pulmonary administration of RDN.
METHODS: Two iridoids and seven phenolic acid components were selected as the 
chemical markers in RDN. The in vitro pulmonary distribution and 
biopharmaceutics were conducted by evaluating the binding and disassociation 
kinetics of chemical markers in lung tissue explants whereas the in vivo 
evaluation was performed by determining the time-dependent concentrations of 
chemical markers in plasma, lung epithelial lining fluid (ELF), lung tissues and 
immune cells in the ELF after intratracheal and intravenous administrations of 
RDN. The inhibitory effects on tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 
(IL-6) production were used to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of RDN on 
lung tissues in vitro and on mice with LPS-induced lung inflammation.
RESULTS: The chemical markers of RDN exhibited excellent lung penetrability but 
poor lung affinity in vitro and in vivo. After intravenous administration, the 
chemical markers appeared to rapidly penetrate through the lung tissue to reach 
the ELF, leading to markedly higher drug exposure to ELF and immune cells in the 
ELF than to lung tissues. Compared to intravenous injection, the intratracheal 
instillation of RDN increased drug exposure to lung tissue and immune cells in 
the ELF by up to > 80-fold, leading to improved anti-inflammatory potency and 
prolonged duration of action.
CONCLUSION: The drug exposure to immune cells in the ELF was correlated with the 
lung-targeted anti-inflammatory effects of RDN and pulmonary delivery has the 
potential to replace intravenous injection of RDN for the treatment of 
respiratory diseases.

Ligustrazine exerts neuroprotective effects via circ_0008146/miR-709/Cx3cr1 axis 
to inhibit cell apoptosis and inflammation after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion 
injury.

C(1), Wang H(3).

BACKGROUND: Ligustrazine is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine that has long 
been used to treat cerebral ischemic disorders. However, the molecular 
mechanisms of ligustrazine in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) damage have 
not been clear elucidated. The aim of this study was to examine the 
neuroprotective mechanisms of ligustrazine in cerebral I/R.
METHODS: 9 C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided to three groups: Sham group 
(n = 3), Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) group (n = 3), and 
MCAO + Ligustrazine group (n = 3). The neurological deficit score was evaluated, 
the cerebral infarct volume was measured by triphenylterazolium chloride (TTC) 
staining. Differentially expressed (DE) messenger RNAs (mRNAs), long noncoding 
RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs) were analyzed using the R package 
DEseq2 based on P-value < 0.05 and Log2 |fold change (FC)| ≥ 2 in sham group vs 
MCAO group and MCAO group vs ligustrazine group by high-throughput sequencing. 
Function enrichment analysis, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) of 
neurogenesis related genes were performed. The neurogenesis related competitive 
endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network was constructed.
RESULTS: The expression of circ_0008146 was considerably higher in the MCAO 
group than the Sham group, and ligustrazine treatment markedly decreased the 
expression of circ_0008146 in MCAO. Next, the circ_0008146 ceRNA network was 
established, including circ_0008146-miR-709-Cx3cr1 ceRNA network. Besides, real 
time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay identified that 
miR-709 expression was considerably lower and Cx3cr1 expression was higher in 
the MCAO group than Sham group, and ligustrazine treatment markedly increased 
the miR-709 expression and reduced Cx3cr1 expression in MCAO. Further, silencing 
of circ_0008146 inhibited the concentration of Interleukin 6 (IL-6), Tumor 
Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α) and reduced neuron cell death and up-regulated 
miR-709 expression and down-regulated Cx3cr1 expression in Lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS) induced BV-2 cells. Dual-Luciferase reporter gene assay verified that 
circ_0008146 targeted miR-709.
CONCLUSION: Ligustrazine targets circ_0008146/miR-709/Cx3cr1 axis to inhibit 
cell apoptosis and inflammation after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.

This study investigated the effects of dietary supplementation with anthocyanin 
extracted from black rice bran (AR) on the growth rate, immunological response, 
and expression of immune and antioxidant genes in Nile tilapia raised in an 
indoor biofloc system. A total of 300 Nile tilapia fingerlings (15.14 ± 0.032 g) 
were maintained in 150 L tanks and acclimatized for two weeks. Five experimental 
AR diets (0, 1, 2, 4, and 8 g kg-1) with various anthocyanin doses were used to 
feed the fish. We observed that the growth and feed utilization of fish fed with 
different dietary AR levels increased significantly after eight weeks 
(p < 0.05). In addition, the serum immunity of fish fed AR diets was much 
greater than that of those fed non-AR diets (p < 0.05). However, there were 
little or no difference in between fish fed AR enriched diets and the control 
AR-free diet (p > 0.05). After eight weeks, fish fed AR-supplemented diets had 
significantly higher mRNA transcript levels in immune (interleukin [IL]-1, IL-8, 
and liposaccharide-binding protein [LBP]) and antioxidant (glutathione 
transferase-alpha [GST-α] and glutathione reductase [GSR]) genes compared to 
control fish fed the AR-free diet, with the greatest enhancement of mRNA 
transcript levels (in the case of IL-8 by up to about 5.8-fold) in the 
4 g kg-1 AR diet. These findings suggest that dietary inclusion of AR extract 
from black rice bran at 4-8 g kg-1 could function as a herbal immunostimulant to 
enhance growth performance, feed consumption, and immunity in Nile tilapia.

Transcriptome analysis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has been 
pivotal to comprehending the convoluted biology of HNSCC tumors. MAPKAPK2 or MK2 
is a critical modulator of the mRNA turnover of crucial genes involved in HNSCC 
progression. However, MK2-centric transcriptome profiles of tumors are not well 
known. This study delves into HNSCC progression with MK2 at the nexus to 
delineate the biological relevance and intricate crosstalk of MK2 in the tumor 
milieu. We performed next-generation sequencing-based transcriptome profiling of 
HNSCC cells and xenograft tumors to ascertain mRNA expression profiles in 
MK2-wild type and MK2-knockdown conditions. The findings were validated using 
gene expression assays, immunohistochemistry, and transcript turnover studies. 
Here, we identified a pool of crucial MK2-regulated candidate genes by 
annotation and differential gene expression analyses. Regulatory network and 
pathway enrichment revealed their significance and involvement in the HNSCC 
pathogenesis. Additionally, 3'-UTR-based filtering recognized important 
MK2-regulated downstream target genes and validated them by nCounter gene 
expression assays. Finally, immunohistochemistry and transcript stability 
studies revealed the putative role of MK2 in regulating the transcript turnover 
of IGFBP2, MUC4, and PRKAR2B in HNSCC. Conclusively, MK2-regulated candidate 
genes were identified in this study, and their plausible involvement in HNSCC 
pathogenesis was elucidated. These genes possess investigative values as targets 
for diagnosis and therapeutic interventions for HNSCC.

Obesity hormones and itaconate mediating inflammation in human colon cancer 
cells - Another lead to early-onset colon cancer?

Seraphine C(1), Cook CN(1), Rochet A(1), Gaskins JT(2), Galandiuk S(1).

BACKGROUND: Chronic inflammation is a key feature of obesity and a hallmark of 
colon cancer (CC). The obesity-related hormones leptin and adiponectin alter 
inflammatory gene profiles in cancer, but their specific role in CC is unclear. 
We have previously studied the effects of leptin and the macrophage-specific 
mediator itaconate on M2-like macrophages. This current study evaluates their 
effects on CC cells.
METHODS: HT-29 CC cells (derived from a young patient, stage III CC) were 
treated with either leptin, adiponectin, 4-octyl itaconate (OI) or dimethyl 
itaconate (DI). Gene expression after treatment was analyzed at four time points 
(3, 6, 18, and 24 h).
RESULTS: CCL22 was upregulated after treatment with adiponectin (at 18 h [FC 
16.3, p < 0.001]). IL-8 expression increased following both adiponectin (at 3 h 
[FC 68.1, p < 0.001]) and leptin treatments (at 6 h [FC 7.3, p < 0.001]), while 
OI induced downregulation of IL-8 (at 24 h [FC -5.0, p < 0.001]). CXCL10 was 
upregulated after adiponectin treatment (at 6 h [FC 3.0, p = 0.025]) and 
downregulated by both OI and DI at 24 h, respectively (OI [FC -10.0, p < 0.001]; 
DI [FC -10.0, p < 0.001]). IL-1β was upregulated after adiponectin treatment (at 
3 h [FC 10.6, p < 0.001]) and downregulated by DI (at 24 h [FC -5.0, 
p < 0.001]). TNF-α expression was induced following adiponectin (at 6 h [FC 
110.7, p < 0.001]), leptin (at 18 h [FC 5.8, p = 0.027]) and OI (at 3 h [FC 
91.1, p = 0.001]). PPARγ was affected by both OI (at 3 h [FC 10.1, p = 0.031], 
at 24 h [FC -10.0, p = 0.031]) and DI (at 18 h [FC -1.7, p = 0.033]).
CONCLUSIONS: Obesity hormones directly affect inflammatory gene expression in 
HT29 CC cells, potentially enhancing cancer progression. Itaconate affects the 
prognostic marker PPARγ in HT29 CC cells. Leptin, adiponectin and itaconate may 
represent a link between obesity and CC.

Gasoline exposure has been widely reported in the literature as being toxic to 
human health. However, the exact underlying molecular mechanisms triggered by 
its inhalation have not been thoroughly investigated. We herein present a model 
of sub-chronic, static gasoline vapor inhalation in adult female C57BL/6 mice. 
Animals were exposed daily to either gasoline vapors (0.86 g/animal/90 min) or 
ambient air for 5 days/week over 7 consecutive weeks. At the end of the study 
period, toxic and molecular mechanisms underlying the inflammatory, oxidative, 
and apoptotic effects triggered by gasoline vapors, were examined in the lungs 
and liver of gasoline-exposed (GE) mice. Static gasoline exposure induced a 
significant increase (+21%) in lungs/body weight (BW) ratio in GE versus control 
(CON) mice along with a pulmonary inflammation attested by histological 
staining. The latter was consistent with increases in the transcript levels of 
proinflammatory cytokines [Interleukins (ILs) 4 and 6], respectively by ~ 6- and 
4-fold in the lungs of GE mice compared to CON. Interestingly, IL-10 expression 
was also increased by ~ 10-fold in the lungs of GE mice suggesting an attempt to 
counterbalance the established inflammation. Moreover, the pulmonary expression 
of IL-12 and TNF-α was downregulated by 2- and 4-fold, respectively, suggesting 
the skewing toward Th2 phenotype. Additionally, GE mice showed a significant 
upregulation in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, caspases 3, 8, and 9 with no change in JNK 
expression in the lungs, suggesting the activation of both intrinsic and 
extrinsic apoptotic pathways. Static gasoline exposure over seven consecutive 
weeks had a minor hepatic portal inflammation attested by H&E staining along 
with an increase in the hepatic expression of the mitochondrial complexes in GE 
mice. Therefore, tissue damage biomarkers highlight the health risks associated 
with vapor exposure and may present potential therapeutic targets for recovery 
from gasoline intoxication.

Hydrogen Bonding Compensation on the Convex Solvent-Exposed Helical Face of 
IA(3), an Intrinsically Disordered Protein.

Dunleavy KM(1), Oi C(1), Li T(1), Secunda A(1), Jaufer AM(1), Zhu Y(1), Friedman 
L(1), Kim A(1), Fanucci GE(1).

Saccharomyces cerevisiae IA3 is a 68 amino acid peptide inhibitor of yeast 
proteinase A (YPRA) characterized as a random coil when in solution, folding 
into an N-terminal amphipathic alpha helix for residues 2-32 when bound to YPRA, 
with residues 33-68 unresolved in the crystal complex. Circular dichroism (CD) 
spectroscopy results show that amino acid substitutions that remove 
hydrogen-bonding interactions observed within the hydrophilic face of the 
N-terminal domain (NTD) of IA3-YPRA crystal complex reduce the 
2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE)-induced helical transition in solution. Although 
nearly all substitutions decreased TFE-induced helicity compared to wild-type 
(WT), each construct did retain helical character in the presence of 30% (v/v) 
TFE and retained disorder in the absence of TFE. The NTDs of 8 different 
Saccharomyces species have nearly identical amino acid sequences, indicating 
that the NTD of IA3 may be highly evolved to adopt a helical fold when bound to 
YPRA and in the presence of TFE but remain unstructured in solution. Only one 
natural amino acid substitution explored within the solvent-exposed face of the 
NTD of IA3 induced TFE-helicity greater than the WT sequence. However, chemical 
modification of a cysteine by a nitroxide spin label that contains an acetamide 
side chain did enhance TFE-induced helicity. This finding suggests that 
non-natural amino acids that can increase hydrogen bonding or alter hydration 
through side-chain interactions may be important to consider when rationally 
designing intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) with varied biotechnological 
applications.

Metabolic profiling and biological activity of two Livistona species: L. 
chinensis and L. australis.

El-Hawary SS(1), Elwekeel A(2), Abo El-Ela SO(2), Abdelmohsen UR(3)(4), Owis 
AI(2)(5).

Livistona is a genus of family Arecaceae and widely grown in tropical areas. The 
phytochemical analysis of the leaves and fruits of two Livistona species, L. 
chinensis and L. australis were carried out using UPLC/MS and determination of 
the total phenolic and total flavonoid contents, in addition to the isolation 
and identification of five phenolic compounds and one fatty acid from L. 
australis fruits. The total phenolic compounds varied from 19.72 to 78.87 mg GAE 
g-1 dry plant, while the total flavonoid contents were in the range of 
4.82-17.75 mg RE g-1 dry plant. The UPLC/MS analysis of the two species led to 
the characterization of forty-four metabolites belonging mainly to the different 
classes of flavonoids and phenolic acids, while the compounds isolated from L. 
australis fruits were identified as gallic acid, vanillic acid, protocatechuic 
acid, hyperoside, quercetin 3-O-α-d-arabinopyranoside and dodecanoic acid. The 
in vitro biological evaluation of L. australis leaves and fruits were estimated 
as anticholinesterase, telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) potentiation and 
anti-diabetic through measuring the capacity of the extracts to inhibit 
dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP-IV). The results revealed that the leaves showed 
remarkable anticholinesterase and antidiabetic activity compared to fruits with 
IC50 values of 65.55 ± 3.75 ng mL-1 and 90.8 ± 4.48 ng mL-1, respectively. In 
the TERT enzyme assay, the leaves extract triggered a 1.49-fold increase in 
telomerase activity. This work showed that the Livistona species are a good 
source for flavonoids and phenolics, which play an important role in anti-aging 
and the treatment of chronic diseases, such as diabetes and Alzheimer's.

Efficacy of ctDNA methylation combined with traditional detection modality to 
detect liver cancer among high-risk patients: A multicenter diagnostic trial.

Cao M(1), Shi J(1), Xia C(1), Li H(1), Cai W(2), Qi X(3), Dai C(4), Chen W(1).

OBJECTIVE: Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) plus 
ultrasound (US) have been considered to have high diagnostic accuracy for cancer 
detection, however, the efficacy of ctDNA methylation combined with the 
traditional detection modality of liver cancer has not been tested in a Chinese 
independent cohort.
METHODS: The high-risk individuals aged between 35 and 70 years who were 
diagnosed with liver cirrhosis or had moderate and severe fatty liver were 
eligible for inclusion. All participants were invited to receive a traditional 
examination [referring to AFP plus US], and ctDNA methylation, respectively. The 
sensitivity and specificity of different diagnostic tools were calculated. The 
logistic regression model was applied to estimate the area under the curve 
(AUC), which was further validated by 10-fold internal cross-validation.
RESULTS: A total of 1,205 individuals were recruited in our study, and 39 
participants were diagnosed with liver cancer. The sensitivity of AFP, US, US 
plus AFP, and the combination of US, AFP, and ctDNA methylation was 33.33%, 
56.41%, 66.67%, and 87.18%, respectively. The corresponding specificity of AFP, 
US, US plus AFP, and the combination of all modalities was 98.20%, 99.31%, 
97.68%, and 97.68%, respectively. The AUCs of AFP, US, US plus AFP, and the 
combination of AFP, US, and ctDNA methylation were 65.77%, 77.86%, 82.18%, and 
92.43%, respectively. The internally validated AUCs of AFP, US, US plus AFP, and 
the combination of AFP, US, and ctDNA methylation were 67.57%, 83.26%, 86.54%, 
and 93.35%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The ctDNA methylation is a good complementary to AFP and US for the 
detection of liver cancer.

Structural insights into latency of the metallopeptidase ulilysin (lysargiNase) 
and its unexpected inhibition by a sulfonyl-fluoride inhibitor of serine 
peptidases.

Rodríguez-Banqueri A(1), Moliner-Culubret M(1), Mendes SR(1), Guevara T(1), 
Eckhard U(1), Gomis-Rüth FX(1).

Peptidases are regulated by latency and inhibitors, as well as compatibilization 
and cofactors. Ulilysin from Methanosarcina acetivorans, also called 
lysargiNase, is an archaeal metallopeptidase (MP) that is biosynthesized as a 
zymogen with a 60-residue N-terminal prosegment (PS). In the presence of 
calcium, it self-activates to yield the mature enzyme, which specifically 
cleaves before basic residues and thus complements trypsin in proteomics 
workflows. Here, we obtained a low-resolution crystal structure of proulilysin, 
in which 28 protomers arranged as 14 dimers form a continuous double helix of 
544 Å pitch that parallels cell axis b of the crystal. The PS includes two 
α-helices and obstructs the active-site cleft of the catalytic domain (CD) by 
traversing it in the opposite orientation of a substrate, and a cysteine blocks 
the catalytic zinc according to a "cysteine-switch mechanism". Moreover, the PS 
interacts through its first helix with an "S-loop" of the CD, which acts as an 
"activation segment" that lacks one of two essential calcium cations. Upon PS 
removal during maturation, the S-loop adopts its competent conformation and 
binds the second calcium ion. Next, we found that in addition to general MP 
inhibitors, ulilysin was competitively and reversibly inhibited by 
4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF; Ki = 4 μM). This is a compound 
that normally forms an irreversible covalent complex with serine peptidases but 
does not inhibit MPs. A high-resolution crystal structure of the complex 
revealed that the inhibitor penetrates the specificity pocket of ulilysin. A 
primary amine of the inhibitor salt-bridges an aspartate at the pocket bottom, 
thus mimicking the basic side chain of substrates. In contrast, the sulfonyl 
fluoride warhead is not involved and the catalytic zinc ion is freely 
accessible. Thus, the usage of inhibitor cocktails of peptidases, which 
typically contain AEBSF at ∼25-fold higher concentrations than the determined 
Ki, should be avoided when working with ulilysin. Finally, the structure of the 
complex, which occurred as a crystallographic dimer recurring in previous mature 
ulilysin structures, unveiled an N-terminal product fragment that delineated the 
non-primed side of the cleft. These results complement prior structures of 
ulilysin with primed-side product fragments and inhibitors.

    Glia. 2023 Apr 17;:

Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of ischemic stroke, which is a leading cause of 
death and long-term disability. Understanding the exact cellular signaling 
pathways that initiate and propagate neuroinflammation after stroke will be 
critical for developing immunomodulatory stroke therapies. In particular, the 
precise mechanisms of inflammatory signaling in the clinically relevant 
hyperacute period, hours after stroke, have not been elucidated. We used the 
RiboTag technique to obtain astrocyte and microglia-derived mRNA transcripts in 
a hyperacute (4 hours) and acute (3 days) period after stroke, as these two cell 
types are key modulators of acute neuroinflammation. Microglia initiated a rapid 
response to stroke at 4 hours by adopting an inflammatory profile associated 
with the recruitment of immune cells. The hyperacute astrocyte profile was 
marked by stress response genes and transcription factors, such as Fos and Jun , 
involved in pro-inflammatory pathways such as TNF-α. By 3 days, microglia shift 
to a proliferative state and astrocytes strengthen their inflammatory response. 
The astrocyte pro-inflammatory response at 3 days is partially driven by the 
upregulation of the transcription factors C/EBPβ, Spi1 , and Rel , which 
comprise 25% of upregulated transcription factor-target interactions. 
Surprisingly, few sex differences across all groups were observed. Expression 
and log 2 fold data for all sequenced genes are available on a user-friendly 
website for researchers to examine gene changes and generate hypotheses for 
stroke targets. Taken together our data comprehensively describe the astrocyte 
and microglia-specific translatome response in the hyperacute and acute period 
after stroke and identify pathways critical for initiating neuroinflammation.

Antifibrotic Effects of Caffeine, Curcumin and Pirfenidone in Primary Human 
Keratocytes.

Talpan D(1), Salla S(1)(2), Seidelmann N(1), Walter P(1)(2), Fuest M(1)(2).

We evaluated the small molecules (AFM) caffeine, curcumin and pirfenidone to 
find non-toxic concentrations reducing the transformation of activated human 
corneal stromal keratocytes (aCSK) to scar-inducing myofibroblasts (MYO-SF). CSK 
were isolated from 16 human corneas unsuitable for transplantation and expanded 
for three passages in control medium (0.5% FBS). Then, aCSK were exposed to 
concentrations of caffeine of 0−500 μM, curcumin of 0−200 μM, pirfenidone of 
0−2.2 nM and the profibrotic cytokine TGF-β1 (10 ng/mL) for 48 h. Alterations in 
viability and gene expression were evaluated by cell viability staining 
(FDA/PI), real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunocytochemistry. 
We found that all AFMs reduced cell counts at high concentrations. The highest 
concentrations with no toxic effect were 100 µM of caffeine, 20 µM of curcumin 
and 1.1 nM of pirfenidone. The addition of TGF-β1 to the control medium 
effectively transformed aCSK into myofibroblasts (MYO-SF), indicated by a 
10-fold increase in α-smooth muscle actin (SMA) expression, a 39% decrease in 
lumican (LUM) expression and a 98% decrease in ALDH3A1 expression (p < 0.001). 
The concentrations of 100 µM of caffeine, 20/50 µM of curcumin and 1.1 nM of 
pirfenidone each significantly reduced SMA expression under TGF-β1 stimulation 
(p ≤ 0.024). LUM and ALDH3A1 expression remained low under TGF-β1 stimulation, 
independently of AFM supplementation. Immunocytochemistry showed that 100 µM of 
caffeine, 20 µM of curcumin and 1.1 nM of pirfenidone reduce the conversion rate 
of aCSK to SMA+ MYO-SF. In conclusion, in aCSK, 100 µM of caffeine, 20 µM of 
curcumin and 1.1 nM of pirfenidone significantly reduced SMA expression and 
MYO-SF conversion under TGF-β1 stimulation, with no influence on cell counts. 
However, the AFMs were unable to protect aCSK from characteristic marker loss.

Doppler indices of uterine arteries and mRNA transcripts of hormone receptors in 
cervix vis-à-vis dilatation therapy in buffaloes affected with incomplete 
cervical dilatation associated with uterine torsion.

Chaudhari RK(1), Sutaria TV(2), Patel AC(3), Chaudhari CF(2).

The present study aimed to investigate the Doppler indices and mRNA transcripts 
of hormone receptors in relation to the response of dilatation therapy in 
incomplete cervical dilatation (ICD) associated with uterine torsion in 
buffaloes. Out of 36 successfully detorted uterine torsion cases, eight 
buffaloes revealed a fully dilated cervix, while the remaining 28 had ICD, and 
subjected to dilatation therapy (500 μg cloprostenol + 2 mg estradiol benzoate + 
80 mg valethamate bromide + 50 IU oxytocin + 250 mL calcium borogluconate). The 
responses of dilatation therapy were assessed in 26 buffaloes as one died, and 
one could not follow up. Doppler indices of middle uterine arteries on 
trans-rectal ultrasound were evaluated pre- and 30-60 min post-detorsion. 
Cervical tissue biopsies were collected from 16 buffaloes to study mRNA 
transcripts of hormone receptors. The duration, degree, location of uterine 
torsion, fetal viability, consistency of the cervix, relaxation of pelvic 
ligaments, udder engorgement, and gestation length were also recorded to 
evaluate the response of dilatation therapy. The 73.08% (19/26) buffaloes 
responded to the therapy with a duration ranging from 2 to 56 hrs 
(18.41 ± 4.11). The significantly increased blood flow volume (BFV) and 
time-average peak velocity (TAP) while the significantly reduced resistive index 
(RI) and pulsatility index (PI) in an ipsilateral middle uterine artery (MUA) at 
post-detorsion were observed in dilation therapy responded than the 
not-responded group. The mRNA transcripts of estradiol receptors-α (ESR1), 
prostaglandin receptors (PTGFR), and oxytocin receptors (OXTR) were upregulated 
by 7.47, 6.63, and 8.72-fold in the ICD group, respectively. The Doppler indices 
along with duration of illness, location of uterine torsion, consistency of the 
cervix, and udder engorgement can be used to predict the response of dilatation 
therapy in ICD associated with uterine torsion. The upregulated mRNA expression 
of ESR1, PTGFR and OXTR is mandatory for success of dilatation therapy.

Nanoemulsion supported microemulsion electrokinetic chromatography coupled with 
selected preconcentration techniques as an approach for analysis of highly 
hydrophobic compounds.

Pieckowski M(1), Kowalski P(2), Olędzka I(1), Roszkowska A(1), Plenis A(3), 
Bączek T(1).

In this paper, an oil-in-water (O/W) nanoemulsion (NE) prepared by water cold 
dilution of an O/W microemulsion (ME) was introduced as a sample matrix in 
microemulsion electrokinetic capillary chromatography (MEEKC) for the highly 
hydrophobic compounds analysis. Several model compounds with log PO/W values in 
the 4.1-10.9 range, from different chemical groups, including retinol, 
α-tocopherol, cholecalciferol, phylloquinone, menaquinone-7, 
dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, ivermectin have been tested. As a proof of the 
concept of NE formation, a dynamic light scattering technique was employed to 
determine the size distribution profile of NE particles. Moreover, due to 
relatively low conductivity of the NE matrix (50-100 times lower in comparison 
to the separation buffer) and a negative electric charge provided to hydrophobic 
compounds through NE dispersed phase, NE matrices have been combined with 
preconcentration techniques based on electrokinetic dosing, namely field 
amplified sample injection (FASI) and pressure assisted electrokinetic injection 
(PAEKI). The detection limits for vitamin K1 and K2-MK7 in the NE matrix in 
combination with FASI (NE-MEEKC-FASI) as well as PAEKI (NE-MEEKC-PAEKI) were up 
to 42.9 and 12.1 ng mL-1, respectively. In comparison to standard hydrodynamic 
injection for microemulsion sample matrix NE-MEEKC-PAEKI grant 45-fold 
improvement in signal sensitivity. The study presents an innovative approach, as 
it enables the use of preconcentration techniques for highly hydrophobic 
compounds (log PO/W > 4), which was not previously possible for implementation 
in the electromigration techniques. Likewise, the use of organic solvents has 
been reduced by using ME as a solvent for stock solutions and diluting with 
water prior to the analysis. The application to real samples was investigated 
using a dietary supplement containing vitamin K2-MK7 obtained from the 
fermentation product of soybeans.

Suboptimal folic acid exposure rewires oncogenic metabolism and proteomics 
signatures to mediate human breast cancer malignancy.

Huang RS(5).

Whether treatment with folic acid (FA) affects human breast cancer positively or 
negatively remains unclear. We subjected human Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 
cells, a human breast cancer cell line, to suboptimal FA at low levels (10 nM; 
LF) and high levels (50 μM; HF) and investigated the molecular mechanisms 
underlying their effects through metabolic flux and systematic proteomics 
analyses. The data indicated that LF induced and HF aggravated 2-fold higher 
mitochondrial toxicity in terms of suppressed oxidative respiration, increased 
fermented glycolysis, and enhanced anchorage-independent oncospheroid formation. 
Quantitative proteomics and Gene Ontology enrichment analysis were used to 
profile LF- and HF-altered proteins involved in metabolism, apoptosis, and 
malignancy pathways. Through STRING analysis, we identified a connection network 
between LF- and HF-altered proteins with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). 
Rapamycin-induced blockage of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling, which regulates 
metabolism, differentially inhibited LF- and HF-modulated protein signatures of 
mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase ubiquinone flavoprotein 2, mitochondrial 
glutathione peroxidase 4, kynureninase, and alpha-crystallin B chain as well as 
programmed cell death 5 in transcript levels; it subsequently diminished 
apoptosis and oncospheroid formation in LF/HF-exposed cells. Taken together, our 
data indicate that suboptimal FA treatment rewired oncogenic metabolism and 
mTORC1-mediated proteomics signatures to promote breast cancer development.

Hyperactive behaviour of growth differentiation factor- 15 (GDF-15) in 
conjunction with iron trafficking transporters and suppression of Nrf-2 gene in 
diabetes and metabolic syndrome.

MA(6), Arulselvi S(7), Pandey S(8).

Multiple parallel factors are frequently interrogated with various toxic 
radicals which are abundantly generated in the liver, heart, and pancreas in 
stress conditions. They are actively involved in the development of diabetes and 
metabolic aberrations. However, whether over-activation of GDF-15mRNA and 
influxes of iron-by-iron trafficking genes are directly suppressing the Nrf-2 
gene in patients with diabetes and metabolic aberrations in context with 
undiagnosed individuals with diabetes and metabolic aberrations? Therefore, we 
have investigated inter and intra- related Zip8/14 mRNA, GDF-15mRNA, and Nrf-2 
mRNA expressions in diabetes and metabolic syndrome as it is expected to be up 
to 134 million by 2045 in India. We recruited 120 subjects from the Department 
of Medicine, Endocrinology and Metabolic Clinic, All India Institute of Medical 
Sciences, New Delhi, India. Various investigations related to anthropometry, 
nutritional, hematological, biochemical, cytokine, and oxidative stress were 
measured in diabetes, metabolic syndrome, diabetes with metabolic aberration, 
and healthy controls. Relative expression of GDF-15, ZIP8, ZIP14, Nrf-2, and 
housekeeping genes was done in all subjects. Stress-responsive cytokines are 
highly expressed in patients with metabolic aberration with respect to body 
weight, IR, waist circumference, and fat mass. IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 levels 
were significantly higher in metabolic syndrome, whereas Adiponectin levels were 
profoundly lower side. MDA levels were significantly raised in diabetes with 
metabolic syndrome while SOD activities were lowered (p = 0.001). GDF-15 mRNA 
expression was 1.79-fold upregulated in group III as compared with Group I while 
2-threefold down-regulation of Nrf-2 expression was observed in diabetes with 
metabolic aberration groups. Zip 8 mRNA expressions were downregulated 
(p = 0.014), and Zip 14 mRNA expressions were upregulated (p = 0.06) in diabetes 
and metabolic aberrations. The association of GDF-15 and Nrf-2 mRNA expression 
was found contradictory and highly interlinked with ROS. Zip 8/14mRNA 
expressions were also dysregulated in diabetes and metabolic-associated 
complications.

Effects of processing methods on the aroma constituents of hihatsumodoki (Piper 
retrofractum Vahl).

M(1)(2).

Hihatsumodoki (Piper retrofractum Vahl) is a traditional spice from Okinawa 
(Japan) that can be processed in different ways to create the desired flavor. 
Herein, we examined the effects of processing (sun-drying, oven-drying, 
roasting, and steaming) on the volatile aroma constituents of hihatsumodoki 
fruits. Among the 106 chromatographic peaks observed in total, 58 were assigned 
to known aroma compounds. The relative contents of terpenes, for example, 
linalool, β-caryophyllene, α-caryophyllene, and germacrene D, ranged from 57.6% 
to 88.1%. Sun-drying decreased the content of aldehydes such as hexanal and 
trans-2-hexenal but did not significantly affect the total content of aroma 
compounds. The amount of aroma compounds released during oven-drying and 
roasting increased with temperature up to a certain point (90°C) and decreased 
at an excessively high temperature of 180°C. High-temperature roasting generated 
Maillard reaction products such as furans and furanones, which could impart 
sweet caramel odors. Steamed fruits had the lowest content of aroma compounds, 
which was ascribed to the loss of these compounds to vapor. Meanwhile, drying 
steamed fruits resulted in an approximately 3.6-fold increase in their aroma 
compound content, and the content of sesquiterpenes in the steamed-dried fruits 
was similar to that in fruits exposed to high temperatures. The effects of 
processing on aroma quality were visualized using multivariate statistical 
analysis. The aroma characteristics of roasted (180°C), steamed, and 
steamed-dried fruits were different from those of the control. The combined 
findings provide useful information for the selection of processing methods to 
achieve the desired flavor of hihatsumodoki. Practical Application: This study 
reveals the effects of different processing methods on the aroma profile of 
hihatsumodoki (Piper retrofractum Vahl), a subtropical spice from Okinawa 
(Japan). The results facilitate the selection of preferred hihatsumodoki flavors 
for household and industrial applications in foods and beverages. In addition, 
they inspire research on the processing-induced flavor changes of other tropical 
or subtropical spices.

The effect of blocking immune checkpoints LAG-3 and PD-1 on human invariant 
Natural Killer T cell function.

Balasko AL(1), Kowatsch MM(1), Graydon C(1), Lajoie J(1)(2), Fowke 
KR(3)(4)(5)(6).

Invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) cells undergo immune exhaustion during chronic 
activation caused by cancer and viral infections, such as HIV. Exhaustion is 
marked by cell dysfunction and increased expression of immune checkpoint 
proteins programmed cell-death-1 (PD-1) and lymphocyte-activation-gene-3 
(LAG-3). We hypothesize that blockade of PD-1 and/or LAG-3 will enhance iNKT 
cell function. Utilizing peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors, 
LAG-3 and PD-1 expression on iNKT cells was assessed using flow cytometry 
following in vitro stimulation with iNKT-specific stimulant α-galactosylceramide 
(n = 4). Efficacy of anti-LAG-3 and/or anti-PD-1 antibody blockades in enhancing 
iNKT cell function was assessed by determining proliferative capacity and IFN-γ 
production (n = 9). LAG-3 and PD-1 expression on iNKT cells peaked at Day 4 
(98.8%; p ≤ 0.0001 and 98.8%; p = 0.005, respectively), followed by steep 
decrease by Day 10, coinciding with peak iNKT cell proliferation. In a 10-day 
blocking assay, both the anti-PD-1 alone and dual anti-PD-1 and anti-LAG-3 
significantly increased iNKT proliferation (6 and 6.29 log2 fold-change 
respectively) compared to the no blockade control (ANOVA-p = 0.0005) with the 
dual blockade system being more effective (t-test-p = 0.013). This provides 
proof-of-concept for LAG-3 and PD-1 as immunotherapeutic targets to enhance 
human iNKT cell function, with the long-term goal of addressing immune 
exhaustion.

Heterologous Expression of Plantaricin 423 and Mundticin ST4SA in Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae.

WH(1), Dicks LMT(1), Viljoen-Bloom M(3).

Antimicrobial peptides or bacteriocins are excellent candidates for alternative 
antimicrobials, but high manufacturing costs limit their applications. 
Recombinant gene expression offers the potential to produce these peptides more 
cost-effectively at a larger scale. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a popular host 
for recombinant protein production, but with limited success reported on 
antimicrobial peptides. Individual recombinant S. cerevisiae strains were 
constructed to secrete two class IIa bacteriocins, plantaricin 423 (PlaX) and 
mundticin ST4SA (MunX). The native and codon-optimised variants of the plaA and 
munST4SA genes were cloned into episomal expression vectors containing either 
the S. cerevisiae alpha mating factor (MFα1) or the Trichoderma reesei xylanase 
2 (XYNSEC) secretion signal sequences. The recombinant peptides retained their 
activity and stability, with the MFα1 secretion signal superior to the XYNSEC 
secretion signal for both bacteriocins. An eight-fold increase in activity 
against Listeria monocytogenes was observed for MunX after codon optimisation, 
but not for PlaX-producing strains. After HPLC-purification, the codon-optimised 
genes yielded 20.9 mg/L of MunX and 18.4 mg/L of PlaX, which displayed minimum 
inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 108.52 nM and 1.18 µM, respectively, against 
L. monocytogenes. The yields represent a marked improvement relative to an 
Escherichia coli expression system previously reported for PlaX and MunX. The 
results demonstrated that S. cerevisiae is a promising host for recombinant 
bacteriocin production that requires a simple purification process, but the 
efficacy is sensitive to codon usage and secretion signals.

Unveiling the functional components and antivirulence activity of mustard leaves 
using an LC-MS/MS, molecular networking, and multivariate data analysis 
integrated approach.

Ibrahim RM(1), M Eltanany B(2), Pont L(3), Benavente F(4), ElBanna SA(5), Otify 
AM(6).

Plant extracts have recently received increased attention as alternative sources 
of antimicrobial agents in the fight against multidrug-resistant bacteria. 
Non-targeted metabolomics liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight tandem 
mass spectrometry, molecular networking, and chemometrics were used to evaluate 
the metabolic profiles of red and green leaves of two Brassica juncea (L.) 
varieties, var. integrifolia (IR and IG) and var. rugosa (RR and RG), as well as 
to establish a relationship between the elucidated chemical profiles and 
antivirulence activity. In total, 171 metabolites from different classes were 
annotated and principal component analysis revealed higher levels of phenolics 
and glucosinolates in var. integrifolia leaves and color discrimination, whereas 
fatty acids were enriched in var. rugosa, particularly trihydroxy 
octadecadienoic acid. All extracts demonstrated significant antibacterial 
activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis, presenting the 
IR leaves the highest antihemolytic activity against S. aureus (99 % 
inhibition), followed by RR (84 %), IG (82 %), and RG (37 %) leaves. 
Antivirulence of IR leaves was further validated by reduction in alpha-hemolysin 
gene transcription (∼4-fold). Using various multivariate data analyses, 
compounds positively correlated to bioactivity, primarily phenolic compounds, 
glucosinolates, and isothiocyanates, were also identified.

Liraglutide Lowers Endothelial Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1 in Murine 
Atherosclerosis Independent of Glucose Levels.

Hofmann G(1), Wyttenbach S(1), Rolin B(2), Nyberg M(2), Kaufmann BA(1)(3).

The authors determined the effect of the GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide on 
endothelial surface expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 in 
murine apolipoprotein E knockout atherosclerosis. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound 
molecular imaging using microbubbles targeted to VCAM-1 and control microbubbles 
showed a 3-fold increase in endothelial surface VCAM-1 signal in vehicle-treated 
animals, whereas in the liraglutide-treated animals the signal ratio remained 
around 1 throughout the study. Liraglutide had no influence on low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol or glycated hemoglobin, but reduced TNF-α, IL-1β, MCP-1, 
and OPN. Aortic plaque lesion area and luminal VCAM-1 expression on 
immunohistology were reduced under liraglutide treatment.

Hyperpolarizabilities of Push-Pull Chromophores in Solution: Interplay between 
Electronic and Vibrational Contributions.

Hrivnák T(1), Medveď M(2)(3), Bartkowiak W(4), Zaleśny R(5).

Contemporary design of new organic non-linear optical (NLO) materials relies to 
a large extent on the understanding of molecular and electronic 
structure-property relationships revealed during the years by available 
computational approaches. The progress in theory-hand-in-hand with 
experiment-has enabled us to identify and analyze various physical aspects 
affecting the NLO responses, such as the environmental effects, molecular 
vibrations, frequency dispersion, and system dynamics. Although it is nowadays 
possible to reliably address these effects separately, the studies analyzing 
their mutual interplay are still very limited. Here, we employ density 
functional theory (DFT) methods in combination with an implicit solvent model to 
examine the solvent effects on the electronic and harmonic as well as anharmonic 
vibrational contributions to the static first hyperpolarizability of a series of 
push-pull α,ω-diphenylpolyene oligomers, which were experimentally shown to 
exhibit notable second-order NLO responses. We demonstrate that the magnitudes 
of both vibrational and electronic contributions being comparable in the gas 
phase significantly increase in solvents, and the enhancement can be, in some 
cases, as large as three- or even four-fold. The electrical and mechanical 
anharmonic contributions are not negligible but cancel each other out to a large 
extent. The computed dynamic solute NLO properties of the studied systems are 
shown to be in a fair agreement with those derived from experimentally measured 
electric-field-induced second-harmonic generation (EFISHG) signals. Our results 
substantiate the necessity to consider concomitantly both solvation and 
vibrational effects in modeling static NLO properties of solvated systems.

Structural Dynamics and Activity of B19V VP1u during the pHs of Cell Entry and 
Endosomal Trafficking.

Lakshmanan RV(1), Hull JA(1), Berry L(2), Burg M(1), Bothner B(2), McKenna R(1), 
Agbandje-McKenna M(1).

Parvovirus B19 (B19V) is a human pathogen that is the causative agent of fifth 
disease in children. It is also known to cause hydrops in fetuses, anemia in 
AIDS patients, and transient aplastic crisis in patients with sickle cell 
disease. The unique N-terminus of Viral Protein 1 (VP1u) of parvoviruses, 
including B19V, exhibits phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity, which is required for 
endosomal escape. Presented is the structural dynamics of B19V VP1u under 
conditions that mimic the pHs of cell entry and endosomal trafficking to the 
nucleus. Using circular dichroism spectroscopy, the receptor-binding domain of 
B19V VP1u is shown to exhibit an α-helical fold, whereas the PLA2 domain 
exhibits a probable molten globule state, both of which are pH invariant. 
Differential scanning calorimetry performed at endosomal pHs shows that the 
melting temperature (Tm) of VP1u PLA2 domain is tuned to body temperature (37 
°C) at pH 7.4. In addition, PLA2 assays performed at temperatures ranging from 
25-45 °C show both a temperature and pH-dependent change in activity. We 
hypothesize that VP1u PLA2 domain differences in Tm at differing pHs have 
enabled the virus to "switch on/off" the phospholipase activity during capsid 
trafficking. Furthermore, we propose the environment of the early endosome as 
the optimal condition for endosomal escape leading to B19V infection.

Karrikin signaling regulates hypocotyl shade avoidance response by modulating 
auxin homeostasis in Arabidopsis.

Xu P(#)(1), Jinbo H(#)(1)(2), Cai W(1).

Shade affects all aspects of plant growth and development, including seed 
germination, hypocotyl elongation, petiole growth, leaf hyponasty, and flowering 
time. Here, we found that mutations in the key Arabidopsis karrikins signal 
perception-associated KARRIKIN INSENSITIVE 2 (KAI2) gene, encoding an α/β-fold 
hydrolase, and the MORE AXILLARY GROWTH 2 (MAX2) gene, encoding an F-box 
protein, led to greater hypocotyl elongation under shade avoidance conditions. 
We further verified that these phenotypes were caused by perception of the 
endogenous KAI2-ligands (KLs), and that this phenotype is independent of 
strigolactone biosynthetic or signaling pathways. Upon perception of a KL, it is 
probable that the target protein forms a complex with the KAI2/MAX2 proteins, 
which are degraded through the action of the 26S proteasome. We demonstrated 
that SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2-1 (SMAX1) is the degradation target for the KAI2/MAX2 
complex in the context of shade avoidance. KAI2 and MAX2 require SMAX1 to limit 
the hypocotyl growth associated with shade avoidance. Treatment with 
l-kynurenine, an inhibitor of auxin accumulation, partially restored elongation 
of kai2 mutant hypocotyls under simulated shade. Furthermore, KAI2 is involved 
in regulating auxin accumulation and polar auxin transport, which may contribute 
to the hypocotyl shade response. In addition, SMAX1 gene overexpression promoted 
the hypocotyl shade response. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that 
SMAX1-overexpression affected the expression of many auxin homeostasis genes, 
especially under simulated shade. Altogether, our data support the conclusion 
that KL signaling regulates shade avoidance by modulating auxin homeostasis in 
the hypocotyl.

The elevated D-2-hydroxyglutarate level found as a characteristic metabolic 
change of colon cancer in both in vitro and in vivo models.

Atalay EB(1), Kayali HA(2).

The D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2-HG), whose normal cellular concentration is low, 
can be accumulated 10-100 times natural levels in some cancer types and 
participates in the carcinogenesis process. D-2-HG is produced by different 
pathways specific to cancer type. In this study, the level of significant 
metabolites produced in some metabolic pathways related to D-2-HG in the energy 
metabolism was determined in colon adenocarcinoma cell lines at different 
stages. Then, the differences in TCA and Cori cycle, glutaminolysis, and 
Glycolysis were investigated in the brain, colon, liver, and tumor tissues 
extracted from xenograft models. The levels of glucose, pyruvate, lactate, all 
TCA cycle intermediates, and D-2-HG were determined by the HPLC analysis, DNS 
method, and pyruvate assay. The intracellular D-2-HG level was found at 
22.6 μmol/mg in primary (Caco-2) and 152.6 μmol/mg in metastatic (SW620) colon 
adenocarcinoma cells, whereas it could not be detected in colon epithelial cell 
line (CCD-18Co). In the xenograft models, D-2-HG could not be detected in 
CCD-18Co colon and brain tissues, whereas it was produced in Caco-2 and SW620 
tissues. Most importantly, the level of D-2-HG was 7.4 and 19.9-fold increased 
in Caco-2 and SW620 tumor tissues compared to healthy tissue, respectively. In 
addition, the D-2-HG production pathways were investigated. The results revealed 
that the carbon source of D-2-HG is glucose, and the imbalance of wt-IDH1/2 
enzymes plays a role in its production. Overall, the in vitro and in vivo 
results show that the enhanced production of endogenous D-2-HG is a 
characteristic change in the metabolism of colon cancer.

A typhoid fever protein capsular matrix vaccine candidate formulated with 
Advax-CpG adjuvant induces a robust and durable anti-typhoid Vi polysaccharide 
antibody response in mice, rabbits and nonhuman primates.

Honda-Okubo Y(1), Cartee RT(2), Thanawastien A(2), Seung Yang J(3), Killeen 
KP(2), Petrovsky N(4).

Typhax is an investigational typhoid fever vaccine candidate that is comprised 
of Vi polysaccharide from Salmonella enterica serovar typhi (S. Typhi) 
non-covalently entrapped in a glutaraldehyde catalyzed, cross-linked 
α-poly-L-lysine and CRM197 protein matrix. A previous Phase 1 trial of an 
aluminum phosphate adjuvanted Typhax formulation showed it induced Vi IgG after 
a single dose but that subsequent doses failed to further boost Vi IgG levels. 
The current study asked whether Advax-CpG adjuvant might instead be able to 
overcome polysaccharide-induced immune inhibition and improve Typhax 
immunogenicity. Advax-CpG adjuvanted Typhax elicited high and sustained Vi IgG 
responses in mice, rabbits and non-human primates (NHP) with levels being 
boosted by repeated immunization. High Vi antibody responses were lost in 
CD4 + T cell depleted mice confirming that despite the lack of conjugation of 
the polysaccharide to the carrier protein, Typhax nevertheless acts in a T cell 
dependent manner, explaining its ability to induce long-term B cell memory 
responses to Vi capable of being boosted. In NHP, Advax-CpG adjuvanted Typhax 
induced up to 100-fold higher Vi IgG levels than the commercial Typhim Vi 
polysaccharide vaccine. Typhax induced high and sustained serum bactericidal 
activity against S. Typhi and stimulated robust Vi IgG responses even in animals 
previously primed with a pure polysaccharide vaccine. Hence Advax-CpG adjuvanted 
Typhax vaccine is a highly promising candidate to provide robust and durable 
protection against typhoid fever.

Comment in
    Hepatology. 2022 Oct;76(4):E74-E75.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Histopathological examination is the gold standard for 
detection of gallstone (GS) or gallbladder carcinoma (CAGB). Bile concentrated 
in the gallbladder (GB) is expected to recapitulate metagenomics and molecular 
changes associated with development of CAGB.
APPROACH AND RESULTS: Bile samples were screened for lipidomics and metaproteome 
(metagenomics) signatures capable of early detection of cancer in GB anomalies. 
Analysis of the training cohort (n = 87) showed that metastability of bile was 
reduced in CAGB (p < 0.05). CAGB bile showed significant alteration of lipidome 
and microbiome as indicated by multivariate partial least squares regression 
analysis and alpha-diversity and beta-diversity indexes (p < 0.05). Significant 
reduction of lipid species and increase in bacterial taxa were found to be 
associated with patients with CAGB, CAGB with GS, and GS (p < 0.05, log fold 
change >1.5). A multimodular correlation network created using weighted 
lipid/metaproteomic correlation network analysis showed striking associations 
between lipid and metaproteomic modules and functionality. CAGB-linked 
metaproteomic modules/functionality directly correlated with lipid modules, 
species, clinical parameters, and bile acid profile (p < 0.05). Increased 
bacterial taxa (Leptospira, Salmonella enterica, Mycoplasma gallisepticum) and 
their functionality showed a direct correlation with lipid classes such as 
lysophosphatidylinositol, ceramide 1-phosphate, and lysophosphatidylethanolamine 
and development of CAGB (r2  > 0.85). Lipid/metaproteomic signature-based 
probability of detection for CAGB was > 90%, whereas that for GS was > 80% 
(p < 0.05). Validation of eight lipid species using four machine learning 
algorithms in two separate cohorts (n = 38; bile [test cohort 1] and paired 
plasma [test cohort 2]) showed accuracy (99%) and sensitivity/specificity (>98%) 
for CAGB detection.
CONCLUSIONS: Bile samples of patients with CAGB showed significant reduction in 
lipid species and increase in bacterial taxa. Our study identifies a core set of 
bile lipidome and metaproteome signatures which may offer universal utility for 
early diagnosis of CAGB.

SCOPE: Red meat is a staple food of Western diets, but it can also induce 
IgE-mediated allergic reactions. Yet, apart from the heat-labile protein serum 
albumin and the carbohydrate α-Gal, the molecules involved in allergic reactions 
to red meat remain unknown.
METHODS AND RESULTS: IgE reactivity profiles of beef-sensitized individuals were 
analyzed by IgE-immunoblotting with protein extracts from raw and cooked beef. 
IgE-reactive proteins were identified by peptide mass fingerprinting. Bovine 
myosin light chains (MYLs) were produced recombinantly. IgE reactivity of the 
recombinant allergens was analyzed by ELISA and the molecules' fold evaluated by 
circular dichroism analysis. The stability of the proteins to gastrointestinal 
digestion was investigated in vitro. The transport of recombinant myosin light 
chain 1 (rMYL1) through the intestinal epithelium was evaluated by exposing a 
monolayer of Caco-2 cells to rMYL1. Two IgE-reactive proteins were identified as 
myosin light chain 1 (MYL1) and myosin light chain 3 (MYL3) in the cooked-beef 
extract and were designated Bos d 13 isoallergens. rMYL1 and rMYL3 represent 
folded, IgE reactive proteins and they both display remarkable thermal 
stability. rMYL1 showed higher resistance to gastrointestinal digestion than 
rMYL3 and was able to cross a monolayer of intestinal cells without disturbing 
the integrity of the tight junctions, suggesting the sensitizing capacity of 
MYL1.
CONCLUSION: MYLs were identified as novel heat-stable bovine meat allergens.

Discovery and development of benzene sulfonamide derivatives as anti-hepatic 
fibrosis agents.

N(1), Wang J(3), He H(4), Wang Y(5).

A novel benzene sulfonamide compound named IMB16-4 exhibits excellent 
anti-hepatic fibrosis activity in a recent study. To develop potential 
anti-hepatic fibrosis agents, a series of benzene sulfonamide derivatives were 
designed and synthesized based on the scaffold of the lead compound IMB16-4. As 
it turned out, most of the derivatives displayed potential anti-hepatic fibrosis 
activity, among which, compounds 11a, 11b, 11d, 13a, 36b, and 47b exhibited 
inhibition rates of 42.3%, 48.7%, 42.4%, 40.0%, 39.4%, and 49.3%, respectively, 
which were equivalent to the control IMB16-4 with an inhibition rate of 35.9%, 
Costunolide with an inhibition rate of 45.4%, and much more potent than that of 
Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) with an inhibition rate of 25.3%. Especially, 
compounds 46a, 46b, and 46c exhibited excellent anti-hepatic fibrosis activity 
with inhibition rates of 61.7%, 54.8%, and 60.7%, which were almost 1.5-fold 
inhibition rates of IMB16-4. In addition, compounds 46a, 46b, and 46c exhibited 
remarkable inhibitory activity in the gene expression of COL1A1, MMP-2, and the 
protein expression of COL1A1, FN, α-SMA, and TIMP-1 by inhibiting the 
JAK1-STAT1/3 pathway. These findings furnished valuable inspiration for the 
further development of anti-hepatic fibrosis agents.

Structural Modelling of Platelet Activating Factor Acetyl Hydrolase in 
Leishmania donovani, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Trypanosoma brucei: Implications on 
Therapeutics for Leishmaniasis, Chagas Disease, and Sleeping Sickness.

Goswami A(1), Koley T(1), Rajan MV(1), Madhuri P(1), Upadhyay N(1), Das U(1), 
Kumar M(1), Ethayathulla AS(1), Hariprasad G(1).

PURPOSE: Leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, and sleeping sickness are caused by 
protozoa Leishmania donovani, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Trypanosoma brucei, 
respectively. Platelet activating factor acetyl hydrolase (PAF-AH) is an 
inflammatory protein implicated in pathogenesis of these three infections, 
thereby making them attractive drug targets.
METHODS: PAF-AH sequences were retrieved from UniProt and aligned using Clustal 
Omega. Homologous models of parasitic proteins were built based on crystal 
structure of human PAF-AH and validated using PROCHECK server. Volumes of 
substrate-binding channel were calculated using the ProteinsPlus program. High 
throughput virtual screening using Glide program in Schrodinger was done with 
ZINC drug library against parasitic PAF-AH enzymes. Complexes with best hits 
were energy-minimized and subjected to 100 ns molecular dynamic simulation and 
analyzed.
RESULTS: PAF-AH enzyme sequences from protozoa Leishmania donovani, Trypanosoma 
cruzi, Trypanosoma brucei, and human have a minimum of 34% sequence similarity 
with each other. Corresponding structures show a globular conformation 
consisting of twisted β-pleated sheets, flanked by α-helices on either side. 
Catalytic triad of serine-histidine-aspartate is conserved. Substrate-binding 
channel residues are conserved to an extent, with a lower channel volume in 
human as compared to target enzymes. Drug screening resulted in identification 
of three molecules that had better affinities than the substrate to the target 
enzymes. These molecules fulfill Lipinski's rules for drug likeness and also 
bind with less affinity to the human counterpart, thereby establishing a high 
selective index.
CONCLUSION: Structures of PAF-AH from protozoan parasites and humans belong to 
the same family of enzymes and have a similar three-dimensional fold. However, 
they show subtle variations in residue composition, secondary structure 
composition, substrate-binding channel volume, and conformational stability. 
These differences result in certain specific molecules being potent inhibitors 
of the target enzymes while simultaneously having weaker binding to human 
homologue.

Impaired gating of γ- and ε-AChR respectively causes Escobar syndrome and 
fast-channel myasthenia.

Shen XM(1), Nakata T(2)(3), Mizuno S(4), Imoto I(5), Selcen D(1), Ohno K(2), 
Engel AG(1).

OBJECTIVE: To dissect the kinetic defects of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) γ 
subunit variant in an incomplete form of the Escobar syndrome without pterygium 
and compare it with those of a variant of corresponding residue in the AChR ε 
subunit in a congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS).
METHODS: Whole exome sequencing, α-bungarotoxin binding assay, single channel 
patch-clamp recordings, and maximum likelihood analysis of channel kinetics.
RESULTS: We identified compound heterozygous variants in AChR γ and ε subunits 
in three Escobar syndrome (1-3) and three CMS patients (4-6), respectively. Each 
Escobar syndrome patient carries γP121R along with γV221Afs*44 in patients 1 and 
2, and γY63* in patient 3. Three CMS patients share εP121T along with εR20W, 
εG-8R, and εY15H in patients 4, 5, and 6, respectively. Surface expressions of 
γP121R- and εP121T-AChR were 80% and 138% of the corresponding wild-type AChR, 
whereas εR20W, εG-8R, and εY15H reduced receptor expression to 27%, 35%, and 30% 
of wild-type εAChR, respectively. γV221Afs*44 and γY63* are null variants. Thus, 
γP121R and εP121T determine the phenotype. γP121R and εP121T shorten channel 
opening burst duration to 28% and 18% of corresponding wild-type AChR by 
reducing the channel gating equilibrium constant 44- and 63-fold, respectively.
INTERPRETATION: Similar impairment of channel gating efficiency of a 
corresponding P121 residue in the acetylcholine-binding site of the AChR γ and ε 
subunits causes Escobar syndrome without pterygium and fast-channel CMS, 
respectively, suggesting that therapy for the fast-channel CMS will benefit 
Escobar syndrome.

Graph regularized non-negative matrix factorization with prior knowledge 
consistency constraint for drug-target interactions prediction.

Zhang J(1), Xie M(2)(3).

BACKGROUND: Identifying drug-target interactions (DTIs) plays a key role in drug 
development. Traditional wet experiments to identify DTIs are expensive and time 
consuming. Effective computational methods to predict DTIs are useful to narrow 
the searching scope of potential drugs and speed up the process of drug 
discovery. There are a variety of non-negativity matrix factorization based 
methods to predict DTIs, but the convergence of the algorithms used in the 
matrix factorization are often overlooked and the results can be further 
improved.
RESULTS: In order to predict DTIs more accurately and quickly, we propose an 
alternating direction algorithm to solve graph regularized non-negative matrix 
factorization with prior knowledge consistency constraint (ADA-GRMFC). Based on 
known DTIs, drug chemical structures and target sequences, ADA-GRMFC at first 
constructs a DTI matrix, a drug similarity matrix and a target similarity 
matrix. Then DTI prediction is modeled as the non-negative factorization of the 
DTI matrix with graph dual regularization terms and a prior knowledge 
consistency constraint. The graph dual regularization terms are used to 
integrate the information from the drug similarity matrix and the target 
similarity matrix, and the prior knowledge consistency constraint is used to 
ensure the matrix decomposition result should be consistent with the prior 
knowledge of known DTIs. Finally, an alternating direction algorithm is used to 
solve the matrix factorization. Furthermore, we prove that the algorithm can 
converge to a stationary point. Extensive experimental results of 10-fold 
cross-validation show that ADA-GRMFC has better performance than other 
state-of-the-art methods. In the case study, ADA-GRMFC is also used to predict 
the targets interacting with the drug olanzapine, and all of the 10 
highest-scoring targets have been accurately predicted. In predicting drug 
interactions with target estrogen receptors alpha, 17 of the 20 highest-scoring 
drugs have been validated.

Vitamin D Supplementation Has No Impact on Cardiorespiratory Fitness, but 
Improves Inflammatory Status in Vitamin D Deficient Young Men Engaged in 
Resistance Training.

Savolainen L(1), Timpmann S(1), Mooses M(1), Medijainen L(1), Tõnutare L(1), 
Ross F(1), Lellsaar M(1), Piir A(2), Zilmer M(2), Unt E(3)(4)(5), Ööpik V(1).

Data on the effect of vitamin D (Vit-D) supplementation on cardiorespiratory 
fitness (VO2max) are conflicting. A possible source of discrepancies in the 
literature is the heterogeneity in baseline Vit-D status among participants in 
previous studies. The main objectives of the present study were to assess the 
impact of Vit-D supplementation on VO2max and inflammatory status in Vit-D 
deficient young healthy men. Participants (n = 39, baseline serum Vit-D level < 
50 nmol/L) were quasi-randomly assigned to one of the two groups, which, in a 
double-blind manner, supplemented their diet daily with either Vit-D (8000 IU; 
VD) or placebo (PLC) and concomitantly performed a 12-week supervised resistance 
training program. During the 12-week intervention, serum Vit-D concentrations 
increased 3.9-fold (p < 0.001) in the VD group while no changes occurred in the 
PLC group. Baseline VO2max did not differ in the two groups and remained 
unchanged during the intervention. Serum interleukin-10/tumour necrosis factor 
alpha ratio increased significantly (30%, p = 0.007; effect size 0.399) in VD 
but not in PLC group. In conclusion, 12-week Vit-D supplementation increases 
serum 25(OH)D levels and improves inflammatory status, but has no impact on 
VO2max in Vit-D deficient young men engaged in resistance training.

Preparation and characterization of type 3 resistant starch by 
ultrasound-assisted autoclave gelatinization and its effect on steamed bread 
quality.

Liu X(1), Ma Q(2), Cheng D(1), Zhang F(1), Li Y(1), Wang W(3), Wang J(3), Sun 
J(4).

In this study, we aimed to establish an innovative and efficient preparation 
method of potato resistant starch (PRS). To achieve this, we prepared type 3 
resistant starch (RS3) from native potato starch (PS) using an ultrasonic method 
combined with autoclave gelatinization and optimized by the response surface 
method to study the structure and properties of potato RS3 (PRS3) and its effect 
on the quality of steamed bread. Under optimal treatment conditions, the PRS3 
content increased from 7.5% to 15.9%. Compared with PS, the B-type crystal 
structure of PRS3 was destroyed, and the content of hydroxyl groups was 
increased, but no new chemical groups were introduced. PRS3 had a rougher 
surface and a lower crystallinity, gelatinization temperature, viscosity, 
setback value, and breakdown value. The low content (5%) of PRS3 had a stable 
viscosity and was easily degraded by bacteria, which can improve the quality of 
steamed bread to a certain extent. When the PRS3 content was over 10%, it 
competed with the gluten protein to absorb water, which reduced the contents of 
β-turn and α-helix in the dough, increased the contents of β-fold, and weakened 
the structure of the gluten network. It also decreased the specific volume and 
elasticity of the steamed bread and increased the spreading rate, hardness, and 
chewiness. Steamed bread prepared with a flour mixture containing 5% PRS3 was 
similar to the presidential acceptance of control flour. In this study, a new 
sustainable and efficient PRS3 preparation method was established, which has 
certain guiding significance for the processing of Functional steamed bread with 
high-resistant starch.

Study of the Pollen Grain Metabolome under Deposition of Nitrogen and Phosphorus 
in Taxus baccata L. and Juniperus communis L.

Pers-Kamczyc E(1), Kamczyc J(2).

Nitrogen plays an important role in both quantitative and qualitative aspects of 
plant reproduction, including pollen grain compounds and seed production. Recent 
studies have pointed out that pollen grains produced by male plants of T. 
baccata and J. communis subjected to a long period of fertilizer supplementation 
have lower in vitro germination ability and higher nitrogen content. To gain 
molecular insights into these observations, we conducted GC-MS analysis of both 
species to characterize the metabolomes of dry, mature pollen grains, which 
allowed for the identification and quantification of more than 200 metabolites. 
The results demonstrated that fertilizer supplementation impacts the relative 
content of 14 metabolites in J. communis (9 downregulated and 5 upregulated) and 
21 in T. baccata (6 downregulated and 15 upregulated). Although plants showed 
little similarity in patterns, in metabolite profiles, both up and down 
fold-changes were observed. This is the first report on the gymnosperm pollen 
grain metabolomic profile and changes induced by long-term nitrogen and 
phosphorus supplementation. Pollen grains produced by fertilizer-supplemented 
male individuals had significantly lower relative content of linolenic acid, 
5,6-dihydrouracil, maltotriose, galactonic acid, D-xylulose, and 
glycerol-α-phosphate but higher content of sorbitol, glucosamine, and 
1,5-anhydro-D-glucitol as well as n-acetyl-d-hexosamine, dimethyl phthalate, 
glycine, galactose-6-phosphate, D-fructose-6-phosphate, pyroglutamic acid, and 
3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3-hydroxypropionic acid. Thus, in pollen grain samples 
earlier shown to have different germination abilities, the presence of different 
metabolites indicates a significant environmental impact on the quality of 
gymnosperm pollen grains.

A metabolomics study: Could plasma metabolites be a guide for the prevention of 
tamsulosin side effects?

Akman TC(1), Kadioglu Y(2), Senol O(3), Erkayman B(4).

BACKGROUND: The understanding of precision medicine, which aims for high 
efficacy and low toxicity in treatments, has gained more importance with omics 
technologies. In this study, it was aimed to reach new suggestions for 
low-toxicity treatment by clarifying the relationship between tamsulosin side 
effects and metabolome profiles.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plasma samples of control and tamsulosin-treated rats 
were analyzed by LC-Q-TOF/MS/MS. MS/MS data was processed in XCMS software for 
the identification of metabolite and metabolic pathway analysis. Data were 
classified with MATLAB 2019b for multivariate data analysis. 34m/z values were 
found to be significantly different between the drug and control groups (P≤0.01 
and fold analysis≥1.5) and identified by comparing METLIN and HMDB databases.
RESULTS: According to multivariate data analysis, α-Linolenic Acid, Thiamine, 
Retinoic acid, 1.25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3-26.23-Lactone, L-Glutamine, L-Serine, 
Retinaldehyde, Sphingosine 1-phosphate, L-Lysine, 23S.25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3, 
Sphinganine, L-Cysteine, Uridine 5'-diphosphate, Calcidiol, L-Tryptophan, 
L-Alanine levels changed significantly compared to the control group. 
Differences in the metabolisms of Retinol, Sphingolipid, 
Alanine-Aspartate-Glutamate, Glutathione, Fatty Acid, Tryptophan, and 
biosynthesis of Aminoacyl-tRNA, and Unsaturated Fatty Acid have been 
successfully demonstrated by metabolic pathway analysis. According to our study, 
vitamin A and D supplements can be recommended to prevent side effects such as 
asthenia, rhinitis, nasal congestion, dizziness and IFIS in the treatment of 
tamsulosin. Alteration of aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and sphingolipid 
metabolism pathways during tamsulosin treatment is effective in the occurrence 
of nasal congestion.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides important information for tamsulosin therapy 
with high efficacy and low side effects in precision medicine.

RNA sequencing suggests that non-coding RNAs play a role in the development of 
acquired haemophilia.

Tigu AB(1)(2), Hotea I(3), Drula R(1)(2), Zimta AA(1), Dirzu N(1), Santa M(3), 
Constantinescu C(3), Dima D(4), Bergthorsson JT(5), Greiff V(6), Gulei D(1), 
Coriu D(7), Serban M(8), Mahlangu J(9), Tomuleasa C(1)(2).

Acquired haemophilia (AH) is a rare disorder characterized by bleeding in 
patients with no personal or family history of coagulation/clotting-related 
diseases. This disease occurs when the immune system, by mistake, generates 
autoantibodies that target FVIII, causing bleeding. Small RNAs from plasma 
collected from AH patients (n = 2), mild classical haemophilia (n = 3), severe 
classical haemophilia (n = 3) and healthy donors (n = 2), for sequencing by 
Illumina, NextSeq500. Based on bioinformatic analysis, AH patients were compared 
to all experimental groups and a significant number of altered transcripts were 
identified with one transcript being modified compared to all groups at fold 
change level. The Venn diagram shows that haemoglobin subunit alpha 1 was 
highlighted to be the common upregulated transcript in AH compared to classical 
haemophilia and healthy patients. Non-coding RNAs might play a role in AH 
pathogenesis; however, due to the rarity of HA, the current study needs to be 
translated on a larger number of AH samples and classical haemophilia samples to 
generate more solid data that can confirm our findings.

Discovery of andrographolide hit analog as a potent cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor 
through consensus MD-simulation, electrostatic potential energy simulation and 
ligand efficiency metrics.

Jain P(1), Satija J(2), Sudandiradoss C(3).

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is the key enzyme responsible for the conversion of 
arachidonic acid to prostaglandins that display pro-inflammatory properties and 
thus, it is a potential target protein to develop anti-inflammatory drugs. In 
this study, chemical and bio-informatics approaches have been employed to find a 
novel potent andrographolide (AGP) analog as a COX-2 inhibitor having better 
pharmacological properties than aspirin and rofecoxib (controls). The full amino 
acid sequenced human Alpha fold (AF) COX-2 protein (604AA) was selected and 
validated for its accuracy against the reported COX-2 protein structures (PDB 
ID: 5F19, 5KIR, 5F1A, 5IKQ and 1V0X) followed by multiple sequence alignment 
analysis to establish the sequence conservation. The systematic virtual 
screening of 237 AGP analogs against AF-COX-2 protein yielded 22 lead compounds 
based on the binding energy score (< - 8.0 kcal/mol). These were further 
screened out to 7 analogs by molecular docking analysis and investigated further 
for ADMET prediction, ligand efficiency metrics calculations, quantum mechanical 
analysis, MD simulation, electrostatic potential energy (EPE) docking 
simulation, and MM/GBSA. In-depth analysis revealed that AGP analog A3 
(3-[2-[(1R,4aR,5R,6R,8aR)-6-hydroxy-5,6,8a-trimethyl-2-methylidene-3,4,4a,5,7,8-hexahydro-1H-naphthalen-1-yl]ethylidene]-4-hydroxyoxolan-2-one) 
forms the most stable complex with the AF-COX-2 showing the least RMSD value 
(0.37 ± 0.03 nm), a good number of hydrogen bonds (protein-ligand H-bond = 11, 
and protein H-bond = 525), minimum EPE score (- 53.81 kcal/mol), and lowest 
MM-GBSA before and after simulation (- 55.37 and - 56.25 kcal/mol, respectively) 
value compared to other analogs and controls. Thus, we suggest that the 
identified A3 AGP analog could be developed as a promising plant-based 
anti-inflammatory drug by inhibiting COX-2.

Protective Effect of Glycomacropeptide on the Inflammatory Response of U937 
Macrophages.

Córdova-Dávalos LE(1), Cervantes-García D(1)(2), Ballona-Alba MF(1), 
Santos-López A(1), Esquivel-Basaldúa AS(1), Gallegos-Alcalá P(1), Jiménez M(1), 
Salinas E(1).

Macrophages play crucial roles in inflammation and oxidative stress associated 
with noncommunicable diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and 
cancer. Glycomacropeptide (GMP) is a bioactive peptide derived from milk 
κ-casein that contains abundant sialic acid and has shown anti-inflammatory, 
antioxidative, anti-obesity, and anti-diabetic properties when is orally 
administered. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of GMP on the 
regulation of the inflammatory response in human macrophages and the 
participation of sialic acid in this activity. GMP pretreatment decreased by 
35%, 35%, and 49% the production of nitrites, interleukin (IL)-1β, and tumor 
necrosis factor (TNF)-α, respectively, in activated human macrophages U937. The 
same effect was obtained when cells were pretreated with asialo GMP, and no 
change on the gene expression of the lectins associated with the recognition of 
sialic acids, SIGLEC5, 7, and 9, was induced by GMP on macrophages, which 
suggests that sialic acid might not be involved in this immunoregulatory effect. 
Interestingly, GMP increased 8.9- and 3.5-fold the gene expression of the 
canonical anti-inflammatory protein SOCS3 and the antioxidant enzyme HMOX1, 
respectively, in U937 cells. Thus, GMP exerts anti-inflammatory and 
antioxidative activities on activated macrophages in a sialic acid-independent 
manner, which might be related to its in vivo reported bioactivity.

Polyvalent Glycan Functionalized Quantum Nanorods as Mechanistic Probes for 
Shape-Selective Multivalent Lectin-Glycan Recognition.

Hooper J(1), Budhadev D(2), Fernandez Ainaga DL(3), Hondow N(3), Zhou D(2), Guo 
Y(1).

Multivalent lectin-glycan interactions (MLGIs) are widespread in biology and 
hold the key to many therapeutic applications. However, the underlying 
structural and biophysical mechanisms for many MLGIs remain poorly understood, 
limiting our ability to design glycoconjugates to potently target specific MLGIs 
for therapeutic intervention. Glycosylated nanoparticles have emerged as a 
powerful biophysical probe for MLGIs, although how nanoparticle shape affects 
the MLGI molecular mechanisms remains largely unexplored. Herein, we have 
prepared fluorescent quantum nanorods (QRs), densely coated with 
α-1,2-manno-biose ligands (QR-DiMan), as multifunctional probes to investigate 
how scaffold geometry affects the MLGIs of a pair of closely related, tetrameric 
viral receptors, DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR. We have previously shown that a 
DiMan-capped spherical quantum dot (QD-DiMan) gives weak cross-linking 
interactions with DC-SIGNR but strong simultaneous binding with DC-SIGN. Against 
the elongated QR-DiMan, DC-SIGN retains similarly strong simultaneous binding of 
all four binding sites with a single QR-DiMan (apparent K d ≈ 0.5 nM, ∼1.8 
million-fold stronger than the corresponding monovalent binding), while DC-SIGNR 
gives both weak cross-linking and strong individual binding interactions, 
resulting in a larger binding affinity enhancement than that with QD-DiMan. 
S/TEM analysis of QR-DiMan-lectin assemblies reveals that DC-SIGNR's different 
binding modes arise from the different nanosurface curvatures of the QR 
scaffold. The glycan display at the spherical ends presents too high a steric 
barrier for DC-SIGNR to bind with all four binding sites; thus, it cross-links 
between two QR-DiMan to maximize binding multivalency, whereas the more planar 
character of the cylindrical center allows the glycans to bridge all binding 
sites in DC-SIGNR. This work thus establishes glycosylated QRs as a powerful 
biophysical probe for MLGIs not only to provide quantitative binding affinities 
and binding modes but also to demonstrate the specificity of multivalent lectins 
in discriminating different glycan displays in solution, dictated by the 
scaffold curvature.

Identification of cytoskeletal proteins as binding partners of Bri2 BRICHOS 
domain.

Shimozawa M(1), Tigro H(2), Biverstål H(3), Shevchenko G(4), Bergquist J(4), 
Moaddel R(5), Johansson J(3), Nilsson P(6).

Proteins must fold into three-dimensional structures to execute their biological 
functions. Therefore, maintenance of protein homeostasis, proteostasis, 
including prevention of protein misfolding is essential for cellular activity 
and health. Molecular chaperones are key actors in proteostasis. BRICHOS domain 
is an intramolecular chaperone that also interferes with several 
aggregation-prone proteins including amyloid β (Aβ), involved in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). To extend the knowledge about Bri2 BRICHOS interactome we here 
used recombinant human (rh) Bri2 BRICHOS-mCherry fusion protein to probe for 
potential binding partners. Firstly, exogenously added Bri2 BRICHOS-mCherry was 
used to stain brain sections of wildtype and amyloid precursor protein (App) 
knock-in AD mice exhibiting robust Aβ pathology. Unexpectedly, we found that rh 
Bri2 BRICHOS-mCherry stained the cytoplasm of neurons which are devoid of Aβ 
deposits. To identify these intraneuronal proteins that bind to the rh Bri2 
BRICHOS domain, we performed co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) of mouse brain 
hippocampi homogenates using the Bri2 BRICHOS-mCherry probe and analyzed co-IP 
proteins by LC-MS/MS. This identified several cytoskeletal proteins including 
spectrin alpha and beta chain, drebrin, tubulin β3, and β-actin as binding 
partners. The interactions were confirmed by a second round of pulldown 
experiments using rh Bri2 BRICHOS linked to magnetic beads. The interaction of 
rh Bri2 BRICHOS and tubulin β3 was further investigated by staining both mouse 
brain sections and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells with rh Bri2 BRICHOS-mCherry and 
tubulin β3 immunostaining, which revealed partial co-localization. These data 
suggest a possible interplay of extracellular chaperone Bri2 BRICHOS domain in 
the intracellular space including the cytoskeleton.

Serum immune profiling in pediatric Crohn's disease demonstrates stronger immune 
modulation with first-line infliximab than conventional therapy and 
pre-treatment profiles predict clinical response to both treatments.

RHC(2), van Pieterson M(1), Li Y(3), Escher JC(1), de Ridder L(1), Samsom JN(2).

BACKGROUND: Despite its efficacy, rational guidance for starting/stopping 
first-line biologic treatment in individual pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) 
patients is needed. We assessed how serum immune profiles before and after 
first-line infliximab (FL-IFX) or conventional (CONV) induction therapy 
associate with disease remission at week 52.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: pre- (n=86), and 10-14 week post-treatment (n=84) sera 
were collected from patients with moderate-to-severe paediatric CD in the 
TISKids trial, randomised to FL-IFX (n=48; five 5 mg/kg infusions over 22 weeks) 
or CONV (n=43; exclusive enteral nutrition or oral prednisolone); both groups 
received azathioprine maintenance. The relative concentrations of 92 
inflammatory proteins were determined with Olink Proteomics; fold changes (FC) 
with |Log2FC|>0.5 after FDR adjustment were considered significant.
RESULTS: FL-IFX modulated a larger number of inflammatory proteins and induced 
stronger suppression than CONV; 18/30 proteins modulated by FL-IFX were not 
regulated by CONV. Hierarchical clustering based on IFX-modulated proteins at 
baseline revealed two clusters of patients: CD-hi patients had significantly 
higher concentrations of 23/30 IFX-modulated proteins (including oncostatin-M, 
TNFSF14, HGF, TGF-α) and higher clinical disease activity, CRP and blood 
neutrophils at baseline than CD-lo patients. Only 24% of CD-hi FL-IFX-treated 
patients maintained remission without escalation at week 52 vs 58% of CD-lo 
FL-IFX-treated patients. Similarly, 6% of CD-hi CONV-treated patients achieved 
remission vs 20% of CONV-treated CD-lo patients. Clustering based on immune 
profiles post-induction therapy did not relate to remission at week 52.
CONCLUSION: FL-IFX leads to stronger reductions and modulates more immune 
proteins than CONV. Stratification on pre-treatment profiles of IFX-modulated 
proteins directly relates to maintenance of remission without treatment 
escalation.

[Interferon-related gene array in predicting the efficacy of interferon therapy 
in chronic hepatitis B].

[Article in Chinese; Abstract available in Chinese from the publisher]

Wang J(1)(2), Lu J(1)(2), Zhou C(3), Du L(1)(2), Tang H(1)(2).

This study aims to clarify host factors of IFN treatment in the treatment of 
chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients by screening the differentially expressed 
genes of IFN pathway CHB patients with different response to interferon (IFN) 
therapy. Three cases were randomly selected in IFN-responding CHB patients (Rs), 
non-responding CHB patients (NRs) and healthy participants, respectively. The 
human type I IFN response RT 2 profiler PCR array was used to detect the 
expression levels of IFN-related genes in peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) 
from healthy participants and CHB patients before and after Peg-IFN-α 2a 
treatment. The results showed that more differentially expressed genes appeared 
in Rs group than NRs group after IFN treatment. Comparing with healthy 
participants, IFNG, IL7R, IRF1, and IRF8 were downregulated in both Rs and NRs 
group before IFN treatment; CXCL10, IFIT1, and IFITM1 were upregulated in the 
Rs; IL13RA1 and IFI35 were upregulated in the NRs, while IFRD2, IL11RA, IL4R, 
IRF3, IRF4, PYHIN1, and ADAR were downregulated. The expression of IL15, IFI35 
and IFI44 was downregulated by 4.09 ( t = 10.58, P < 0.001), 5.59 ( t = 3.37, P 
= 0.028) and 10.83 ( t = 2.8, P = 0.049) fold in the Rs group compared with the 
NRs group, respectively. In conclusion, IFN-response-related gene array is able 
to evaluate IFN treatment response by detecting IFN-related genes levels in 
PBMC. High expression of CXCL10, IFIT1 and IFITM1 before treatment may suggest 
satisfied IFN efficacy, while high expression of IL13RA1, IL15, IFI35 and IFI44 
molecules and low expression of IFRD2, IL11RA, IL4R, IRF3, IRF4, PYHIN1 and ADAR 
molecules may be associated with poor IFN efficacy.

本文旨在筛选干扰素（IFN）治疗应答不同的慢性乙型肝炎（CHB）患者间IFN通路的差异表达基因，明确IFN疗效不佳的可能宿主因素，并探索干扰素功能分类基因芯片在预测干扰素治疗CHB患者疗效中的应用前景。从我院干扰素治疗队列中随机选取有应答CHB患者（Rs）、无应答CHB患者（NRs）各3例，在健康体检者中招募受试者3例，利用IFN功能分类基因芯片检测Peg-IFN-α 
2a治疗前后CHB患者及健康对照者外周血单个核细胞（PBMCs）中IFN相关基因的表达水平。结果发现，与IFN治疗前相比，治疗后Rs组IFN通路相关的差异表达基因数量多于NRs组。与健康对照者相比，Rs和NRs在治疗前的IFNG、IL7R、IRF1和IRF8均下调；CXCL10、IFIT1、IFITM1在Rs中上调；IL13RA1和IFI35在NRs中上调，IFRD2、IL11RA、IL4R、IRF3、IRF4、PYHIN1和ADAR在NRs中下调。Rs组与NRs组相比，IL15、IFI35和IFI44分子的表达分别下调4.09（ 
t = 10.58， P < 0.001）、5.59（ t = 3.37， P = 0.028）和10.83（ t = 2.8， P = 
0.049）倍。综上，在接受Peg-IFN-α 
2a治疗的CHB患者中，IFN功能分类基因芯片能通过检测PBMC中的IFN相关基因表达水平评估治疗后IFN通路的激活情况，可用于预测IFN疗效；治疗前CXCL10、IFIT1和IFITM1的高表达可能提示IFN疗效良好；IL13RA1、IL15、IFI35和IFI44分子的高表达和IFRD2、IL11RA、IL4R、IRF3、IRF4、PYHIN1及ADAR分子的低表达可能提示患者IFN疗效不佳。.

The Formation of β-Strand Nine (β(9)) in the Folding and Insertion of BamA from 
an Unfolded Form into Lipid Bilayers.

Herwig S(1), Kleinschmidt JH(1)(2).

Transmembrane proteins span lipid bilayer membranes and serve essential 
functions in all living cells. Membrane-inserted domains are of either α-helical 
or β-barrel structure. Despite their biological importance, the biophysical 
mechanisms of the folding and insertion of proteins into membranes are not well 
understood. While the relative composition of the secondary structure has been 
examined by circular dichroism spectroscopy in folding studies for several outer 
membrane proteins, it is currently not known how individual β-strands fold. 
Here, the folding and insertion of the β-barrel assembly machinery protein A 
(BamA) from the outer membrane of Escherichia coli into lipid bilayers were 
investigated, and the formation of strand nine (β9) of BamA was examined. Eight 
single-cysteine mutants of BamA were overexpressed and isolated in unfolded form 
in 8 M urea. In each of these mutants, one of the residues of strand β9, from 
R572 to V579, was replaced by a cysteine and labeled with the fluorophore 
IAEDANS for site-directed fluorescence spectroscopy. Upon urea-dilution, the 
mutants folded into the native structure and were inserted into lipid bilayers 
of dilauroylphosphatidylcholine, similar to wild-type BamA. An aqueous and a 
membrane-adsorbed folding intermediate of BamA could be identified by strong 
shifts in the intensity maxima of the IAEDANS fluorescence of the labeled 
mutants of BamA towards shorter wavelengths, even in the absence of lipid 
bilayers. The shifts were greatest for membrane-adsorbed mutants and smaller for 
the inserted, folded mutants or the aqueous intermediates. The spectra of the 
mutants V573C-, L575C-, G577C-, and V579C-BamA, facing the lipid bilayer, 
displayed stronger shifts than the spectra recorded for the mutants R572C-, 
N574C-, T576C-, and K578C-BamA, facing the β-barrel lumen, in both the 
membrane-adsorbed form and the folded, inserted form. This alternating pattern 
was neither observed for the IAEDANS spectra of the unfolded forms nor for the 
water-collapsed forms, indicating that strand β9 forms in a membrane-adsorbed 
folding intermediate of BamA. The combination of cysteine scanning mutagenesis 
and site-directed fluorescence labeling is shown to be a valuable tool in 
examining the local secondary structure formation of transmembrane proteins.

Production of a Fungal Punicalagin-Degrading Enzyme by Solid-State Fermentation: 
Studies of Purification and Characterization.

Aguilar-Zárate P(1), Gutiérrez-Sánchez G(2), Michel MR(1), Bergmann CW(2), 
Buenrostro-Figueroa JJ(3), Ascacio-Valdés JA(4), Contreras-Esquivel JC(4), 
Aguilar CN(4).

The present work describes the purification of an enzyme capable of degrading 
punicalagin. The enzyme was produced by Aspergillus niger GH1 by solid-state 
fermentation, and the enzyme production was induced by using ellagitannins as 
the sole carbon source. The purification steps included the concentration by 
lyophilization, desalting, anionic exchange, and gel filtration chromatography. 
The enzyme kinetic constants were calculated by using punicalagin, methyl 
gallate, and sugar beet arabinans. The molecular mass of the protein was 
estimated by SDS-PAGE. The identified bands were excised and digested using 
trypsin, and the peptides were submitted to HPLC-MS/MS analysis. The docking 
analysis was conducted, and a 3D model was created. The purification fold 
increases 75 times compared with the cell-free extract. The obtained Km values 
were 0.053 mM, 0.53% and 6.66 mM for punicalagin, sugar beet arabinans and 
methyl gallate, respectively. The optimal pH and temperature for the reaction 
were 5 and 40 °C, respectively. The SDS-PAGE and native PAGE analysis revealed 
the presence of two bands identified as α-l-arabinofuranosidase. Both enzymes 
were capable of degrading punicalagin and releasing ellagic acid.

Sub-acute and sub-chronic toxicity assessment of the antimicrobial peptide 
Dermaseptin B2 on biochemical, haematological and histopathological parameters 
in BALB/c mice and Albino Wistar rats.

Abdille AA(1), Kitimu SR(1), Ndubi MM(1), Kimani J(2), Maina EN(1)(3), Bulimo 
W(4), Gavamukulya Y(5), Wamunyokoli F(1)(2).

BACKGROUND: Dermaseptins (Drs) are peptides found in the skin secretions of a 
variety of Hylid frogs, particularly those belonging to the Agalychnis and 
Phyllomedusa families. Dermaseptin B2 (Drs B2), an amphipathic, α-helical 
polypeptide was reported as the most active of the Dermaseptin B family. We have 
previously shown that Drs B2 has strong anti-proliferative activities against RD 
cells in vitro and thus required further evaluations for future medical 
applications.
AIM: The aim the study was to evaluate the 14-day sub-acute and 90-day 
sub-chronic toxicities Drs B2 in vivo.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: BALB/c mice were treated with increasing concentrations 
of 5-25 mg/kg of Drs B2. Rats were treated with 2, 4 and 10-fold concentrations 
of the calculated LD50 of Drs B2 following OECD recommendations. At the end of 
the experimentation periods, the animals were sacrificed and dissected to 
collect blood and selected organs for analysis of any effects caused by Drs B2 
treatment on the biochemical, haematological, and histological parameters.
RESULTS: The 14-day sub-acute toxicity tests did not cause significant 
alteration in the biochemical, hematological and histological parameters. The 
90-day sub-chronic toxicity study showed lower ALT and AST than control at doses 
1.9 mg/kg and 4.6 mg/kg, respectively. Their haematology results also showed 
higher platelet count than the controls but the differences were not 
statistically significant. Histological analysis showed increased megakaryocytes 
in the spleen for both the mice and the rats.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that short term treatment of Drs 
B2 could be safe to the animals, however, long-term treatment can have mild 
effects on the liver parameters and cause an inflammatory response in the 
spleen.

Bioactive Compounds from Endophytic Bacteria Bacillus subtilis Strain EP1 with 
Their Antibacterial Activities.

Numan M(1)(2), Shah M(1)(3), Asaf S(1), Ur Rehman N(1), Al-Harrasi A(1).

Endophytic bacteria boost host plant defense and growth by producing vital 
compounds. In the current study, a bacterial strain was isolated from the 
Boswellia sacra plant and identified as Bacillus subtilis strain EP1 (accession 
number: MT256301) through 16S RNA gene sequencing. From the identified bacteria, 
four compounds-1 (4-(4-cinnamoyloxy)phenyl)butanoic acid), 2 
(cyclo-(L-Pro-D-Tyr)), 3 (cyclo-(L-Val-L-Phe)), and 4 (cyclo-(L-Pro-L-Val))-were 
isolated and characterized by 1D and 2D NMR and mass spectroscopy. Moreover, 
antibacterial activity and beta-lactam-producing gene inhibition 
(δ-(l-α-aminoadipyl)-l-cysteinyl-d-valine synthetase (ACVS) and aminoadipate 
aminotransferase (AADAT)) assays were performed. Significant antibacterial 
activity was observed against the human pathogenic bacterial strains (E. coli) 
by compound 4 with a 13 ± 0.7 mm zone of inhibition (ZOI), followed by compound 
1 having an 11 ± 0.7 mm ZOI. In contrast, the least antibacterial activity among 
the tested samples was offered by compound 2 with a 10 ± 0.9 mm ZOI compared to 
the standard (26 ± 1.2 mm). Similarly, the molecular analysis of beta-lactam 
inhibition determined that compounds 3 and 4 inhibited the two genes (2- to 
4-fold) in the beta-lactam biosynthesis (ACVS and AADAT) pathway. From these 
results, it can be concluded that future research on these compounds could lead 
to the inhibition of antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacterial strains.

A switchable secrete-and-capture system enables efficient selection of Pichia 
pastoris clones producing high yields of Fab fragments.

Gätjen D(1), Wieczorek M(2), Listek M(3), Tomszak F(2), Nölle V(2), Hanack K(3), 
Droste M(4).

Pichia pastoris (syn. Komagataella phaffii) represents a commonly used 
expression system in the biotech industry. High clonal variation of 
transformants, however, typically results in a broad range of specific 
productivities for secreted proteins. To isolate rare clones with exceedingly 
high product titers, an extensive number of clones need to be screened. In 
contrast to high-throughput screenings of P. pastoris clones in microtiter 
plates, secrete-and-capture methodologies have the potential to efficiently 
isolate high-producer clones among millions of cells through 
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Here, we describe a novel approach 
for the non-covalent binding of fragment antigen-binding (Fab) proteins to the 
cell surface for the isolation of high-producing clones. Eight different 
single-chain variable fragment (scFv)-based capture matrices specific for the 
constant part of the Fabs were fused to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
alpha-agglutinin (SAG1) anchor protein for surface display in P. pastoris. By 
encoding the capture matrix on an episomal plasmid harboring inherently unstable 
autonomously replicating sequences (ARS), this secrete-and-capture system offers 
a switchable scFv display. Efficient plasmid clearance upon removal of selective 
pressure enabled the direct use of isolated clones for subsequent Fab 
production. Flow-sorted clones (n = 276) displaying high amounts of Fabs showed 
a significant increase in median Fab titers detected in the cell-free 
supernatant (CFS) compared to unsorted clones (n = 276) when cells were 
cultivated in microtiter plates (factor in the range of ∼21-49). Fab titers of 
clones exhibiting the highest product titer observed for each of the two 
approaches were increased by up to 8-fold for the sorted clone. Improved Fab 
yields of sorted cells vs. unsorted cells were confirmed in an upscaled shake 
flask cultivation of selected candidates (factor in the range of ∼2-3). Hence, 
the developed display-based selection method proved to be a valuable tool for 
efficient clone screening in the early stages of our bioprocess development.

The Conserved Family of the Pyridoxal Phosphate-Binding Protein (PLPBP) and Its 
Cyanobacterial Paradigm PipY.

Tremiño L(1), Llop A(1), Rubio V(2)(3), Contreras A(1).

The PLPBP family of pyridoxal phosphate-binding proteins has a high degree of 
sequence conservation and is represented in all three domains of life. PLPBP 
members, of which a few representatives have been studied in different contexts, 
are single-domain proteins with no known enzymatic activity that exhibit the 
fold type III of PLP-holoenzymes, consisting in an α/β barrel (TIM-barrel), 
where the PLP cofactor is solvent-exposed. Despite the constant presence of 
cofactor PLP (a key catalytic element in PLP enzymes), PLPBP family members 
appear to have purely regulatory functions affecting the homeostasis of vitamin 
B6 vitamers and amino/keto acids. Perturbation of these metabolites and 
pleiotropic phenotypes have been reported in bacteria and zebrafish after PLPBP 
gene inactivation as well as in patients with vitamin B6-dependent epilepsy that 
results from loss-of-function mutations at the PLPBP. Here, we review 
information gathered from diverse studies and biological systems, emphasizing 
the structural and functional conservation of the PLPBP members and discussing 
the informative nature of model systems and experimental approaches. In this 
context, the relatively high level of structural and functional characterization 
of PipY from Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 provides a unique opportunity to 
investigate the PLPBP roles in the context of a signaling pathway conserved in 
cyanobacteria.

Protective effects of Acetobacter ghanensis against gliadin toxicity in 
intestinal epithelial cells with immunoregulatory and gluten-digestive 
properties.

Doguer C(1), Akalan H(2), Tokatlı Demirok N(3), Erdal B(4), Mete R(5), Bilgen 
T(3).

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to establish whether Acetobacter ghanensis, 
the probiotic characteristics of which were evaluated previously, attenuates 
gliadin-induced toxicity in intestinal epithelial cells with gluten-digestive 
and immunoregulatory properties.
METHODS: A co-culture model of human intestinal epithelial cell (Caco-2) 
monolayers on top of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from 
patients with celiac disease (CD) was established. The gluten-digestive 
properties of A. ghanensis were determined by checking bacterial growth in a 
medium containing gluten as the main nitrogen source. The mRNA levels of genes 
encoding TJ-associated proteins were measured by quantitative real-time PCR 
(qRT-PCR). The concentrations of IL-6 and TNFα were determined by enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
RESULTS: We found that PT-gliadin disrupted intestinal barrier integrity by 
modulating the expression of TJ-associated genes encoding zonulin (increased 
by ~ 60%), zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) (decreased by ~ 22%), and occludin 
(decreased by ~ 28%) in Caco-2 cells. Furthermore, PT-gliadin treatment in 
Caco-2 cells was associated with increased concentrations of IL-6 (~ 1.6-fold) 
and TNFα (~ twofold) from PBMCs. These modulatory effects of PT-gliadin, 
however, were suppressed when Caco-2 cells were subjected to A. ghanensis in the 
presence of PT-gliadin. As a factor underlying these protective effects, we 
showed that A. ghanensis could digest gluten peptides.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, the current study is the first to demonstrate 
that A. ghanensis improves intestinal barrier functions by attenuating the 
modulatory effects of PT-gliadin with immunoregulatory and gluten-digestive 
properties.

Design and synthesis of novel benzimidazole-iminosugars linked a substituted 
phenyl group and their inhibitory activities against β-glucosidase.

Liu X(1), Li F(1), Su L(1), Wang M(2), Jia T(1), Xu X(1), Li X(1), Wei C(1), Luo 
C(3), Chen S(3), Chen H(4).

A series of novel benzimidazole-iminosugars linked a (substuituted) phenyl group 
on benzene ring of benzimidazole 5(a-p) and 6(a-p) have been rationally designed 
and conveniently synthesized through Suzuki coupling reaction in high yields. 
All compounds have been evaluated for their inhibitory activities against 
β-glucosidase (almond). Six compounds 5d, 6d, 6e, 6i, 6n, and 6p showed more 
significant inhibitory activities with IC50 values in the range of 0.03-0.08 μM, 
almost 10-fold improved than that of the parent analogue 4, and much higher than 
that of the positive control castanospermine. The additional phenyl ring and the 
electron donating groups on it would be beneficial for the activity. Compounds 
6d, 6n, and 4 had been chosen to be tested for their inhibition types against 
β-glucosidase. Interestingly, three compounds have different inhibition types 
although they had very similar structure. Their Ki values were calculated to be 
0.02 ± 0.01 μM, 0.02 ± 0.01 μM, and 0.66 ± 0.14 μM, respectively. The 
equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) for 6d, 6n, and 4 and β-glucosidase was 
0.04 μM, 0.03 μM and 0.45 μM by the ITC-based assay, respectively. Molecular 
docking work suggests that such benzimidazole-iminosugars derivatives might bind 
to the active site of β-glucosidase mainly through hydrogen bonds, the 
additional phenyl ring towards the solvent-exposed region played an important 
effect on their inhibitory activity against β-glucosidase.

Ultrasensitive multiplexed chemiluminescent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays 
in 384-well plates.

Chen T(1), Ubaidu A(1), Douglas S(1), Carranza S(1), Wong A(1), Kan CW(1), Duffy 
DC(2).

We have developed an ultrasensitive multiplexed immunoassay using 384-well 
microtiter plates capable of detecting proteins at subfemtomolar concentrations 
that requires as little as 2.5 μL of sample. Arrays of up to 4 capture 
antibodies were patterned on the bottom of the wells of a 384-well plate either 
by directly printing the capture antibodies or by printing anti-peptide tag 
anchor antibodies and incubating these arrays with capture antibodies conjugated 
to the corresponding peptide tags ("customized" assays). Samples were incubated 
with the antibody arrays and shaken orbitally at 2000 rpm to achieve the 
greatest sensitivity. Chemiluminescence (CL) from immunocomplexes labeled with 
horseradish peroxidase was imaged across the entire plate to quantify the amount 
of protein bound to each antibody spot of the arrays. The 384-well assay had a 
throughput 5-fold greater than 96-well plates that was achieved from 
simultaneous imaging of CL in all 384-wells and the use of automated pipettors 
to allow parallel processing of 384 assays. We developed 4 assays based on the 
384-well CL ELISA: a direct print assay for IL-10 (limit of detection 
(LOD) = 0.075 fM); a customized assay for IL-6 (0.22 fM); a customized 
pharmacokinetic (PK) assay for measuring adalimumab (7.3 pg/mL); and a 
customized 4-plex assay for IL-5 (0.1 fM), IL-6 (0.52 fM), IL-10 (0.2 fM), and 
TNF-α (3.2 fM). The sensitivity and precision of the cytokine assays were 
comparable to current ultrasensitive protein detection methods in 96-well 
formats. The PK assay for adalimumab was 650 times more sensitive than a 
commercially available 96-well plate ELISA. We used the 384-well CL ELISAs to 
measure endogenous levels of the cytokines in the serum and plasma of healthy 
humans: the mean concentrations and precision were comparable to those from 
96-well immunoassays. This 384-well format with subfemtomolar sensitivity will 
enable ultrasensitive multiplexed immunoassays to be performed with higher 
throughput and lower sample volumes than currently possible, a particularly 
important capability for clinical studies in drug development.

Enhanced antioxidant capacity of lipoic acid in different food systems through 
lipase-mediated esterification with phytosterols.

He WS(1), Sun Y(1), Li Z(1), Yang H(1), Li J(1), Wang Q(1), Tan C(2), Zou B(1).

BACKGROUND: α-Lipoic acid has excellent antioxidant activity, but its poor lipid 
solubility greatly limits its practical application. This study was undertaken 
(i) to develop a novel and efficient enzymatic synthesis of lipophilic lipoic 
acid esters using Candida sp. 99-125 lipase as a catalyst; and (ii) to 
systematically evaluate their antioxidant potential against bulk oil, 
oil-in-water emulsion (O/W) and cooked ground meat.
RESULTS: Lipophilic lipoic acid esters were successfully and efficiently 
synthesized using phytosterols as acyl receptor in the presence of Candida sp. 
99-125 lipase. The product was identified as phytosterol lipoate by mass 
spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic 
resonance. The maximum conversion of phytosterol lipoate surpassed 90% within 
12 h and its final yield exceeded 81%. Interestingly, the oil solubility of 
lipoic acid was increased at least 25-fold and other physicochemical properties 
were significantly improved. Most importantly, phytosterol lipoate exhibited 
higher antioxidant activity than lipoic acid in bulk oil, O/W emulsions and 
cooked ground meat.
CONCLUSION: The antioxidant capacity of lipoic acid can be significantly 
enhanced by esterification with phytosterols. Therefore, phytosterol lipoate 
could be further developed as a new antioxidant for use in oil- and fat-based 
foods. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.

Suppressors of amyloid-β toxicity improve recombinant protein production in 
yeast by reducing oxidative stress and tuning cellular metabolism.

Chen X(1), Li X(2), Ji B(3), Wang Y(2), Ishchuk OP(2), Vorontsov E(4), 
Petranovic D(5), Siewers V(5), Engqvist MKM(2).

High-level production of recombinant proteins in industrial microorganisms is 
often limited by the formation of misfolded proteins or protein aggregates, 
which consequently induce cellular stress responses. We hypothesized that in a 
yeast Alzheimer's disease (AD) model overexpression of amyloid-β peptides 
(Aβ42), one of the main peptides relevant for AD pathologies, induces similar 
phenotypes of cellular stress. Using this humanized AD model, we previously 
identified suppressors of Aβ42 cytotoxicity. Here we hypothesize that these 
suppressors could be used as metabolic engineering targets to alleviate cellular 
stress and improve recombinant protein production in the yeast Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae. Forty-six candidate genes were individually deleted and twenty were 
individually overexpressed. The positive targets that increased recombinant 
α-amylase production were further combined leading to an 18.7-fold increased 
recombinant protein production. These target genes are involved in multiple 
cellular networks including RNA processing, transcription, ER-mitochondrial 
complex, and protein unfolding. By using transcriptomics and proteomics 
analyses, combined with reverse metabolic engineering, we showed that reduced 
oxidative stress, increased membrane lipid biosynthesis and repressed arginine 
and sulfur amino acid biosynthesis are significant pathways for increased 
recombinant protein production. Our findings provide new insights towards 
developing synthetic yeast cell factories for biosynthesis of valuable proteins.

Long-term incidence in hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic bile duct 
cancer in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, role of Thorotrast?

Hemminki K(1)(2), Tichanek F(1)(3), Försti A(4)(5), Hemminki O(6)(7), Liska 
V(1)(8), Hemminki A(6)(9).

We analyzed long-term incidence trends in liver cancer (including hepatocellular 
carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma) with an aim to interpret the 
changes in terms of known risk factors and hypothesize that historical exposure 
to Thorotrast, a radiographic contrast medium emitting alpha particles, has 
changed population rates. The NORDCAN database was used to collect cancer 
registry data from Denmark (DK), Finland (FI), Norway (NO) and Sweden (SE), 
which we used from 1953 (DK, FI and NO) and 1960 (SE) through 2019. Thorotrast, 
which caused a 100-fold risk of liver cancer was used in DK and SE, and probably 
also in FI between 1930 and 1950, but not in NO. The incidence trend for liver 
cancer showed a broad maximum at around 1980, most prominent and statistically 
significant in SE and DK men and women, and in all countries, a steadily 
increasing trend towards the end of follow-up. Incidence for NO was lower than 
for the other countries and the rates showed no peaking at around 1980. Birth 
cohort analysis identified a transient risk which could be dated to a period 
between 1930 and 1950 in countries other than NO. Considering a lag time between 
Thorotrast use and liver cancer appearance, the large incidence peak around 1980 
in DK and DE was probably contributed by Thorotrast but considering the 
ecological nature of the findings, the association should be considered 
cautiously as hypothesis generating. The late increase in liver cancer risk is 
most likely lifestyle related and largely preventable.

LYSET/TMEM251- a novel key component of the mannose 6-phosphate pathway.

Qiao W(1), Richards CM(1), Jabs S(2).

Degradation of macromolecules delivered to lysosomes by processes such as 
autophagy or endocytosis is crucial for cellular function. Lysosomes require 
more than 60 soluble hydrolases in order to catabolize such macromolecules. 
These soluble hydrolases are tagged with mannose6-phosphate (M6P) moieties in 
sequential reactions by the Golgi-resident GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase complex 
and NAGPA/UCE/uncovering enzyme (N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphodiester 
alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase), which allows their delivery to 
endosomal/lysosomal compartments through trafficking mediated by 
cation-dependent and -independent mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs). We and 
others recently identified TMEM251 as a novel regulator of the M6P pathway via 
independent genome-wide genetic screening strategies. We renamed TMEM251 to 
LYSET (lysosomal enzyme trafficking factor) to establish nomenclature reflective 
to this gene's function. LYSET is a Golgi-localized transmembrane protein 
important for the retention of the GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase complex in the 
Golgi-apparatus. The current understanding of LYSET's importance regarding human 
biology is 3-fold: 1) highly pathogenic viruses that depend on lysosomal 
hydrolase activity require LYSET for infection. 2) The presence of LYSET is 
critical for cancer cell proliferation in nutrient-deprived environments in 
which extracellular proteins must be catabolized. 3) Inherited pathogenic 
alleles of LYSET can cause a severe inherited disease which resembles 
GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase deficiency (i.e., mucolipidosis type 
II).Abbreviations: GlcNAc-1-PT: GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase; KO: knockout; LSD: 
lysosomal storage disorder; LYSET: lysosomal enzyme trafficking factor; M6P: 
mannose 6-phosphate; MPRs: mannose-6-phosphate receptors, cation-dependent or 
-independent; MBTPS1/site-1 protease: membrane bound transcription factor 
peptidase, site 1; MLII: mucolipidosis type II; WT: wild-type.

Oral Microbiota Alteration and Roles in Epstein-Barr Virus Reactivation in 
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.

J(5), Jia WH(1)(3).

Microbiota has recently emerged as a critical factor associated with multiple 
malignancies. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is highly associated with 
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV); the oncovirus resides and is transmitted in the oral 
cavity. However, the alternation of oral microbiota in NPC patients and its 
potential link to EBV reactivation and host cell response under the simultaneous 
existence of EBV and specific bacteria is largely unknown. Here, oral microbiota 
profiles of 303 NPC patients and controls with detailed clinical information, 
including serum EBV anti-virus capsid antigen (VCA) IgA level, were conducted. A 
distinct microbial community with lower diversity and imbalanced composition in 
NPC patients was observed. Notably, among enriched bacteria in patients, 
Streptococcus sanguinis was associated with anti-VCA IgA, an indicator of NPC 
risk and EBV reactivation. By measuring the concentration of its metabolite, 
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), in the saliva of clinical patients, we found the 
detection rate of H2O2 was 2-fold increased compared to healthy controls. 
Further coculture assay of EBV-positive Akata cells with bacteria in vitro 
showed that S. sanguinis induced EBV lytic activation by its metabolite, H2O2. 
Host and EBV whole genome-wide transcriptome sequencing and EBV methylation 
assays showed that H2O2 triggered the host cell signaling pathways, notably 
tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) via NF-κB, and induced the demethylation of 
the global EBV genome and the expression of EBV lytic-associated genes, which 
could result in an increase of virus particle release and potential favorable 
events toward tumorigenesis. In brief, our study identified a characterized oral 
microbial profile in NPC patients and established a robust link between specific 
oral microbial alteration and switch of latency to lytic EBV infection status in 
the oral cavity, which provides novel insights into EBV's productive cycle and 
might help to further clarify the etiology of NPC. IMPORTANCE EBV is classified 
as the group I human carcinogen and is associated with multiple cancers, 
including NPC. The interplays between the microbiota and oncovirus in cancer 
development remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigate the 
interactions between resident microbes and EBV coexistence in the oral cavity of 
NPC patients. We identify a distinct oral microbial feature for NPC patients. 
Among NPC-enriched bacteria, we illustrated that a specific species, S. 
sanguinis, associated with elevated anti-IgA VCA in patients, induced EBV lytic 
activation by its by-product, H2O2, and activated the TNF-α/NF-κB pathway of 
EBV-positive B cells in vitro, together with increased detection rate of H2O2 in 
patients' oral cavities, which strengthened the evidence of bacteria-virus-host 
interaction in physiological circumstances. The effects of imbalanced microbiota 
on the EBV latent-to-lytic switch in the oral cavity might create the likelihood 
of EBV infection in epithelial cells at the nasopharynx and help malignant 
transition and cancer development.

Multi-class classification model for psychiatric disorder discrimination.

Emre İE(1), Erol Ç(2), Taş C(3), Tarhan N(4).

BACKGROUND: Physicians follow-up a symptom-based approach in the diagnosis of 
psychiatric diseases. According to this approach, a process based on 
internationally valid diagnostic tools such as The Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) or International Classification of Diseases 
(ICD), patient reports and the observation and experience of the physician is 
monitored. As in other fields of medicine, the search for biomarkers that can be 
used in processes related to diseases continues in psychiatry and various 
researches are carried out in this field.
OBJECTIVES: Within the scope of this study, a dataset containing 
electroencephalogram (EEG) measurements of individuals diagnosed with different 
psychiatric diseases were analyzed by machine learning methods and the diseases 
were differentiated/classified with the models obtained. Thus, it was 
investigated whether EEG data could be a biomarker for psychiatric diseases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the dataset analyzed within the scope of the study, 
for 550 patients (81 bipolar disorder, 95 attention deficit and hyperactivity 
disorder - ADHD, 67 depression, 34 obsessive compulsive disorder - OCD, 75 
opioid, 146 posttraumatic stress disorder - PTSD, 52 schizophrenia) and 84 
healthy individuals, there are 634 samples (rows), 77 variables (columns) in 
total. 76 of the variables consist of absolute power values belonging to 4 
frequency bands (alpha, beta, delta, theta) collected from 19 different 
electrodes. 80 % of the dataset was used for training the models and 20 % of the 
data was used for testing the performance of the models. The 5-fold cross 
validation (CV) method, which repeats 3 times in the training dataset, was used 
and with this method, the hyperparameters used in the models were also 
optimized. Different models have been established with the selected 
hyperparameters and the performance of these models has been tested with the 
test dataset. C5.0, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and 
artificial neural networks (ANN) were used to build the models.
RESULTS: Within the scope of the study, the absolute power values obtained from 
EEG measurements performed using 19 electrodes were analyzed by machine learning 
methods. It was concluded that classification between disease groups was 
feasible with a high accuracy (C5.0-0.841, SVM_radial - 0.841, RF - 0.762). It 
was observed that ADHD, depression and schizophrenia diseases can be 
differentiated better (F-score = 1, balanced accuracy = 1) once the results were 
evaluated on a class category basis according to the F- measure and balanced 
accuracy values.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Through the medium of the analyzes made within the 
scope of this study, it was investigated whether EEG data could be used as a 
biomarker for the detection and diagnosis of psychiatric diseases. The findings 
obtained from this study revealed that by using EEG data as a biomarker, it can 
be highly predicted whether a person has a psychiatric disease or not. Once 
evaluated with broad strokes, it is feasible to assert that it is possible to 
analyze whether the person who consults a physician with a complaint is ranked 
among the psychiatric disease class with EEG measurement. When trying to 
differentiate between numerous and diverse disease categories, it may be claimed 
that some diseases (ADHD, depression, schizophrenia) can be distinguished better 
by coming to the fore on a model basis. Considering the findings, it is 
anticipated that the analyzes obtained as a result of this study will contribute 
to the studies to be conducted using machine learning in the field of 
psychiatry.

HLA-B*27 Heavy Chain Homo-Oligomers Promote the Cytotoxicity of NK Cells via 
Activation of PI3K/AKT Signaling.

Yu HC(1), Huang KY(2)(3), Lu MC(1)(2)(3), Huang Tseng HY(2), Liu SQ(2), Lai 
NS(2)(3), Huang HB(4).

Background and Objectives: Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory 
disease and is highly linked with the expression of the human leukocytic 
antigen-B*27 (HLA-B*27) genotype. HLA-B*27 heavy chain (B*27-HC) has an innate 
characteristic to slowly fold, resulting in the accumulation of the misfolded 
B*27-HC and the formation of homo-oligomeric B*27-HC molecules. The 
homo-oligomeric B*27-HC can act as a ligand of KIR3DL2. Interaction of the 
homo-oligomeric B*27-HC molecules with KIR3DL2 will trigger the survival and 
activation of KIR3DL2-positive NK cells. However, the effects of homo-oligomeric 
B*27-HC molecules associated with KIR3DL2 on the cytotoxic activity of NK cells 
and their cytokine expressions remain unknown. Materials and Methods: 
HLA-B*-2704-HC was overexpressed in the HMy2.C1R (C1R) cell line. Western 
blotting and quantitative RT-PCR were used to analyze the protein expression and 
cytokine expression, respectively, when C1R-B*-2704 cells that overexpress 
B*2704-HC were co-cultured with NK-92MI cells. Flow cytometry was used to 
analyze the cytotoxicity mediated by NK-92MI cells. Results: Our results 
revealed that NK-92MI cells up-regulated the expression of perforin and enhanced 
the cytotoxic activity via augmentation of PI3K/AKT signaling after co-culturing 
with C1R-B*2704 cells. Suppression of the dimerized B*27-HC formation or 
treatment with an inhibitor of PI3K, LY294002, or with an anti-B*27-HC 
monoclonal antibody can reduce the perforin expression of NK-92MI after 
co-culturing with C1R-B*-2704. Co-culturing with C1R-B*-2704 cells suppressed 
the TNF-α and IL6 expressions of NK-92MI cells. Conclusion: Stimulation of NK 
cell-mediated cytotoxicity by homo-oligomeric B*27-HC molecules may contribute 
to the pathogenesis of AS.

Keratin 8 is a scaffolding and regulatory protein of ERAD complexes.

Early recognition and enhanced degradation of misfolded proteins by the 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control and ER-associated degradation (ERAD) 
cause defective protein secretion and membrane targeting, as exemplified for 
Z-alpha-1-antitrypsin (Z-A1AT), responsible for alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency 
(A1ATD) and F508del-CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) 
responsible for cystic fibrosis (CF). Prompted by our previous observation that 
decreasing Keratin 8 (K8) expression increased trafficking of F508del-CFTR to 
the plasma membrane, we investigated whether K8 impacts trafficking of soluble 
misfolded Z-A1AT protein. The subsequent goal of this study was to elucidate the 
mechanism underlying the K8-dependent regulation of protein trafficking, 
focusing on the ERAD pathway. The results show that diminishing K8 concentration 
in HeLa cells enhances secretion of both Z-A1AT and wild-type (WT) A1AT with a 
13-fold and fourfold increase, respectively. K8 down-regulation triggers ER 
failure and cellular apoptosis when ER stress is jointly elicited by conditional 
expression of the µs heavy chains, as previously shown for Hrd1 knock-out. 
Simultaneous K8 silencing and Hrd1 knock-out did not show any synergistic 
effect, consistent with K8 acting in the Hrd1-governed ERAD step. Fractionation 
and co-immunoprecipitation experiments reveal that K8 is recruited to ERAD 
complexes containing Derlin2, Sel1 and Hrd1 proteins upon expression of 
Z/WT-A1AT and F508del-CFTR. Treatment of the cells with c407, a small molecule 
inhibiting K8 interaction, decreases K8 and Derlin2 recruitment to high-order 
ERAD complexes. This was associated with increased Z-A1AT secretion in both HeLa 
and Z-homozygous A1ATD patients' respiratory cells. Overall, we provide evidence 
that K8 acts as an ERAD modulator. It may play a scaffolding protein role for 
early-stage ERAD complexes, regulating Hrd1-governed retrotranslocation 
initiation/ubiquitination processes. Targeting K8-containing ERAD complexes is 
an attractive strategy for the pharmacotherapy of A1ATD.

First Report of Pectobacterium versatile Causing Stem Rot of Tobacco in China.

Lu CH(1), Zhen AZ(2), Jiang N(3), Fan YY(4), Du F(5), Gai X(6), Lin ZL(7), Ma 
JH(8), Jin Y(9)(10), Xia ZY(11).

Tobacco is one of the most significant non-food cash crops (Lu et al. 2020). In 
March 2022, cigar tobacco plants showing characteristic symptoms of vascular 
discoloration, stem rotting, leaf wilting and rotting were observed in Tengchong 
city (N 25°3'26″, E 98°25'6″) of Yunnan province, China (Fig. S1). The disease 
incidence was about 5% on cultivar Yunxue 6 in a 33-ha field. Infected stems 
were collected from Tengchong for pathogen isolation and 16S rDNA sequence 
analysis was performed as previously described (Lu et al. 2021). Sequence 
analysis showed that tobacco isolates (GenBank accession numbers: ON795108, 
ON795107 and ON795106) had an identical sequence with that of the species type 
strain of Pectobacterium versatile CFBP 6051T and shared the sequence identities 
of 99.55% and 99.47% with P. carotovorum DSM 30168T and P. parvum s0421T, 
respectively. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis showed that tobacco strains 
were clustered with Pectobacterium versatile CFBP 6051T (Fig. S2a). In API 
assays, strain 22TC1 was positive for β-galactosidase activity, reduction of 
nitrates to nitrites, fermentation of glucose, hydrolysis of esculin and 
gelatin, assimilation of D-glucose, L-arabinose, D-mannose, D-mannitol, 
N-acetylglucosamine, malic acid and trisodium citrate; positive for the 
enzymatic substrates of alkaline phosphatase, leucine arylamidase, acid 
phosphatase, naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase, α-galactosidase, β-galactosidase 
and α-glucosidase. Furthermore, the average nucleotide identity (ANI) analysis 
(Richter et al. 2015) showed that strain 22TC1 (GenBank accession number: 
JAMWYQ000000000) had the highest ANIb score of 96.76% and ANIm value of 97.19% 
with P. versatile CFBP 6051T. Similarly, in silico DNA-DNA hybridization (isDDH) 
value was 74.5% compared to P. versatile CFBP 6051T, isDDH values were 
35.5-63.7% with the other Pectobacterium species, which below the 70% threshold 
value for species delineation (Meier-Kolthoff et al. 2021). The phylogenomic 
analysis also showed that strain 22TC1 was clustered with the species type 
strain of P. versatile CFBP 6051T. For pathogenicity tests, cell suspension with 
ten-fold dilution (approx. 1 x 108 CFU/ml) was injected into the leaf axils of 
two 2-month-old tobacco stems (cv. Yunyan 87). As a control, tobacco seedlings 
were inoculated with sterile distilled water. The plants were sealed in plastic 
bags and maintained in a growth chamber at 28°C for 2 d. The symptoms of 
water-soaked decay were observed within 24 h of inoculation. Whole-plant decay 
was at 2 days after injection. No symptoms were developed in the controls. 
Reisolation was performed on diseased stems and the identity of isolated 
bacteria was confirmed by PCR and sequencing of 16S rRNA. Similar results were 
obtained in two independent experiments. Based on the above-described data, the 
causal pathogen of stem rot on cigar tobacco in Tengchong was identified as P. 
versatile. To our knowledge, this is the first time that P. versatile is found 
to cause stem rot on tobacco. Pectobacterium species have been reported to cause 
seed-borne diseases on tobacco seedlings in the floating tray system and 
soil-borne diseases in tobacco fields (Wang et al. 2017; Xia and Mo 2007). 
Therefore, studying the possible transmission of the P. versatile to tobacco 
plants is necessary.

Fragment Crystallizable Fusion Proteins at Pharmacologically Active Doses.

Fragment crystallizable (Fc) fusion is commonly used for extending the half-life 
of biotherapeutics such as cytokines. In this work, we studied the 
pharmacokinetics of Fc-fused interleukin-10 (IL-10) proteins that exhibited 
potent antitumor activity in mouse syngeneic tumor models. At pharmacologically 
active doses of ≥0.1 mg/kg, both mouse Fc-mouse IL-10 and human Fc-human IL-10, 
constructed as the C terminus of the Fc domain fused with IL-10 via a 
glycine-serine polypeptide linker, exhibited nonlinear pharmacokinetics after 
intravenous administration to mice at the doses of 0.05, 0.5, and 5 mg/kg. With 
a nominal dose ratio of 1:10:100; the ratio of the area under the curve for 
mouse Fc-mouse IL-10 and human Fc-human IL-10 was 1:181:1830 and 1:75:633, 
respectively. In contrast, recombinant mouse or human IL-10 proteins exhibited 
linear pharmacokinetics in mice. Compartmental analysis, using the 
Michaelis-Menten equation with the in vitro IL-10 receptor alpha binding 
affinity inputted as the Km, unified the pharmacokinetic data across the dose 
range. Additionally, nontarget-mediated clearance estimated for fusion proteins 
was ∼200-fold slower than that for cytokines, causing the manifestation of 
target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) in the fusion protein pharmacokinetics. 
The experimental data generated with a mouse IL-10 receptor alpha-blocking 
antibody and a human Fc-human IL-10 mutant with a reduced receptor binding 
affinity showed significant improvements in pharmacokinetics, supporting TMDD as 
the cause of nonlinearity. Target expression and its effect on pharmacokinetics 
must be determined when considering using Fc as a half-life extension strategy, 
and pharmacokinetic evaluations need to be performed at a range of doses 
covering pharmacological activity. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Target-mediated drug 
disposition can manifest to affect the pharmacokinetics of a fragment 
crystallizable (Fc)-fused cytokine when the nontarget-mediated clearance of the 
cytokine is decreased due to neonatal Fc receptor-mediated recycling and 
molecular weight increases that reduce the renal clearance. The phenomenon was 
demonstrated with interleukin-10 Fc-fusion proteins in mice at pharmacologically 
active doses. Future drug designs using Fc as a half-life extension approach for 
cytokines need to consider target expression and its effect on pharmacokinetics 
at relevant doses.

Exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in a 
multiethnic cohort.

Goodrich JA(1), Walker D(2), Lin X(2), Wang H(1), Lim T(1), McConnell R(1), 
Conti DV(1)(3), Chatzi L(1), Setiawan VW(1)(3).

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Exposure to poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a 
class of persistent organic pollutants, is ubiquitous. Animal studies suggest 
that PFAS may increase risk of fatty liver and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
via impacts on hepatic lipid, amino acid, and glucose metabolism, but human data 
is lacking. We examined associations between PFAS exposure, altered metabolic 
pathways, and risk of non-viral HCC.
METHODS: In this nested case-control study, pre-diagnostic plasma PFAS and 
metabolomics were measured in 50 incident HCC cases and 50 individually matched 
controls from the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) study. Cases/controls were matched by 
age, sex, race, and study area. PFAS exposure and risk of HCC were examined 
using conditional logistic regression. A metabolome-wide association study and 
pathway enrichment analysis was performed for PFAS exposure and HCC risk, and 
key metabolites/metabolic pathways were identified using a meet in the middle 
approach.
RESULTS: High perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) levels (90th percentile from 
NHANES; >55 μg/L) were associated with 4.5-fold increased risk of HCC (odds 
ratio 4.5, 95% CI 1.2-16.0). Pathway enrichment analysis showed that PFOS 
exposure was associated with alterations in amino acid and glycan biosynthesis 
pathways, which were also associated with HCC risk. We identified 4 metabolites 
linking PFOS exposure with HCC, including glucose, butyric acid (a short-chain 
fatty acid), α-ketoisovaleric acid (a branched-chain α-keto acid), and 
7α-hydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholestenoate (a bile acid), each of which was positively 
associated with PFOS exposure and risk of HCC.
CONCLUSION: This proof-of-concept analysis shows that exposure to high PFOS 
levels was associated with increased risk of non-viral HCC, likely via 
alterations in glucose, amino acid, and bile acid metabolism. Larger studies are 
needed to confirm these findings.
LAY SUMMARY: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), often referred to as 
"forever chemicals" because they are difficult to break down and stay in the 
human body for years, are extremely common and can cause liver damage. In a 
first of its kind study, we found that exposure to high levels of 
perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, one of the most common PFAS chemicals, was linked 
to increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in humans. Hepatocellular 
carcinoma is difficult to treat and is one of the most common forms of liver 
cancer, and these findings may provide new avenues for helping to prevent this 
disease.

Surface facet Fe(2)O(3)-based visible light photocatalytic activation of 
persulfate for the removal of RR120 dye: nonlinear modeling and optimization.

Photocatalytic activation of persulfate (PS) is recently emerged as an 
energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable approach for pollutants 
degradation, which enables to leverage the strengths of low-cost solar energy 
and heterogeneous catalysis. Herein, we investigated the photocatalytic 
decomposition of reactive red 120 (RR120) dye using PS-activated Fe2O3 
nanoparticles and elucidated the effect of their facets, α-Fe2O3 (001), β-Fe2O3 
(100), and γ-Fe2O3 (111). β-Fe2O3 not only boosted the charge carrier separation 
but also provided more active sites for PS activation resulting in 6- and 
3.5-fold higher photocatalytic activities compared to α-Fe2O3 and γ-Fe2O3, 
respectively. Response surface methodology and artificial neural network coupled 
with genetic algorithm models were utilized to optimize and foresee Fe2O3/PS 
system under visible light. Almost 100% color removal and 82% organic removal 
were observed under the optimum conditions at 20 mg/L RR120, 22 mg/L β-Fe2O3, 
18 mg/L PS, and pH: 3. Scavenger test indicated that both sulfate and hydroxyl 
radicals are responsible for the observed RR120 removal. Although cell viability 
test indicated that cytotoxicity of wastewater is not significantly reduced 
after treatment. All the results proposed that β-Fe2O3/PS at relatively low 
doses has a great potential to decompose and mineralize recalcitrant dyes in 
wastewater under invisible light.

Heat stress causes infertility in male rabbits in summer. This study was 
conducted to determine the effects of heat stress on semen quality and seminal 
plasma metabolites of male rabbits. To achieve these objectives, the temperature 
and humidity index (THI) was used to determine the stress state of male rabbits 
during different months, thereby the rabbits were divided into heat stress and 
no heat stress groups. The quality of the semen and the biochemical indices of 
seminal plasma were then analyzed. Next the plasma metabolites of rabbits in 
both groups were evaluated using the ultra-high performance liquid 
chromatography-mass spectroscopy (UPLC-MS)/MS technique. Our results showed that 
the THI value of the rabbit housing in May was 20.94 (no heat stress). The THI 
value of the housing in August was 29.10 (heat stress group, n = 10). Compared 
with the non-heat stress group, the sperm motility, density, and pH in the heat 
stress group (n = 10) were significantly decreased (P < 0.01); the semen volume 
decreased significantly (P < 0.05); and the sperm malformation rate increased 
significantly (P < 0.01). The number of grade A sperm significantly decreased, 
while the numbers of B and C grade sperm significantly increased (P < 0.01). The 
total sperm output (TSO), total motile sperm (TMS), and total functional sperm 
fraction (TFSF) decreased significantly (P < 0.01). Heat stress protein 70 
(HSP70) and acid phosphatase (ACP) in the seminal plasma of rabbits in the heat 
stress group (n = 20) were significantly increased (P < 0.01). Seminal plasma 
testosterone (T), α-glucosidase (α-Glu), and fructose decreased significantly (P 
< 0.01). The concentrations of Mg2+ (P < 0.05), Na+ (P < 0.01), and K+ (P < 
0.01) in metal ions were significantly decreased. These findings indicated that 
heat stress severely affected the quality of the male rabbit semen. Furthermore, 
UPLC-MS/MS technology was used to analyze the seminal plasma samples of rabbits 
in the heat stress group and non-heat stress group (n = 9 for each group). In 
total, 346 metabolites were identified, with variable importance in project 
(VIP) > 1.0, fold change (FC) > 1.5 or < 0.667, and P < 0.05 as the threshold. A 
total of 71 differential metabolites were matched, including stearic acid, 
betaine, arachidonic acid, L-malic acid, and indole. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of 
Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis of differential metabolites 
revealed 51 metabolic pathways, including synthesis and degradation of ketones, 
serine and threonine metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, and the citric acid 
cycle. Our study has shown that the sperm motility, sperm pH value, and sperm 
density of male rabbits decreased significantly under heat stress, and the sperm 
malformation rate increased significantly. Furthermore, the quality of semen was 
shown to deteriorate and the energy metabolism pathway was disturbed. These 
findings provide a theoretical reference for alleviating the adaptive heat 
stress in male rabbits.

Development of Novel 1,3-Disubstituted-2-Thiohydantoin Analogues with Potent 
Anti-Inflammatory Activity; In Vitro and In Silico Assessments.

Inflammation is the main cause of several autoimmune diseases, including type I 
diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, bullous pemphigoid, paraneoplastic pemphigoid, 
and multiple sclerosis. Currently, there is an urgent demand for the discovery 
of novel anti-inflammatory drugs with potent activity but also safe for 
long-term application. Toward this aim, the present study reported the design, 
synthesis, and characterization of a set of novel 
1,3-disubstituted-2-thiohydantoins derivatives. The anti-inflammatory activity 
of synthesized compounds was assessed against murine leukemia cell line 
(RAW264.7) by evaluating the cytotoxicity activity and their potency to prevent 
nitric oxide (NO) production. The results revealed that the synthesized 
compounds possess a considerable cytotoxic activity together with the ability to 
reduce the NO production in murine leukemia cell line (RAW264.7). Among 
synthesized compounds, compound 7 exhibited the most potent cytotoxic activity 
with IC50 of 197.68 μg/mL, compared to celecoxib drug (IC50 value 251.2 μg/mL), 
and demonstrated a significant ability to diminish the NO production (six-fold 
reduction). Exploring the mode of action responsible for the anti-inflammatory 
activity revealed that compound 7 displays a significant and dose-dependent 
inhibitory effect on the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β. 
Furthermore, compound 7 demonstrated the ability to significantly reduce the 
expression of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α at 50 μg/mL, as compared 
to Celecoxib. Finally, detailed molecular modelling studies indicated that 
compound 7 exhibits a substantial binding affinity toward the binding pocket of 
the cyclooxygenase 2 enzyme. Taken together, our study reveals that 
1,3-disubstituted-2-thiohydantoin could be considered as a promising scaffold 
for the development of potent anti-inflammatory agents.

BACKGROUND: Metabolic disorder increases the risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm 
(AAA). NRs (nuclear receptors) have been increasingly recognized as important 
regulators of cell metabolism. However, the role of NRs in AAA development 
remains largely unknown.
METHODS: We analyzed the expression profile of the NR superfamily in AAA tissues 
and identified NR1D1 (NR subfamily 1 group D member 1) as the most highly 
upregulated NR in AAA tissues. To examine the role of NR1D1 in AAA formation, we 
used vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC)-specific, endothelial cell-specific, and 
myeloid cell-specific conditional Nr1d1 knockout mice in both AngII (angiotensin 
II)- and CaPO4-induced AAA models.
RESULTS: Nr1d1 gene expression exhibited the highest fold change among all 49 
NRs in AAA tissues, and NR1D1 protein was upregulated in both human and murine 
VSMCs from AAA tissues. The knockout of Nr1d1 in VSMCs but not endothelial cells 
and myeloid cells inhibited AAA formation in both AngII- and CaPO4-induced AAA 
models. Mechanistic studies identified ACO2 (aconitase-2), a key enzyme of the 
mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle, as a direct target trans-repressed by 
NR1D1 that mediated the regulatory effects of NR1D1 on mitochondrial metabolism. 
NR1D1 deficiency restored the ACO2 dysregulation and mitochondrial dysfunction 
at the early stage of AngII infusion before AAA formation. Supplementation with 
αKG (α-ketoglutarate, a downstream metabolite of ACO2) was beneficial in 
preventing and treating AAA in mice in a manner that required NR1D1 in VSMCs.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data define a previously unrecognized role of nuclear receptor 
NR1D1 in AAA pathogenesis and an undescribed NR1D1-ACO2 axis involved in 
regulating mitochondrial metabolism in VSMCs. It is important that our findings 
suggest αKG supplementation as an effective therapeutic approach for AAA 
treatment.

INTRODUCTION: In the randomized double-blind placebo-controlled CounterCOVID 
study, oral imatinib treatment conferred a positive clinical outcome and a 
signal for reduced mortality in COVID-19 patients. High concentrations of 
alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AAG) were observed in these patients and were 
associated with increased total imatinib concentrations.
AIMS: This post-hoc study aimed to compare the difference in exposure following 
oral imatinib administration in COVID-19 patients to cancer patients and assess 
assocations between pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and pharmacodynamic (PD) 
outcomes of imatinib in COVID-19 patients. We hypothesize that a relatively 
higher drug exposure of imatinib in severe COVID-19 patients leads to improved 
pharmacodynamic outcome parameters.
METHODS: 648 total concentration plasma samples obtained from 168 COVID-19 
patients were compared to 475 samples of 105 cancer patients, using an 
AAG-binding model. Total trough concentration at steady state (Cttrough) and 
total average area under the concentration-time curve (AUCtave) were associated 
with ratio between partial oxygen pressure and fraction of inspired oxygen 
(P/F), WHO ordinal scale (WHO-score) and liberation of oxygen supplementation 
(O2lib). Linear regression, linear mixed effects models and time-to-event 
analysis were adjusted for possible confounders.
RESULTS: AUCtave and Cttrough were respectively 2.21-fold (95%CI 2.07-2.37) and 
1.53-fold (95%CI 1.44-1.63) lower for cancer compared to COVID-19 patients. 
Cttrough, not AUCtave, associated significantly with P/F (β=-19,64; 
p-value=0.014) and O2lib (HR 0.78; p-value= 0.032), after adjusting for sex, 
age, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, dexamethasone concomitant treatment, AAG and 
baseline P/F-and WHO-score. Cttrough, but not AUCtave associated significantly 
with WHO-score. These results suggest an inverse relationship between 
PK-parameters, Cttrough and AUCtave, and PD outcomes.
CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients exhibit higher total imatinib exposure compared to 
cancer patients, attributed to differences in plasma protein concentrations. 
Higher imatinib exposure in COVID-19 patients did not associate with improved 
clinical outcomes. Cttrough and AUCtave inversely associated with some 
PD-outcomes, which may be biased by disease course, variability in metabolic 
rate and protein binding. Therefore, additional PKPD analyses into unbound 
imatinib and its main metabolite may better explain exposure-response.

Acute Hepatitis A in Ifnar1(-/-) Mice.

Although hepatitis A virus (HAV) is associated only with acute hepatitis in 
humans, HAV RNA persists within the liver for months following resolution of 
liver inflammation and cessation of fecal virus shedding in chimpanzees and 
murine models of hepatitis A. Here, we confirm striking differences in the 
kinetics of HAV RNA clearance from liver versus serum and feces in infected 
Ifnar1-/- mice and investigate the nature of viral RNA persisting in the liver 
following normalization of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. Fecal 
shedding of virus produced in hepatocytes declined >3,000-fold between its peak 
at day 14 and day 126, whereas intrahepatic HAV RNA declined only 32-fold by day 
154. Viral RNA was identified within hepatocytes 3 to 4 months after inoculation 
and was associated with membranes, banding between 1.07 and 1.14 g/cm3 in 
isopycnic iodixanol gradients. Gradient fractions containing HAV RNA 
demonstrated no infectivity when inoculated into naive mice but contained 
neutralizing anti-HAV antibody. Depleting CD4+ or CD8+ T cells at this late 
point in infection had no effect on viral RNA abundance in the liver, whereas 
clodronate-liposome depletion of macrophages between days 110 and 120 
postinoculation resulted in a striking recrudescence of fecal virus shedding and 
the reappearance of viral RNA in serum coupled with reductions in intra-hepatic 
Ifnγ, Tnfα, Ccl5, and other chemokine transcripts. Our data suggest that 
replication-competent HAV RNA persists for months within the liver in the 
presence of neutralizing antibody following resolution of acute hepatitis in 
Ifnar1-/- mice and that macrophages play a key role in viral control late in 
infection. IMPORTANCE HAV RNA persists in the liver of infected chimpanzees and 
interferon receptor-deficient Ifnar1-/- mice for many months after neutralizing 
antibodies appear, virus has been cleared from the blood, and fecal virus 
shedding has terminated. Here, we show this viral RNA is located within 
hepatocytes and that the depletion of macrophages months after the resolution of 
hepatic inflammation restores fecal virus shedding and circulating viral RNA. 
Our study identifies an important role for macrophages in virus control 
following resolution of acute hepatitis A in Ifnar1-/- mice and may have 
relevance to relapsing hepatitis A in humans.

In a phase-IIa trial, we investigated the influence of 90 days 
continuous-delivery tenofovir (TFV) intravaginal rings (IVRs) with/without 
levonorgestrel (LNG) on the genital microbiota of Kenyan women. Eligible women 
(n = 27; 18-34 years; negative for HIV, sexually transmitted infections, and 
Amsel-bacterial vaginosis) were randomized 2:2:1 to use of IVRs containing TFV, 
TFV/LNG, or placebo. Using vaginal wall and IVR swabs at IVR insertion and 
removal, the genital microbial composition was determined using 16S rRNA gene 
sequencing. The presence of Candida spp. was determined using qPCR. The vaginal 
total bacterial burden appeared to decrease with TFV and TFV/LNG IVR use 
(log100.57 and log100.27 decrease respectively; p > 0.05). The TFV/LNG IVR was 
more 'stabilizing': 50% of the participants' microbiota community state types 
remained unchanged and 50% shifted towards higher Lactobacillus abundance. 
Specifically, TFV/LNG IVR use was accompanied by increased abundances of 
Lactobacillus gasseri/hominis/johnsonii/taiwanensis (16.3-fold) and L. 
fermentum/reuteri/vaginalis (7.0-fold; all p < 0.01). A significant shift in the 
overall microbial α-diversity or β-diversity was not observed for either IVR, 
and IVR use did not influence Candida spp. prevalence. TFV/LNG and TFV IVRs did 
not adversely affect the genital microbiota and are safe to use. Our findings 
support further studies assessing their efficacy in preventing HIV/HSV-2 and 
unintended pregnancies.

Transverse Relaxation Anisotropy of the Achilles and Patellar Tendon Studied by 
MR Microscopy.

A(4), Deligianni X(5)(6)(7), Bieri O(5)(6), Windhager R(2), Trattnig 
S(8)(9)(10), Juras V(8)(9)(10).

BACKGROUND: T2 * anisotropy affects the clinical assessment of tendons 
(magic-angle artifact) and may be a source of T2 *-misinterpretation.
PURPOSE: To analyze T2 *-anisotropy and T2 *-decay of Achilles and patellar 
tendons in vitro at microscopic resolution using a variable-echo-time (vTE) 
sequence.
STUDY TYPE: Prospective.
SPECIMEN: Four human Achilles and four patellar tendons.
FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: A 7 T MR-microscopy; 3D-vTE 
spoiled-gradient-echo-sequence (T2 *-mapping).
ASSESSMENT: All tendons were measured at 0° and 55° relative to B0 . Additional 
angles were measured for one Achilles and one patellar tendon for a total of 11 
angles ranging from 0° to 90°. T2 *-decay was analyzed with mono- and 
bi-exponential signal fitting. Mono-exponential T2 *-values (T2 *m ), short and 
long T2 *-components (T2 *s , T2 *l ), and the fraction of the short component 
Fs of the bi-exponential T2 *-fit were calculated. T2 *-decay characteristics 
were compared with morphological MRI and histologic findings based on a 
region-of-interest analysis.
STATISTICAL TESTS: Akaike information criterion (AICC ), F-test, and paired 
t-test. A P value smaller than the α-level of 0.05 was considered statistically 
significant.
RESULTS: T2 *m -values between fiber-to-field angles of 0° and 55° were 
increased on average from T2 *m (0°) = 1.92 msec to T2 *m (55°) = 29.86 msec 
(15.5-fold) in the Achilles and T2 *m (0°) = 1.46 msec to T2 *m 
(55°) = 23.33 msec (16.0-fold) in the patellar tendons. The changes in T2 *m 
-values were statistically significant. For the whole tendon, according to 
F-test and AICC , a bi-exponential model was preferred for angles close to 0°, 
while the mono-exponential model tended to be preferred at angles close to 55°.
CONCLUSION: MR-microscopy provides a deeper insight into the relationship 
between T2 *-decay (mono- vs. bi-exponential model) and tendon heterogeneity. 
Changes in fiber-to-field angle result in significant changes in T2 *-values. 
Thus, we conclude that awareness of T2 *-anisotropy should be noted in 
quantitative T2 *-mapping of tendons to avoid T2 *-misinterpretation such as a 
false positive detection of degeneration due to large fiber-to-field angles.

Bacterial Outer Membrane Polysaccharide Export (OPX) Proteins Occupy Three 
Structural Classes with Selective β-Barrel Porin Requirements for Polymer 
Secretion.

Saïdi F(#)(1)(2), Mahanta U(#)(3), Panda A(3), Kezzo AA(1)(2), Jolivet NY(1)(2), 
Bitazar R(1)(2), John G(4), Martinez M(5), Mellouk A(1)(2), Calmettes C(1)(2), 
Chang YW(5), Sharma G(3), Islam ST(1)(2).

Secretion of high-molecular-weight polysaccharides across the bacterial envelope 
is ubiquitous, as it enhances prokaryotic survival in (a)biotic settings. Such 
polymers are often assembled by Wzx/Wzy- or ABC transporter-dependent schemes 
implicating outer membrane (OM) polysaccharide export (OPX) proteins in 
cell-surface polymer translocation. In the social predatory bacterium Myxococcus 
xanthus, the exopolysaccharide (EPS) pathway WzaX, major spore coat (MASC) 
pathway WzaS, and biosurfactant polysaccharide (BPS) pathway WzaB were herein 
found to be truncated OPX homologues of Escherichia coli Wza lacking OM-spanning 
α-helices. Comparative genomics across all bacteria (>91,000 OPX proteins 
identified and analyzed), complemented with cryo-electron tomography 
cell-envelope analyses, revealed such "truncated" WzaX/S/B architecture to be 
the most common among three defined OPX-protein structural classes independent 
of periplasm thickness. Fold recognition and deep learning revealed the 
conserved M. xanthus proteins MXAN_7418/3226/1916 (encoded beside wzaX/S/B, 
respectively) to be integral OM β-barrels, with structural homology to the 
poly-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine synthase-dependent pathway porin PgaA. Such 
bacterial porins were identified near numerous genes for all three OPX protein 
classes. Interior MXAN_7418/3226/1916 β-barrel electrostatics were found to 
match properties of their associated polymers. With MXAN_3226 essential for MASC 
export, and MXAN_7418 herein shown to mediate EPS translocation, we have 
designated this new secretion machinery component "Wzp" (i.e., Wz porin), with 
the final step of M. xanthus EPS/MASC/BPS secretion across the OM now proposed 
to be mediated by WzpX/S/B (i.e., MXAN_7418/3226/1916). Importantly, these data 
support a novel and widespread secretion paradigm for polysaccharide 
biosynthesis pathways in which those containing OPX components that cannot span 
the OM instead utilize β-barrel porins to mediate polysaccharide transport 
across the OM. IMPORTANCE Diverse bacteria assemble and secrete polysaccharides 
that alter their physiologies through modulation of motility, biofilm formation, 
and host immune system evasion. Most such pathways require outer membrane (OM) 
polysaccharide export (OPX) proteins for sugar-polymer transport to the cell 
surface. In the prototypic Escherichia coli Group-1-capsule biosynthesis system, 
eight copies of this canonical OPX protein cross the OM with an α-helix, forming 
a polysaccharide-export pore. Herein, we instead reveal that most OPX proteins 
across all bacteria lack this α-helix, raising questions as to the manner by 
which most secreted polysaccharides actually exit cells. In the model 
developmental bacterium Myxococcus xanthus, we show this process to depend on 
OPX-coupled OM-spanning β-barrel porins, with similar porins encoded near 
numerous OPX genes in diverse bacteria. Knowledge of the terminal polysaccharide 
secretion step will enable development of antimicrobial compounds targeted to 
blocking polymer export from outside the cell, thus bypassing any requirements 
for antimicrobial compound uptake by the cell.

SiGe quantum wells with oscillating Ge concentrations for quantum dot qubits.

Joynt R(1), Eriksson MA(4).

Large-scale arrays of quantum-dot spin qubits in Si/SiGe quantum wells require 
large or tunable energy splittings of the valley states associated with 
degenerate conduction band minima. Existing proposals to deterministically 
enhance the valley splitting rely on sharp interfaces or modifications in the 
quantum well barriers that can be difficult to grow. Here, we propose and 
demonstrate a new heterostructure, the "Wiggle Well", whose key feature is Ge 
concentration oscillations inside the quantum well. Experimentally, we show that 
placing Ge in the quantum well does not significantly impact our ability to form 
and manipulate single-electron quantum dots. We further observe large and widely 
tunable valley splittings, from 54 to 239 μeV. Tight-binding calculations, and 
the tunability of the valley splitting, indicate that these results can mainly 
be attributed to random concentration fluctuations that are amplified by the 
presence of Ge alloy in the heterostructure, as opposed to a deterministic 
enhancement due to the concentration oscillations. Quantitative predictions for 
several other heterostructures point to the Wiggle Well as a robust method for 
reliably enhancing the valley splitting in future qubit devices.

Molecular Assessments, Statistical Effectiveness Parameters and Genetic 
Structure of Captive Populations of Tursiops truncatus Using 15 STRs.

Genetic analysis is a conventional way of identifying and monitoring captive and 
wildlife species. Knowledge of statistical parameters reinforcing their 
usefulness and effectiveness as powerful tools for preserving diversity is 
crucial. Although several studies have reported the diversity of cetaceans such 
as Tursiops truncatus using microsatellites, its informative degree has been 
poorly reported. Furthermore, the genetic structure of this cetacean has not 
been fully studied. In the present study, we selected 15 microsatellites with 
which 210 dolphins were genetically characterized using capillary 
electrophoresis. The genetic assertiveness of this set of hypervariable markers 
identified one individual in the range of 6.927e13 to 1.806e16, demonstrating 
its substantial capability in kinship relationships. The genetic structure of 
these 210 dolphins was also determined regarding the putative capture origin; a 
genetic stratification (k = 2) was found. An additional dolphin group of 
undetermined origin was also characterized to challenge the proficiency of our 
chosen markers. The set of markers proposed herein could be a helpful tool to 
guarantee the maintenance of the genetic diversity rates in conservation 
programs both in Tursiops truncatus and across other odontocetes, Mysticeti and 
several genera of endangered and vulnerable species.

Can Forest Management Practices Counteract Species Loss Arising from Increasing 
European Demand for Forest Biomass under Climate Mitigation Scenarios?

Rosa F(1), Di Fulvio F(2), Lauri P(2), Felton A(3), Forsell N(2), Pfister S(1), 
Hellweg S(1).

Forests are home to many species and provide biomass for material and energy. 
Here, we modeled the potential global species extinction risk from future 
scenarios of climate mitigation and EU28 forest management. We considered the 
continuation of current practices, the adoption of closer-to-nature management 
(low-intensity practices), and set-asides (conversion to unharvested forestland) 
on portions of EU28 forestland under two climate mitigation pathways as well as 
the consequences for the wood trade. Expanding set-aside to more than 25% of 
EU28 currently managed forestland by 2100 increased the global extinction risk 
compared to the continuation of current practices. This outcome stems from a 
projected increase in EU forest biomass imports, partially from 
biodiversity-vulnerable regions to compensate for a decrease in domestic 
harvest. Conversely, closer-to-nature management on up to 37.5% of EU28 
forestland lowered extinction risks. Increasing the internal production and 
partially sourcing imported biomass from low-intensity managed areas lowered the 
species extinction footprint even further. However, low-intensity practices 
could not entirely compensate for the increased extinction risk under a high 
climate mitigation scenario with greater demand for lignocellulosic crops and 
energywood. When developing climate mitigation strategies, it is crucial to 
assess forest biomass supply chains for the early detection of extinction risks 
in non-EU regions and for developing strategies to prevent increase of global 
impacts.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The biologic mechanisms underlying neurologic 
postacute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) infection (PASC) are incompletely understood.
METHODS: We measured markers of neurologic injury (glial fibrillary acidic 
protein [GFAP], neurofilament light chain [NfL]) and soluble markers of 
inflammation among a cohort of people with prior confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection 
at early and late recovery after the initial illness (defined as less than and 
greater than 90 days, respectively). The primary clinical outcome was the 
presence of self-reported CNS PASC symptoms during the late recovery time point. 
We compared fold changes in marker values between those with and without CNS 
PASC symptoms using linear mixed-effects models and examined relationships 
between neurologic and immunologic markers using rank linear correlations.
RESULTS: Of 121 individuals, 52 reported CNS PASC symptoms. During early 
recovery, those who went on to report CNS PASC symptoms had elevations in GFAP 
(1.3-fold higher mean ratio, 95% CI 1.04-1.63, p = 0.02), but not NfL (1.06-fold 
higher mean ratio, 95% CI 0.89-1.26, p = 0.54). During late recovery, neither 
GFAP nor NfL levels were elevated among those with CNS PASC symptoms. Although 
absolute levels of NfL did not differ, those who reported CNS PASC symptoms 
demonstrated a stronger downward trend over time in comparison with those who 
did not report CNS PASC symptoms (p = 0.041). Those who went on to report CNS 
PASC also exhibited elevations in interleukin 6 (48% higher during early 
recovery and 38% higher during late recovery), monocyte chemoattractant protein 
1 (19% higher during early recovery), and tumor necrosis factor α (19% higher 
during early recovery and 13% higher during late recovery). GFAP and NfL 
correlated with levels of several immune activation markers during early 
recovery; these correlations were attenuated during late recovery.
DISCUSSION: Self-reported neurologic symptoms present approximately 4 months 
after SARS-CoV-2 infection are associated with elevations in markers of 
neurologic injury and inflammation at earlier time points. Some inflammatory 
pathways seem to be involved months after acute infection. Additional work will 
be needed to better characterize these processes and to identify interventions 
to prevent or treat this condition.

Mycolactone: A Broad Spectrum Multitarget Antiviral Active in the Picomolar 
Range for COVID-19 Prevention and Cure.

Durvasula R(2), Kempaiah P(2), Kwofie SK(6), Wilson MD(1).

We have previously shown computationally that Mycolactone (MLN), a toxin 
produced by Mycobacterium ulcerans, strongly binds to Munc18b and other 
proteins, presumably blocking degranulation and exocytosis of blood platelets 
and mast cells. We investigated the effect of MLN on endocytosis using similar 
approaches, and it bound strongly to the N-terminal of the clathrin protein and 
a novel SARS-CoV-2 fusion protein. Experimentally, we found 100% inhibition up 
to 60 nM and 84% average inhibition at 30 nM in SARS-CoV-2 live viral assays. 
MLN was also 10× more potent than remdesivir and molnupiravir. MLN's toxicity 
against human alveolar cell line A549, immortalized human fetal renal cell line 
HEK293, and human hepatoma cell line Huh7.1 were 17.12%, 40.30%, and 36.25%, 
respectively. The cytotoxicity IC50 breakpoint ratio versus anti-SARS-CoV-2 
activity was more than 65-fold. The IC50 values against the alpha, delta, and 
Omicron variants were all below 0.020 µM, and 134.6 nM of MLN had 100% 
inhibition in an entry and spread assays. MLN is eclectic in its actions through 
its binding to Sec61, AT2R, and the novel fusion protein, making it a good drug 
candidate for treating and preventing COVID-19 and other similarly transmitted 
enveloped viruses and pathogens.

Marine bacteroidetes use a conserved enzymatic cascade to digest diatom 
β-mannan.

The polysaccharide β-mannan, which is common in terrestrial plants but unknown 
in microalgae, was recently detected during diatom blooms. We identified a 
β-mannan polysaccharide utilization locus (PUL) in the genome of the marine 
flavobacterium Muricauda sp. MAR_2010_75. Proteomics showed β-mannan induced 
translation of 22 proteins encoded within the PUL. Biochemical and structural 
analyses deduced the enzymatic cascade for β-mannan utilization. A conserved 
GH26 β-mannanase with endo-activity depolymerized the β-mannan. Consistent with 
the biochemistry, X-ray crystallography showed the typical TIM-barrel fold of 
related enzymes found in terrestrial β-mannan degraders. Structural and 
biochemical analyses of a second GH26 allowed the prediction of an exo-activity 
on shorter manno-gluco oligosaccharides. Further analysis demonstrated 
exo-α-1,6-galactosidase- and endo-β-1,4-glucanase activity of the PUL-encoded 
GH27 and GH5_26, respectively, indicating the target substrate is a 
galactoglucomannan. Epitope deletion assays with mannanases as analytic tools 
indicate the presence of β-mannan in the diatoms Coscinodiscus wailesii and 
Chaetoceros affinis. Mannanases from the PUL were active on diatom β-mannan and 
polysaccharide extracts sampled during a microalgal bloom at the North Sea. 
Together these results demonstrate that marine microorganisms use a conserved 
enzymatic cascade to degrade β-mannans of marine and terrestrial origin and that 
this metabolic pathway plays a role in marine carbon cycling.

To diminish chemical waste and improve the delivery of Curcuma longa L. (CL) 
constituents, microemulsions based on hydrophobic deep eutectic solvents (HDESs) 
were designed as ready-to-use solvents for CL extraction. The microemulsion (ME) 
of the ME-23 formulation (HDES/Tween 80 : propylene glycol (1 : 1)/water, 
25/70/5) displayed CL extraction yields of 1.69, 3.04, 7.36, and 1.39 wt% of 
bisdemethoxycurcumin, demethoxycurcumin, curcumin, and aromatic-turmerone, 
respectively. The ME-23 without CL chemical constituents and ME-23-based CL 
extract inhibited NO production with an IC50 value of 0.0136 ± 0.0023%v/v and a 
curcumin IC50 value of 75.2 ± 6.7 nM, respectively, and simultaneously lowered 
inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1β 
production in lipopolysaccharide-activated murine macrophages. Authentic 
curcumin in ME-23 possessed superior NO inhibitory activity, which was 103-fold 
more effective than curcumin prepared in the conventional solvent dimethyl 
sulfoxide. ME-23 was also capable of delivering curcumin into murine 
macrophages. After 30 days of storage in HDES and HDES-based ME, curcumin 
remained more than 90%. ME-23 provides advantages for CL extraction, constituent 
delivery, and anti-inflammatory functions that can be applied to pharmaceutical 
and cosmetic products.

A preoperative model based on gadobenate-enhanced MRI for predicting 
microvascular invasion in hepatocellular carcinomas (≤ 5 cm).

Zhang S(1), Huo L(1), Zhang J(1), Feng Y(1), Liu Y(1), Wu Y(1), Jia N(1), Liu 
W(2).

PURPOSE: The present study aimed to develop and validate a preoperative model 
based on gadobenate-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for predicting 
microvascular invasion (MVI) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
size of ≤5 cm. In order to provide preoperative guidance for clinicians to 
optimize treatment options.
METHODS: 164 patients with pathologically confirmed HCC and preoperative 
gadobenate-enhanced MRI from July 2016 to December 2020 were retrospectively 
included. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression (forward LR) analyses 
were used to determine the predictors of MVI and the model was established. 
Four-fold cross validation was used to verify the model, which was visualized by 
nomograms. The predictive performance of the model was evaluated based on 
discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility.
RESULTS: Elevated alpha-fetoprotein (HR 1.849, 95% CI: 1.193, 2.867, P=0.006), 
atypical enhancement pattern (HR 3.441, 95% CI: 1.523, 7.772, P=0.003), 
peritumoral hypointensity on HBP (HR 7.822, 95% CI: 3.317, 18.445, P<0.001), and 
HBP hypointensity (HR 3.258, 95% CI: 1.381, 7.687, P=0.007) were independent 
risk factors to MVI and constituted the HBP model. The mean area under the curve 
(AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy values for the HBP model were as 
follows: 0.830 (95% CI: 0.784, 0.876), 0.71, 0.78, 0.81 in training set; 0.826 
(95% CI:0.765, 0.887), 0.8, 0.7, 0.79 in test set. The decision curve analysis 
(DCA) curve showed that the HBP model achieved great clinical benefits.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the HBP imaging features of Gd-BOPTA-enhanced MRI 
play an important role in predicting MVI for HCC. A preoperative model, mainly 
based on HBP imaging features of gadobenate-enhanced MRI, was able to 
excellently predict the MVI for HCC size of ≤5cm. The model may help clinicians 
preoperatively assess the risk of MVI in HCC patients so as to guide clinicians 
to optimize treatment options.

Liver-specific overexpression of lipoprotein lipase improves glucose metabolism 
in high-fat diet-fed mice.

T(1), Terada T(1), Sakurai F(3), Mizuguchi H(3)(4)(5)(6), Tomita K(7), Nishinaka 
T(1).

The liver is the main organ that regulates lipid and glucose metabolism. Ectopic 
lipid accumulation in the liver impairs insulin sensitivity and glucose 
metabolism. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL), mainly expressed in the adipose tissue and 
muscle, is a key enzyme that regulates lipid metabolism via the hydrolysis of 
triglyceride in chylomicrons and very-low-density lipoproteins. Here, we aimed 
to investigate whether the suppression level of hepatic lipid accumulation via 
overexpression of LPL in mouse liver leads to improved metabolism. To 
overexpress LPL in the liver, we generated an LPL-expressing adenovirus (Ad) 
vector using an improved Ad vector that exhibited considerably lower 
hepatotoxicity (Ad-LPL). C57BL/6 mice were treated with Ad vectors and 
simultaneously fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Lipid droplet formation in the liver 
decreased in Ad-LPL-treated mice relative to that in control Ad vector-treated 
mice. Glucose tolerance and insulin resistance were remarkably improved in 
Ad-LPL-treated mice compared to those in control Ad vector-treated mice. The 
expression levels of fatty acid oxidation-related genes, such as peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor α, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, and 
acyl-CoA oxidase 1, were 1.7-2.0-fold higher in Ad-LPL-treated mouse livers than 
that in control Ad-vector-treated mouse livers. Furthermore, hepatic LPL 
overexpression partly maintained mitochondrial content in HFD-fed mice. These 
results indicate that LPL overexpression in the livers of HFD-fed mice 
attenuates the accumulation of lipid droplets in the liver and improves glucose 
metabolism. These findings may enable the development of new drugs to treat 
metabolic syndromes such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and non-alcoholic fatty 
liver disease.

pressure regulation.

M(3), Suhre K(4), Padmanabhan S(5), Menni C(6).

BACKGROUND: Association studies have identified several biomarkers for blood 
pressure and hypertension, but a thorough understanding of their mutual 
dependencies is lacking. By integrating two different high-throughput datasets, 
biochemical and dietary data, we aim to understand the multifactorial 
contributors of blood pressure (BP).
METHODS: We included 4,863 participants from TwinsUK with concurrent BP, 
metabolomics, genomics, biochemical measures, and dietary data. We used 5-fold 
cross-validation with the machine learning XGBoost algorithm to identify 
features of importance in context of one another in TwinsUK (80% training, 20% 
test). The features tested in TwinsUK were then probed using the same algorithm 
in an independent dataset of 2,807 individuals from the Qatari Biobank (QBB).
FINDINGS: Our model explained 39·2% [4·5%, MAE:11·32 mmHg (95%CI, +/- 0·65)] of 
the variance in systolic BP (SBP) in TwinsUK. Of the top 50 features, the most 
influential non-demographic variables were dihomo-linolenate, cis-4-decenoyl 
carnitine, lactate, chloride, urate, and creatinine along with dietary intakes 
of total, trans and saturated fat. We also highlight the incremental value of 
each included dimension. Furthermore, we replicated our model in the QBB [SBP 
variance explained = 45·2% (13·39%)] cohort and 30 of the top 50 features 
overlapped between cohorts.
INTERPRETATION: We show that an integrated analysis of omics, biochemical and 
dietary data improves our understanding of their in-between relationships and 
expands the range of potential biomarkers for blood pressure. Our results point 
to potentially key biological pathways to be prioritised for mechanistic 
studies.

Human Serum Amyloid a Impaired Structural Stability of High-Density Lipoproteins 
(HDL) and Apolipoprotein (Apo) A-I and Exacerbated Glycation Susceptibility of 
ApoA-I and HDL.

Cho KH(1)(2).

Human serum amyloid A (SAA) is an exchangeable apolipoprotein (apo) in 
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) that influences HDL quality and functionality, 
particularly in the acute phase of inflammation. On the other hand, the 
structural and functional correlations of HDL containing SAA and apoA-I have not 
been reported. The current study was designed to compare the change in HDL 
quality with increasing SAA content in the lipid-free and lipid-bound states in 
reconstituted HDL (rHDL). The expressed recombinant human SAA1 (13 kDa) was 
purified to at least 98% and characterized in the lipid-free and lipid-bound 
states with apoA-I. The dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) binding ability 
of apoA-I was impaired severely by the addition of SAA, while SAA alone could 
not bind with DMPC. The recombinant human SAA1 was incorporated into the rHDL 
(molar ratio 95:5:1, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC): 
cholesterol: apoA-I) with various apoA-I:SAA molar ratios from 1:0 to 1:0.5, 1:1 
and 1:2. With increasing SAA1 content, the rHDL particle size was reduced from 
98 Å to 93 Å, and the α-helicity of apoA-I:SAA was decreased from 73% to 40% for 
(1:0) and (1:2), respectively. The wavelength maximum fluorescence (WMF) of 
tryptophan in rHDL was red-shifted from 339 nm to 345 nm for (1:0) and (1:2) of 
apoA-I:SAA, respectively, indicating that the addition of SAA to rHDL 
destabilized the secondary structure of apoA-I. Upon denaturation by urea 
treatment from 0 M to 8 M, SAA showed only a 3 nm red-shift in WMF, while apoA-I 
showed a 16 nm red-shift in WMF, indicating that SAA is resistant to 
denaturation and apoA-I had higher conformational flexibility than SAA. The 
glycation reaction of apoA-I in the presence of fructose was accelerated up to 
1.8-fold by adding SAA in a dose-dependent manner than that of apoA-I alone. In 
conclusion, the incorporation of SAA in rHDL impaired the structural stability 
of apoA-I and exacerbated glycation of HDL and apoA-I.

Low expression of exosomal miR-150 predicts poor prognosis in colorectal cancer 
patients after surgical resections.

Zhang Y(1), Liu WS(1)(2), Zhang XY(3)(4)(5), Tong HX(1), Yang H(2), Liu 
WF(3)(4)(5), Fan J(3)(4)(5)(6), Zhou J(3)(4)(5)(6), Hu J(3)(4)(5).

Liver metastasis is a leading indicator of poor prognosis in patients with 
colorectal cancer (CRC). Exosomal intercellular communication has been reported 
to play an important role in cancer invasion and metastasis. Here, we 
characterized exosomal miRNAs underlying liver metastasis in CRC patients 
(Cohort 1, n = 30) using miRNA arrays. Exosomal miR-150 was found to be 
downregulated in CRC patients with liver metastases compared to those without (P 
= 0.025, fold change [FC] = 2.01). These results were then validated using 
another independent cohort of CRC patients (Cohort 2, n = 64). Patients with low 
expression of exosomal miR-150 had significantly shorter overall survival (OS) 
time (33.3 months versus 43.3 months, P = 0.002). In addition, the low 
expression of exosomal miR-150 was significantly correlated with advanced tumor 
node metastasis staging (P = 0.013), higher CA199 level (P = 0.018), and the 
presence of liver metastasis (P = 0.048). Multivariate analysis showed that low 
expression of exosomal miR-150 (P = 0.035) and liver metastasis (P < 0.001) were 
independent prognostic factors for overall survival. In vivo and in vitro 
studies showed that the viability and invasion of CRC cells were both 
significantly suppressed by ExomiR-150. Target-prediction assessment and 
dual-luciferase reporter assay indicated that FTO (the fat mass and 
obesity-associated gene) was a direct target for miR-150. This study first 
demonstrated that exosomal miR-150 may be a potential prognostic factor and 
treatment target for CRC.

Radiomics on Gadoxetate Disodium-enhanced MRI: Non-invasively Identifying 
Glypican 3-Positive Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Postoperative Recurrence.

Chong H(1), Gong Y(2), Zhang Y(3), Dai Y(3), Sheng R(1), Zeng M(4).

RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the impact of preoperative gadoxetate 
disodium (EOB) MRI-based radiomics on predicting glypican 3 (GPC3)-positive 
expression and the relevant recurrence-free survival (RFS) of HCC ≤ 5 cm.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 2014 and October 2018, 259 patients with 
solitary HCC ≤ 5 cm who underwent hepatectomy and preoperative EOB-MRI were 
retrieved. Multivariate logistic regression was implemented to identify 
independent predictors for GPC3. By combining five feature selection strategies 
and three classifiers, 15 GPC3-oriented radiomics models could be constructed, 
the best of which with independent clinicoradiologic predictors was integrated 
into the comprehensive nomogram.
RESULTS: GPC3 was an independent risk factor of postoperative recrudescence for 
HCC. Alpha-fetoprotein >20 ng/mL, homogenous T2 signal and hypointensity on 
hepatobiliary phase were independently related to GPC3-positive expression in 
the clinicoradiologic model. With 10 features selected by support vector 
machines-recursive feature elimination, logistic regression-based classifier 
achieved the best performance among 15 radiomics models. After five-fold 
cross-validation, our comprehensive nomogram acquired better average area under 
receiver operating characteristic curves (training and validation cohorts: 0.931 
vs. 0.943) than the clinicoradiologic algorithm (0.738 vs. 0.739) and the 
optimal radiomics model (0.943 vs. 0.931). Net reclassification indexes further 
demonstrated the superiority of GPC3 nomogram over clinicoradiologic and 
radiomics algorithms (46.54%, p < 0.001; 7.84%, p = 0.207). Meanwhile, higher 
radiomics score significantly shortened the median RFS (from >77.9 to 48.2 
months, p = 0.044), which was analogue to that of the histological GPC3-positive 
phenotype (from >73.9 to 43.2 months, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative EOB-MRI radiomics-based nomogram satisfactorily 
distinguished GPC3 status and outcomes of solitary HCC ≤ 5 cm.

Transglutaminase-Catalyzed Glycosylation Improved Physicochemical and Functional 
Properties of Lentinus edodes Protein Fraction.

Wu SS(1), Han W(1), Cheng YF(1), Yun SJ(1), Chang MC(1), Cheng FE(1)(2), Cao 
JL(1), Feng CP(2)(3).

Lentinula edodes has high nutritional value and abundant protein. In order to 
develop and utilize edible mushroom protein, this study was designed to 
investigate the effects of TGase-catalyzed glycosylation and cross-linking on 
the physicochemical and functional properties of Lentinus edodes protein 
fraction. The results showed that within a certain time, glycosylation and 
TGase-catalyzed glycosylation decreased the total sulfydryl, free sulfydryl, 
disulfide bond, surface hydrophobicity, β-fold and α-helix, but increased the 
fluorescence intensity, random coil, β-turn, particle size and thermal 
stability. The apparent viscosity and the shear stress of the protein with an 
increase in shear rate were increased, indicating that TGase-catalyzed 
glycosylation promoted the generation of cross-linked polymers. In addition, the 
TGase-catalyzed glycosylated proteins showed a compact texture structure similar 
to the glycosylated proteins at the beginning, indicating that they formed a 
stable three-dimensional network structure. The flaky structure of proteins 
became more and more obvious with time. Moreover, the solubility, 
emulsification, stability and oil-holding capacity of enzymatic glycosylated 
Lentinus edodes protein fraction were significantly improved because of the 
proper TGase effects of glycosylation grafting and cross-linking. These results 
showed that glycosylation and TGase-catalyzed glycosylation could improve the 
processing characteristics of the Lentinula edodes protein fraction to varying 
degrees.

Al-Mamoori ZZ(1), Embaby AM(2), Hussein A(1), Mahmoud HE(1).

Erratum in
    AMB Express. 2023 Jun 7;13(1):54.

Despite the great potential of cold-adapted pullulanase type I in tremendous 
industrial applications, the majority of commercialized pullulnases type I are 
of mesophilic and thermophilic origin so far. Hence, the present study 
underlines cloning, heterologous expression in Escherichia coli, 
characterization, and in silico structural modeling of Metabacillus indicus open 
reading frame of cold-adapted pullulanase type I (Pull_Met: 2133 bp & 710 a.a) 
for the first time ever. The predicted Pull_Met tertiary structure by I-TASSER, 
was structurally similar to PDB 2E9B pullulanase of Bacillus subtilis. Purified 
to homogeneity Pull_Met showed specific activity (667.6 U/mg), fold purification 
(31.7), molecular mass (79.1 kDa), monomeric subunit and Km (2.63 mg/mL) on 
pullulan. Pull_Met had optimal pH (6.0) and temperature (40 oC). After 10 h 
pre-incubation at pH 2.6-6.0, Pull_Met maintained 47.12 ± 0.0-35.28 ± 1.64% of 
its activity. After 120 min pre-incubation at 30 oC, the retained activity was 
51.11 ± 0.29%. At 10 mM Mn2+, Na2+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and Cu2+ after 30 min 
preincubation, retained activity was 155.89 ± 8.97, 134.71 ± 1.82, 97.64 ± 7.06, 
92.25 ± 4.18, and 71.28 ± 1.10%, respectively. After 30 min pre-incubation with 
Tween-80, Tween-20, Triton X-100, and commercially laundry detergents at 0.1% 
(v/v), the retained activity was 141.15 ± 3.50, 145.45 ± 0.20, 118.12 ± 11.00, 
and 90%, respectively. Maltotriose was the only end product of pullulan 
hydrolysis. Synergistic action of CA-AM21 (α-amylase) and Pull_Met on starch 
liberated 16.51 g reducing sugars /g starch after 1 h at 40 oC. Present data 
(cold-adeptness, detergent stability, and ability to exhibit starch 
saccharification of Pull_Met) underpins it as a promising pullulanase type I for 
industrial exploitation.

Anti-Diabetic Therapy and Heart Failure: Recent Advances in Clinical Evidence 
and Molecular Mechanism.

Hsu CN(1), Hsuan CF(2)(3)(4), Liao D(5), Chang JK(6), Chang AJ(5), Hee SW(7), 
Lee HL(5), Teng SIF(8).

Diabetic patients have a two- to four-fold increase in the risk of heart failure 
(HF), and the co-existence of diabetes and HF is associated with poor prognosis. 
In randomized clinical trials (RCTs), compelling evidence has demonstrated the 
beneficial effects of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors on HF. The 
mechanism includes increased glucosuria, restored tubular glomerular feedback 
with attenuated renin-angiotensin II-aldosterone activation, improved energy 
utilization, decreased sympathetic tone, improved mitochondria calcium 
homeostasis, enhanced autophagy, and reduced cardiac inflammation, oxidative 
stress, and fibrosis. The RCTs demonstrated a neutral effect of the 
glucagon-like peptide receptor agonist on HF despite its weight-reducing effect, 
probably due to it possibly increasing the heart rate via increasing cyclic 
adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Observational studies supported the markedly 
beneficial effects of bariatric and metabolic surgery on HF despite no current 
supporting evidence from RCTs. Bromocriptine can be used to treat peripartum 
cardiomyopathy by reducing the harmful cleaved prolactin fragments during late 
pregnancy. Preclinical studies suggest the possible beneficial effect of 
imeglimin on HF through improving mitochondrial function, but further clinical 
evidence is needed. Although abundant preclinical and observational studies 
support the beneficial effects of metformin on HF, there is limited evidence 
from RCTs. Thiazolidinediones increase the risk of hospitalized HF through 
increasing renal tubular sodium reabsorption mediated via both the genomic and 
non-genomic action of PPARγ. RCTs suggest that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 
inhibitors, including saxagliptin and possibly alogliptin, may increase the risk 
of hospitalized HF, probably owing to increased circulating vasoactive peptides, 
which impair endothelial function, activate sympathetic tones, and cause cardiac 
remodeling. Observational studies and RCTs have demonstrated the neutral effects 
of insulin, sulfonylureas, an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, and lifestyle 
interventions on HF in diabetic patients.

Atomistic Simulations of the Crystalline-to-Amorphous Transformation of 
γ-Al(2)O(3) Nanoparticles: Delicate Interplay between Lattice Distortions, 
Stresses, and Space Charges.

Gramatte S(1)(2)(3), Jeurgens LPH(2), Politano O(3), Simon Greminger JA(1), 
Baras F(3), Xomalis A(4), Turlo V(1).

The size-dependent phase stability of γ-Al2O3 was studied by large-scale 
molecular dynamics simulations over a wide temperature range from 300 to 900 K. 
For the γ-Al2O3 crystal, a bulk transformation to α-Al2O3 by an FCC-to-HCP 
transition of the O sublattice is still kinetically hindered at 900 K. However, 
local distortions of the FCC O-sublattice by the formation of quasi-octahedral 
Al local coordination spheres become thermally activated, as driven by the 
partial covalency of the Al-O bond. On the contrary, spherical γ-Al2O3 
nanoparticles (NPs) (with sizes of 6 and 10 nm) undergo a 
crystalline-to-amorphous transformation at 900 K, which starts at the 
reconstructed surface and propagates into the core through collective 
displacements of anions and cations, resulting in the formation of 7- and 8-fold 
local coordination spheres of Al. In parallel, the reconstructed Al-enriched 
surface is separated from the stoichiometric core by a diffuse Al-depleted 
transition region. This compositional heterogeneity creates an imbalance of 
charges inside the NP, which induces a net attractive Coulombic force that is 
strong enough to reverse the initial stress state in the NP core from 
compressive to tensile. These findings disclose the delicate interplay between 
lattice distortions, stresses, and space-charge regions in oxide nanosystems. A 
fundamental explanation for the reported expansion of metal-oxide NPs with 
decreasing size is provided, which has significant implications for, e.g., 
heterogeneous catalysis, NP sintering, and additive manufacturing of 
NP-reinforced metal matrix composites.

pH-Sensitive and Biodegradable Mn(3)(PO(4))(2)·3H(2)O Nanoparticles as an 
Adjuvant of Protein-Based Bivalent COVID-19 Vaccine to Induce Potent and 
Broad-Spectrum Immunity.

Developing a novel and potent adjuvant with great biocompatibility for immune 
response augmentation is of great significance to enhance vaccine efficacy. In 
this work, we prepared a long-term stable, pH-sensitive, and biodegradable 
Mn3(PO4)2·3H2O nanoparticle (nano-MnP) by simply mixing MnCl2/NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4 
solution for the first time and employed it as an immune stimulant in the 
bivalent COVID-19 protein vaccine comprised of wild-type S1 (S1-WT) and Omicron 
S1 (S1-Omicron) proteins as antigens to elicit a broad-spectrum immunity. The 
biological experiments indicated that the nano-MnP could effectively activate 
antigen-presenting cells through the cGAS-STING pathway. Compared with the 
conventional Alum-adjuvanted group, the nano-MnP-adjuvanted bivalent vaccine 
elicited approximately 7- and 8-fold increases in IgG antibody titers and 
antigen-specific IFN-γ secreting T cells, respectively. Importantly, antisera of 
the nano-MnP-adjuvanted group could effectively cross-neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 
and its five variants of concern (VOCs) including Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and 
Omicron, demonstrating that this bivalent vaccine based on S1-WT and S1-Omicron 
proteins is an effective vaccine design strategy to induce broad-spectrum immune 
responses. Collectively, this nano-MnP material may provide a novel and 
efficient adjuvant platform for various prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines 
and provide insights for the development of the next-generation manganese 
adjuvant.

fabrication of biomedical appliances. Although PMMA has several advantages, it 
is susceptible to microbial insults with practical use. Therefore, different 
bioactive nanomaterials, such as nanoceria (CeN), have been proposed to enhance 
the properties of PMMA. In this study, we investigated the effect of the 
incorporation of CeN into PMMA with and without the use of mesoporous silica 
nanoparticle (SBA-15) carriers. The unmodified PMMA specimens (control, CTRL) 
were compared to groups containing SBA-15, CeN, and the synthesized SBA-15 
impregnated with CeN (SBA-15@CeN) at different loading percentages. The 
mechanical and physical properties of the different SBA-15@CeN groups and their 
effects on cell viability were investigated, and the optimal CeN concentration 
was identified accordingly. Our results revealed that flexural strength was 
significantly (P < 0.01) reduced in the SBA-15@CeN3× group (containing 3-fold 
the CeN wt. %). Although the surface microhardness increased with the increase 
in the wt. % of SBA-15@CeN, cell viability was significantly reduced 
(P < 0.001). The SBA-15@CeN1× group had the optimal concentration and displayed 
significant resistance to single-and multispecies microbial colonization. 
Finally, the enzymatic activity of CeN was significantly high in the 
SBA-15@CeN1× group. The proinflammatory markers (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, CD80, and 
CD86) showed a significant (P < 0.001) multifold reduction in 
lipopolysaccharide-induced RAW cells treated with a 5-day eluate of the 
SBA-15@CeN1× group. These results indicate that the addition of SBA-15@CeN at 
1.5 wt % improves the biological response of PMMA without compromising its 
mechanical properties.

Characterization of two 1,3-β-glucan-modifying enzymes from Penicillium 
sumatraense reveals new insights into 1,3-β-glucan metabolism of fungal 
saprotrophs.

Scafati V(#)(1), Troilo F(#)(2), Ponziani S(1), Giovannoni M(1), Scortica A(1), 
Pontiggia D(3), Angelucci F(1), Di Matteo A(4), Mattei B(5), Benedetti M(1).

BACKGROUND: 1,3-β-glucan is a polysaccharide widely distributed in the cell wall 
of several phylogenetically distant organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, plants 
and microalgae. The presence of highly active 1,3-β-glucanases in fungi evokes 
the biological question on how these organisms can efficiently metabolize 
exogenous sources of 1,3-β-glucan without incurring in autolysis.
RESULTS: To elucidate the molecular mechanisms at the basis of 1,3-β-glucan 
metabolism in fungal saprotrophs, the putative exo-1,3-β-glucanase G9376 and a 
truncated form of the putative glucan endo-1,3-β-glucosidase (ΔG7048) from 
Penicillium sumatraense AQ67100 were heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris 
and characterized both in terms of activity and structure. G9376 efficiently 
converted laminarin and 1,3-β-glucan oligomers into glucose by acting as an 
exo-glycosidase, whereas G7048 displayed a 1,3-β-transglucanase/branching 
activity toward 1,3-β-glucan oligomers with a degree of polymerization higher 
than 5, making these oligomers more recalcitrant to the hydrolysis acted by 
exo-1,3-β-glucanase G9376. The X-ray crystallographic structure of the catalytic 
domain of G7048, solved at 1.9 Å of resolution, consists of a (β/α)8 TIM-barrel 
fold characteristic of all the GH17 family members. The catalytic site is in a 
V-shaped cleft containing the two conserved catalytic glutamic residues. 
Molecular features compatible with the activity of G7048 as 1,3-β-transglucanase 
are discussed.
CONCLUSIONS: The antagonizing activity between ΔG7048 and G9376 indicates how 
opportunistic fungi belonging to Penicillium genus can feed on substrates 
similar for composition and structure to their own cell wall without incurring 
in a self-deleterious autohydrolysis.

Identification of a novel fusion Iduronidase with improved activity in the 
cardiovascular system.

JR(1)(2).

BACKGROUND: Lysosomal diseases are a group of over 70 rare genetic conditions in 
which a protein deficiency (most often an enzyme deficiency) leads to 
multi-system disease. Current therapies for lysosomal diseases are limited in 
their ability to treat certain tissues that are major contributors to morbidity 
and mortality, such as the central nervous system (CNS) and cardiac valves. For 
this study, the lysosomal disease mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) was 
selected as the disease model. In MPS I, mutations in the IDUA gene cause a 
deficiency of the α-L-iduronidase (IDUA) enzyme activity, leading to disease 
pathology in tissues throughout the body, including the CNS and cardiac valves. 
Current therapies have been unable to prevent neurodevelopmental deficits and 
cardiac valvular disease in patients with MPS I. This study aimed to evaluate 
the delivery of IDUA enzyme, via a novel gene therapy construct, to target 
tissues.
METHODS: MPS I mice were hydrodynamically injected through the tail vein with 
plasmids containing either a codon-optimized cDNA encoding the wild-type IDUA 
protein or one of four modified IDUAs under the control of the liver-specific 
human α1-antitrypsin (hAAT) promoter. Two modified IDUAs contained a ligand for 
the CB1 receptor, which is a highly expressed receptor in the CNS. Iduronidase 
activity levels were measured in the tissues and plasma using an enzyme activity 
assay.
RESULTS: The modified IDUAs did not appear to have improved activity levels in 
the brain compared with the unmodified IDUA. However, one modified IDUA 
exhibited higher activity levels than the unmodified IDUA in the heart 
(p = 0.0211). This modified iduronidase (LT-IDUA) contained a sequence for a six 
amino acid peptide termed LT. LT-IDUA was further characterized using a 
noncompartmental pharmacokinetic approach that directly analyzed enzyme activity 
levels after gene delivery. LT-IDUA had a 2-fold higher area under the curve 
(AUC) than the unmodified IDUA (p = 0.0034) when AUC was estimated using enzyme 
activity levels in the plasma.
CONCLUSION: The addition of a six amino acid peptide improved iduronidase's 
activity levels in the heart and plasma. The short length of this LT peptide 
facilitates its use as fusion enzymes encoded as gene therapy or administered as 
enzyme replacement therapy. More broadly, the LT peptide may aid in developing 
therapies for numerous lysosomal diseases.

Enhanced half-life and antitumor activity of interleukin-15 through genetic 
fusion of a serum albumin-specific protein binder.

Kim D(1), Park JH(2), Kim TY(1), Kim DG(1), Byun JH(3), Kim HS(4).

Human interleukin-15 (hIL-15) has attracted a considerable attention as a 
promising cancer immunotherapeutic due to its function to directly stimulate the 
proliferation and cytotoxic activity of NK and T cells. Nevertheless, a 
relatively short half-life of hIL-15 requires repeated administration and higher 
doses, causing serious side effects. Here, we demonstrate an enhanced blood 
half-life and biological activity of hIL-15 through genetic fusion of a human 
serum albumin-specific protein binder (rHSA). The fusion construct (rHSA-IL15) 
was observed to maintain respective binding activities for both hIL-15 receptor 
α and human serum albumin. The rHSA-IL15 led to a significant increase in the 
secretion of Granzyme B and INF-γ by immune cells compare to free hIL-15, 
expanding the population of activated T cell subset such as CD4 + T and CD8+ T 
cells. The terminal half-life of the rHSA-IL15 was prolonged by around a 40-fold 
in transgenic mice expressing human serum albumin, compared to free hIL-15. The 
rHSA-IL15 resulted in distinct anti-tumor activities in xenograft SCC (squamous 
cell carcinoma) mouse and allograft melanoma mouse models through activation of 
NK and CD8+ T cells. The rHSA-IL15 is expected to be used in cancer 
immunotherapy, assisting in the development of other cytokines as 
immunotherapeutic agents with greater efficacy.

Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein in apo and holo conformation anchored to the 
membrane: comparative molecular dynamics simulations.

Caro-Gómez LA(1), Rosas-Trigueros JL(2), Mixcoha E(3), Zamorano-Carrillo A(4), 
Martínez-Martínez J(1), Benítez-Cardoza CG(4).

The interaction between the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein and its antagonist Bax 
is essential to the regulation of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. For 
this work, we built models by homology of Bcl-2 full-sequence length in 
monomeric form (apo-Bcl-2) and in complex with the BH3 domain of Bax 
(holo-Bcl-2). The Bcl-2 protein was analyzed with its transmembrane domain 
anchored to a lipidic bilayer of DPPC, imitating physiological conditions. We 
performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the GROMACS program. 
Conformational changes showed that the flexible loop domain (FLD) tends to fold 
on itself and move towards the main core. Furthermore, the BH3 peptide of 
pro-apoptotic protein Bax, showed an allosteric stabilizing effect on FLD upon 
being bound to the hydrophobic cleft of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, 
causing a reduction in its structural flexibility. However, FLD is distal from 
the main core of Bcl-2. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed a weak 
correlation between FLD residues and BH3 peptide from Bax. Upon MD simulations, 
several new contacts appeared between FLD and some α-helices of the core of 
Bcl-2, which contribute to maintaining the stability of Bcl-2. This knowledge 
sheds light on the behavior of Bcl-2 in the cell's native 
environment.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

Neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune response after two doses of 
inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in China.

Yan LN(1), Zhao ZX(2), Wang ZD(3), Xiao X(1), Liu PP(1), Zhang WK(1), Gu XL(1), 
Li B(1), Yu LP(4), Yu XJ(1).

BACKGROUND: As of 2022, inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines had been used in more 
than 91 countries. However, limited real world information was available on the 
immune responses of the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.
METHODS: We used SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirues to determine the neutralizing 
antibodies (NAbs) to wild type and several global variants and utilized 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to investigate IFN-γ-secreting T-cell 
responses to SARS-CoV-2 among 240 vaccinated individuals after two doses of 
inactivated vaccine in China.
RESULTS: A majority of the vaccinated (>90%) developed robust NAbs and T-cell 
responses to SARS-CoV-2 in the first two months after the second dose. After six 
months, only 37.0% and 44.0% of vaccinees had NAbs and T-cell immunity to 
SARS-CoV-2, respectively. Immune serum retained most of its neutralizing potency 
against the Alpha and Iota variants, but lost significant neutralizing potency 
against the Beta, Kappa, Delta, and Omicron variants. Only 40% of vaccine-sera 
retained low-level neutralization activities to Omicron, with a 14.7-fold 
decrease compared to the wild type.
CONCLUSION: The inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine stimulated robust NAbs and T-cell 
immune responses in the first two months after the second dose but the immune 
effect dropped rapidly, highlighing that a third dose or additional booster 
immunizations may be required to boost immunity against SARS-CoV-2.

Evodiamine decreased the systemic exposure of pravastatin in non-alcoholic 
steatohepatitis rats due to the up-regulation of hepatic OATPs.

Liang R(1)(2), Ge W(1), Li B(1)(2), Cui W(1), Ma X(1), Pan Y(1), Li G(1).

CONTEXT: Patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) may have a 
simultaneous intake of pravastatin and evodiamine-containing herbs.
OBJECTIVE: The effect of evodiamine on the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin and 
its potential mechanisms were investigated in NASH rats.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The NASH model was conducted with feeding a methionine 
choline-deficient (MCD) diet for 8 weeks. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomised 
equally (n = 6) into NASH group, evodiamine group (10 mg/kg), pravastatin group 
(10 mg/kg), and evodiamine (10 mg/kg) + pravastatin (10 mg/kg) group. Normal 
control rats were fed a standard diet. Effects of evodiamine on the 
pharmacokinetics, distribution, and uptake of pravastatin were investigated.
RESULTS: Evodiamine decreased Cmax (159.43 ± 26.63 vs. 125.61 ± 22.17 μg/L), 
AUC0-t (18.17 ± 2.52 vs. 14.91 ± 2.03 mg/min/L) and AUC0-∞ (22.99 ± 2.62 vs. 
19.50 ± 2.31 mg/min/L) of orally administered pravastatin in NASH rats, but had 
no significant effect in normal rats. Evodiamine enhanced the uptake (from 
154.85 ± 23.17 to 198.48 ± 26.31 pmol/mg protein) and distribution (from 
736.61 ± 108.07 to 911.89 ± 124.64 ng/g tissue) of pravastatin in NASH rat 
liver. The expression of Oatp1a1, Oatp1a4, and Oatp1b2 was up-regulated 1.48-, 
1.38-, and 1.51-fold by evodiamine. Evodiamine decreased the levels of IL-1β, 
IL-6, and TNF-α by 27.82%, 24.76%, and 29.72% in NASH rats, respectively.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Evodiamine decreased the systemic exposure of 
pravastatin by up-regulating the expression of OATPs. These results provide a 
reference for further validation of this interaction in humans.

Identifying the metabolome of human seminal plasma (HSP) is a new research area 
to screen putative biomarkers of infertility. This case-control study was 
performed on HSP specimens of 15 infertile patients with teratozoospermia 
(defined as normal sperm morphology < 4%) and 12 confirmed fertile 
normozoospermic men as the control group to investigate the seminal metabolic 
signature and whether there are differences in the metabolome between two 
groups. HSPs were subjected to LC-MS-MS analysis. MetaboAnalyst5.0 software was 
utilized for statistical analysis. Different univariate and multivariate 
analyses were used, including T-tests, fold change analysis, random forest (RF), 
and metabolite set enrichment analysis (MSEA). Teratozoospermic samples 
contained seventeen significantly different amino acids. Upregulated metabolites 
include glutamine, asparagine, and glycylproline, whereas downregulated 
metabolites include cysteine, γ-aminobutyric acid, histidine, hydroxylysine, 
hydroxyproline, glycine, proline, methionine, ornithine, tryptophan, aspartic 
acid, argininosuccinic acid, α-aminoadipic acid, and β-aminoisobutyric acid. RF 
algorithm defined a set of 15 metabolites that constitute the significant 
features of teratozoospermia. In particular, increased glutamine, asparagine, 
and decreased cysteine, tryptophan, glycine, and valine were strong predictors 
of teratozoospemia. The most affected metabolic pathways in teratozoospermic men 
are the aminoacyl-tRNA, arginine, valine-leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis. 
Altered metabolites detected in teratozoospermia were responsible for various 
roles in sperm functions that classified into four subgroups as follows: related 
metabolites to antioxidant function, energy production, sperm function, and 
spermatogenesis. The altered amino acid metabolome identified in this study may 
be related to the etiology of teratozoospermia, and may provide novel insight 
into potential biomarkers of male infertility for therapeutic targets.

De novo variants implicate chromatin modification, transcriptional regulation, 
and retinoic acid signaling in syndromic craniosynostosis.

Craniosynostosis (CS) is the most common congenital cranial anomaly. Several 
Mendelian forms of syndromic CS are well described, but a genetic etiology 
remains elusive in a substantial fraction of probands. Analysis of exome 
sequence data from 526 proband-parent trios with syndromic CS identified a 
marked excess (observed 98, expected 33, p = 4.83 × 10-20) of damaging de novo 
variants (DNVs) in genes highly intolerant to loss-of-function variation 
(probability of LoF intolerance > 0.9). 30 probands harbored damaging DNVs in 21 
genes that were not previously implicated in CS but are involved in chromatin 
modification and remodeling (4.7-fold enrichment, p = 1.1 × 10-11). 17 genes had 
multiple damaging DNVs, and 13 genes (CDK13, NFIX, ADNP, KMT5B, SON, ARID1B, 
CASK, CHD7, MED13L, PSMD12, POLR2A, CHD3, and SETBP1) surpassed thresholds for 
genome-wide significance. A recurrent gain-of-function DNV in the retinoic acid 
receptor alpha (RARA; c.865G>A [p.Gly289Arg]) was identified in two probands 
with similar CS phenotypes. CS risk genes overlap with those identified for 
autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders, are highly expressed in cranial 
neural crest cells, and converge in networks that regulate chromatin 
modification, gene transcription, and osteoblast differentiation. Our results 
identify several CS loci and have major implications for genetic testing and 
counseling.

Proteomic Profiling Reveals Cytotoxic Mechanisms of Action and Adaptive 
Mechanisms of Resistance in Porphyromonas gingivalis: Treatment with Juglans 
regia and Melaleuca alternifolia.

The increasing trend in the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria pushes 
research to discover new efficacious antibacterial agents from natural and 
synthetic sources. Porphyromonas gingivalis is a well-known bacterium commonly 
known for causing periodontal disease, and it is associated with the 
pathogenesis of life-changing systemic conditions such as Alzheimer's. Proteomic 
research can be utilized to test new antibacterial drugs and understand the 
adaptive resistive mechanisms of bacteria; hence, it is important in the drug 
discovery process. The current study focuses on identifying the antibacterial 
effects of Juglans regia (JR) and Melaleuca alternifolia (MA) on P. gingivalis 
and uses proteomics to identify modes of action while exploring its adaptive 
mechanisms. JR and MA extracts were tested for antibacterial efficacy using the 
agar well diffusion assay. A proteomic study was conducted identifying 
upregulated and downregulated proteins compared to control by 2D-DIGE analysis, 
and proteins were identified using MADLI-TOF/MS. The bacterial inhibition for JR 
was 20.14 ± 0.2, and that for MA was 19.72 ± 0.5 mm. Out of 88 differentially 
expressed proteins, there were 17 common differentially expressed proteins: 10 
were upregulated and 7 were downregulated in both treatments. Among the 
upregulated proteins were Arginine-tRNA ligase, ATP-dependent Clp protease 
proteolytic, and flavodoxins. In contrast, down-regulated proteins were ATP 
synthase subunit alpha and quinone, among others, which are known antibacterial 
targets. STRING analysis indicated a strong network of interactions between 
differentially expressed proteins, mainly involved in protein translation, 
post-translational modification, energy production, metabolic pathways, and 
protein repair and degradation. Both extracts were equi-efficacious at 
inhibiting P. gingivalis and displayed some overlapping proteomic profiles. 
However, the MR extract had a greater fold change in its profile than the JA 
extract. Downregulated proteins indicated similarity in the mode of action, and 
upregulated proteins appear to be related to adaptive mechanisms important in 
promoting repair, growth, survival, virulence, and resistance. Hence, both 
extracts may be useful in preventing P. gingivalis-associated conditions. 
Furthermore, our results may be helpful to researchers in identifying new 
antibiotics which may offset these mechanisms of resistance.

Aβ Chronic Exposure Promotes an Activation State of Microglia through 
Endocannabinoid Signalling Imbalance.

Dysfunctional phenotype of microglia, the primary brain immune cells, may 
aggravate Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis by releasing proinflammatory 
factors, such as nitric oxide (NO). The endocannabinoids 
N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) are bioactive 
lipids increasingly recognised for their essential roles in regulating 
microglial activity both under normal and AD-driven pathological conditions. To 
investigate the possible impact of chronic exposure to β-amyloid peptides (Aβ) 
on the microglial endocannabinoid signalling, we characterised the functional 
expression of the endocannabinoid system on neonatal microglia isolated from 
wild-type and Tg2576 mice, an AD-like model, which overexpresses Aβ peptides in 
the developing brain. We found that Aβ-exposed microglia produced 2-fold more 
2-AG than normal microglia. Accordingly, the expression levels of diacylglycerol 
lipase-α (DAGLα) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), the main enzymes 
responsible for synthesising and hydrolysing 2-AG, respectively, were 
consistently modified in Tg2576 microglia. Furthermore, compared to wild-type 
cells, transgenic microglia basally showed increased expression of the 
cannabinoid 2 receptor, typically upregulated in an activated proinflammatory 
phenotype. Indeed, following inflammatory stimulus, Aβ-exposed microglia 
displayed an enhanced production of NO, which was abolished by pharmacological 
inhibition of DAGLα. These findings suggested that exposure to Aβ polarises 
microglial cells towards a pro-AD phenotype, possibly by enhancing 2-AG 
signalling.

Designing antimicrobial peptides using deep learning and molecular dynamic 
simulations.

With the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria, antimicrobial peptides 
(AMPs) offer promising options for replacing traditional antibiotics to treat 
bacterial infections, but discovering and designing AMPs using traditional 
methods is a time-consuming and costly process. Deep learning has been applied 
to the de novo design of AMPs and address AMP classification with high 
efficiency. In this study, several natural language processing models were 
combined to design and identify AMPs, i.e. sequence generative adversarial nets, 
bidirectional encoder representations from transformers and multilayer 
perceptron. Then, six candidate AMPs were screened by AlphaFold2 structure 
prediction and molecular dynamic simulations. These peptides show low homology 
with known AMPs and belong to a novel class of AMPs. After initial bioactivity 
testing, one of the peptides, A-222, showed inhibition against gram-positive and 
gram-negative bacteria. The structural analysis of this novel peptide A-222 
obtained by nuclear magnetic resonance confirmed the presence of an alpha-helix, 
which was consistent with the results predicted by AlphaFold2. We then performed 
a structure-activity relationship study to design a new series of peptide 
analogs and found that the activities of these analogs could be increased by 
4-8-fold against Stenotrophomonas maltophilia WH 006 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
PAO1. Overall, deep learning shows great potential in accelerating the discovery 
of novel AMPs and holds promise as an important tool for developing novel AMPs.

The Influence of Exogenous Phenylalanine on the Accumulation of Secondary 
Metabolites in Agitated Shoot Cultures of Ruta graveolens L.

Szewczyk A(1), Paździora W(1), Ekiert H(1).

This study aimed to examine the influence of the addition of a precursor 
(phenylalanine) on the accumulation of secondary metabolites in agitated shoot 
cultures of Ruta graveolens. Cultures were grown on Linsmaier and Skoog (LS) 
medium, with plant growth regulators (0.1 mg/L α-naphthaleneacetic acid-NAA-and 
0.1 mg/L 6-benzylaminopurine-BAP). Phenylalanine was added to the cultures at a 
concentration of 1.25 g/L after 4 and 5 weeks of growth cycles. Biomass was 
collected after 2, 4, and 7 days of precursor addition. Both control and 
experimental cultures had the same secondary metabolites accumulated. Using the 
HPLC method, linear furanocoumarins (bergapten, isoimperatorin, isopimpinellin, 
psoralen, and xanthotoxin), furoquinoline alkaloids (γ-fagarine, 
7-isopentenyloxy-γ-fagarine, and skimmianine), and catechin were detected and 
quantified in the methanolic extracts. In turn, phenolic acids, such as gallic 
acid, protocatechuic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, syringic acid, p-coumaric 
acid, and ferulic acid were detected in hydrolysates. The production of phenolic 
acids and catechin (1.5-fold) was significantly increased by the addition of 
precursor, while there was no significant effect on the production of coumarins 
and alkaloids. The highest total content of phenolic acids (109 mg/100 g DW) was 
obtained on the second day of phenylalanine addition (the fourth week of growth 
cycles). The dominant phenolic compounds were p-coumaric acid (maximum content 
64.3 mg/100 g DW) and ferulic acid (maximum content 35.6 mg/100 g DW). In the 
case of catechins, the highest total content (66 mg/100 g DW) was obtained on 
the third day of precursor addition (the fourth week of growth cycles). This 
study is the first to document the effect of feeding the culture medium with 
phenylalanine on the accumulation of bioactive metabolites in in vitro cultures 
of R. graveolens.

CONTEXT: Atherosclerosis (AS) is the main cause of cardiovascular and 
cerebrovascular diseases. Pueraria lobata (Willd.) Ohwi (Fabaceae) has a 
positive effect on improving these diseases.
OBJECTIVE: The P. lobata effect on the proliferation and inflammation of 
vascular smooth muscle in AS and the potential mechanism were investigated.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: By feeding a high-fat diet to 8-week-old apolipoprotein E 
knockout mice, an atherosclerosis model was created. H&E and IHC staining were 
used to analyse the histopathology of mice. CCK-8, TUNEL, and scratch tests were 
used to detect cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration after 24 h 
treatment, respectively. ELISA was performed to evaluate the level of IL-6 and 
IL-8. The target miRNA and its downstream target gene were screened by the 
bioinformatics method; RT-qPCR has conducted to analyse the expression of these 
genes.
RESULTS: In the aortic tissue and serum of AS mice, puerarin can lower the 
expression of α-SMA and the inflammatory proteins IL-6 and IL-8. Puerarin 
(200 M) decreased hVSMC proliferation, migration, and IL-6 and IL-8 secretion by 
more than half. The inhibitory impact of puerarin on hVSMC was decreased by 
overexpression of miR-29b-3p. IGF1 was miR-29b-3p's downstream target gene. IGF1 
expression increased almost 3-fold in AS mice and hVSMC, but miR-29b-3p mimic 
inhibited it. The effect of miR-29b-3p on hVSMC was reversed when IGF1 was 
overexpressed.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Puerarin inhibits the proliferation and inflammation 
of vascular smooth muscle in AS through the miR-29b-3p/IGF1 pathway. Puerarin 
may have a beneficial effect in the treatment of atherosclerosis and offer a 
novel therapy option.

Formulation and characterization of liposomes containing drug absorption 
enhancers for optimized anti-HIV and antimalarial drug delivery.

Kheoane PS(1)(2), Enslin GM(1), Tarirai C(3).

Most of the current clinically used anti-HIV and antimalarial drugs have low 
bioavailability, either due to poor solubility and permeability, rapid clearance 
from anatomical reservoirs and poor retention at their site of action (e.g. due 
to the p-glycoprotein efflux system), and extreme first-pass metabolism (e.g. by 
the cytochrome P450 enzymes). Hence, new approaches such as the incorporation of 
drug absorption enhancers (DAEs) (also referred to as bioenhancers) into dosage 
forms, and exploration of nanocarriers such as liposomes as novel dosage forms, 
are needed and may provide a viable means that could improve the bioavailability 
of both anti-HIV and antimalarial drugs. Liposomes loaded with efavirenz or 
mefloquine in combination with drug absorption enhancers, as well as placebo 
dosage forms, were prepared using a thin-lipid film hydration technique and 
characterized for their particle size and zeta potentials, entrapment 
efficiency, in vitro drug release, and in vitro drug permeability. Liposomes 
were further investigated for their biocompatibility (safety) using H-4-II-E 
liver cells in vitro. Drug-loaded liposomes prepared using 
l-α-phospatidylcholine, dioleoyl (DOPC) and cholesterol (CHOL) (1:1 mol/mol) as 
well as liposomes made of 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC), 
CHOL, and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) 
(4:6:26 mol/mol/mol) exhibited the best results in terms of their entrapment 
efficiency, particle size, zeta potential, in vitro drug release, and 
permeability. DSPC:CHOL:DPPC liposomes released EFV-based formulations better 
than DPPC:CHOL liposomes for immediate release behaviour. DOPC:CHOL liposomes 
produced a controlled release and more drug was released in the presence of DAEs 
for both EFV (0.4-fold higher) and MQ-based (sevenfold higher) formulations in 
the first 2 h. However, these liposomes were less biocompatible (< 50% cell 
viability) with liver cells. DOPC:CHOL and DSPC:CHOL:DPPC liposomes could 
provide a useful nano-formulation platform, which could ensure drug loading, 
followed by sustained release of both anti-HIV and antimalaria drugs.

Treatment of bromate in UV/sulfite autoxidation process enhances formation of 
dibromoacetonitrile during chlorination.

Chen H(1), Lin T(2), Wang P(3), Zhang X(4), Jiang F(4), Liu W(1).

The integration of UV/sulfite autoxidation process (USAP, i.e., UV activation of 
sulfite in the presence of 5 ∼ 10 mg/L O2) into conventional water to degrade 
micropollutants rises extensive attention, but its impact on water quality, and 
especially the formation of disinfection byproducts is still unclear. Herein, 
the formation of dibromoacetonitrile (DBAN) from bromate (BrO3-) upon treatment 
with USAP followed by chlorination was evaluated, in the presence of amino acids 
(AAs) selected as representative organic matter in drinking water. Results 
revealed that hydrated electrons (eaq-) produced during USAP contribute to the 
reduction of BrO3- to Br-, which is then converted into HBrO/BrO- during 
post-chlorination. At the same time, sulfate radicals (SO4•-) and hydroxyl 
radicals (•OH) generated in USAP mediated AAs' conversion via α-hydrogen 
abstraction and NH2-hydrogen abstraction reactions to produce HN=C(CH3)‒COOH, 
CH3‒CH=NH, and CH3‒CN, which are released into the post-chlorination stage and 
therefore, enhance the bromine utilization factor (BUF) value and DBAN 
formation. The effects of the USAP treatment time, BrO3- concentration, AA 
concentration, pH, and real waters were also evaluated. Although 63.5% of BrO3- 
was eliminated by USAP followed by chlorination, the toxicity index (TI) was 
increased by 1.5-fold due to the formation of the all brominated CX3R-type 
nitrogenous disinfection byproducts (N-DBPs), demonstrating the potential risk 
of applying USAP as a treatment process in BrO3- containing waters.

Darrah E(3).

The negative relationship between schizophrenia (SCZ) and rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA) has been observed for 85 years, but the mechanisms driving this association 
are unknown. This study analyzed differences in profiles of cytokines (IL-1β, 
IL-Ra, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IFNγ, TNFα), selected genes 
(HLA-DRB1, IL1RN, HP2), and antibodies related to gluten sensitivity (AGA-IgG, 
AGA-IgA), celiac disease (tTG), and systemic autoimmunity (ANA, anti-CCP, RF) in 
40 subjects with SCZ, 40 with RA, and 40 healthy controls (HC). HLA-DRB1*04:01 
alleles were enriched in persons with SCZ and RA compared with HC, and the 
HP2/HP2 genotype was 2-fold more prevalent in AGA/tTG-positive versus negative 
SCZ patients. Patients with SCZ demonstrated 52.5% positivity for any of the 
antibodies tested, compared to 90% of RA patients and 30% of HC. Cluster 
analysis of the cytokines revealed three clusters: one associated with SCZ 
marked by high levels of IL-1Ra, one associated with HC, and one associated with 
both SCZ and RA marked by elevated levels of IFNγ, TNFα, and IL-6. These 
analyses suggest that stratification of SCZ patients by cytokine profile may 
identify unique SCZ subgroups and enable the use of currently available 
cytokine-targeted treatment strategies.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative 
agent of the COVID-19 global pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped RNA virus that 
relies on its trimeric surface glycoprotein spike for entry into host cells. 
Here we describe the COVID-19 vaccine candidate MV-014-212, a live, attenuated, 
recombinant human respiratory syncytial virus expressing a chimeric SARS-CoV-2 
spike as the only viral envelope protein. MV-014-212 was attenuated and 
immunogenic in African green monkeys (AGMs). One mucosal administration of 
MV-014-212 in AGMs protected against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, reducing by more than 
200-fold the peak shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in the nose. MV-014-212 elicited 
mucosal immunoglobulin A in the nose and neutralizing antibodies in serum that 
exhibited cross-neutralization against virus variants of concern Alpha, Beta, 
and Delta. Intranasally delivered, live attenuated vaccines such as MV-014-212 
entail low-cost manufacturing suitable for global deployment. MV-014-212 is 
currently in Phase 1 clinical trials as an intranasal COVID-19 vaccine.

Proteasome activator 28γ (PA28γ) allosterically activates trypsin-like 
proteolysis by binding to the α-ring of the 20S proteasome.

Thomas TA(1), Smith DM(2).

Proteasome activator 28γ (PA28γ/REGγ) is a member of the 11S family of 
proteasomal regulators that is constitutively expressed in the nucleus and 
implicated in various diseases, including certain cancers and systemic lupus 
erythematosus. Despite years of investigation, how PA28γ functions to stimulate 
proteasomal protein degradation remains unclear. Alternative hypotheses have 
been proposed for the molecular mechanism of PA28γ, including the following: (1) 
substrate selection, (2) allosteric upregulation of the trypsin-like (T-L) site, 
(3) allosteric inhibition of the chymotrypsin-like (CT-L) and caspase-like (C-L) 
sites, (4) conversion of the CT-L or C-L sites to new T-L sites, and (5) gate 
opening alone or in combination with a previous hypothesis. Here, by 
mechanistically decoupling gating effects from active site effects, we 
unambiguously demonstrate that WT PA28γ allosterically activates the T-L site. 
We show PA28γ binding increases the Kcat/Km by 13-fold for T-L peptide 
substrates while having little-to-no effect on hydrolysis kinetics for CT-L or 
C-L substrates. Furthermore, mutagenesis and domain swaps of PA28γ reveal that 
it does not select for T-L peptide substrates through either the substrate entry 
pore or the distal intrinsically disordered region. We also show that a 
previously reported point mutation can functionally switch PA28γ from a T-L 
activating to a gate-opening activator in a mutually exclusive fashion. Finally, 
using cryogenic electron microscopy, we visualized the PA28γ-proteasome complex 
at 4.3 Å and confirmed its expected quaternary structure. The results of this 
study provide unambiguous evidence that PA28γ can function by binding the 20S 
proteasome to allosterically activate the T-L proteolytic site.

MD-2.

Acute lung injury (ALI) is an inflammation-mediated respiratory disease that is 
associated with a high mortality rate. In this study, a series of novel 
O-benzylcinnamic acid derivatives were designed and synthesized using cinnamic 
acid as the lead compound. We tested the preliminary anti-inflammatory activity 
of the compounds by evaluating their effect on inhibiting the activity of 
alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in Hek-Blue-TLR4 cells, in which compound L26 showed 
the best activity and 7-fold more active than CIN. ELISA, immunoprecipitation, 
and molecular docking indicated that L26 targeted MD-2 protein and competed with 
LPS to bind to MD-2, which resulted in the inhibition of inflammation. In the 
LPS-induced mouse model of ALI, L26 was found to decrease ALP activity and 
inflammatory cytokine TNF-α release to reduce lung injury by inhibiting the 
NF-κB signaling pathway. Acute toxicity experiments showed that high doses of 
L26 did not cause adverse reactions in mice, and it was safe in vivo. Also, the 
preliminary pharmacokinetic parameters of L26 were investigated in SD rats 
(T1/2 = 4.246 h). In summary, L26 exhibited optimal pharmacodynamic and 
pharmacokinetic characteristics, which suggested that L26 could serve as a 
potential agent for the development of ALI treatment.

An Alternative Device for the Topical Treatment of Oral Cancer: Development and 
Ex-Vivo Evaluation of Imiquimod-Loaded Polysaccharides Formulations.

Pescina S(2), Santi P(2), Padula C(2), Moraes ÂM(1), Nicoli S(2).

The topical use of imiquimod (IMQ), a non-specific immune response modifier, 
showed to be a promising therapeutic option for the early-stage treatment of 
some type of oral cancer, even when performed with a formulation (Aldara®) 
developed and approved for skin application. The aim of this work was the 
development of buccal formulations for the topical administration of IMQ with 
improved mucosal retention and reduced trans-mucosal permeation when compared to 
the reference formulation. Three different hydrogels based on carboxymethyl 
chitosan (CMChit), sodium alginate (A), and xanthan gum (X) in different 
combinations were prepared, and the loading of imiquimod was successfully 
performed by using a micellar formulation based on d-α-tocopheril polyethylene 
glycol 100 succinate (TPGS). Except for CMChit formulation, in all the other 
cases, the performance in vitro on the mucosa resulted comparable to the 
commercial formulation, despite the drug loading being 50-fold lower. Converting 
the gels in films did not modify the IMQ accumulated with respect to the 
correspondent gel formulation but produced as a positive effect a significant 
reduction in the amount permeated. Compared to the commercial formulation, this 
reduction was significant (p < 0.01) in the case of X film, resulting in an 
improvement of the retained/permeated ratio from 1 to 5.44. Mucoadhesion 
evaluation showed similar behavior when comparing the developed gels and the 
commercial formulation, and an excellent bioadhesion was observed for the films.

Antimicrobial Activity and Immunomodulatory Properties of Acidocin A, the 
Pediocin-like Bacteriocin with the Non-Canonical Structure.

EV(1), Toropygin IY(2), Finkina EI(1), Ovchinnikova TV(1)(3)(4).

Pediocin-like bacteriocins are among the natural antimicrobial agents attracting 
attention as scaffolds for the development of a new generation of antibiotics. 
Acidocin A has significant structural differences from most other members of 
this subclass. We studied its antibacterial and cytotoxic activity, as well as 
effects on the permeability of E. coli membranes in comparison with avicin A, 
the typical pediocin-like bacteriocin. Acidocin A had a more marked tendency to 
form an alpha-helical structure upon contact with detergent micelles, as was 
shown by CD spectroscopy, and demonstrated considerably less specific mode of 
action: it inhibited growth of Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains, which 
were unsusceptible to avicin A, and disrupted the integrity of outer and inner 
membranes of E. coli. However, the peptide retained a low toxicity towards 
normal and tumor human cells. The effect of mutations in the pediocin box of 
acidocin A (on average, a 2-4-fold decrease in activity) was less pronounced 
than is usually observed for such peptides. Using multiplex analysis, we showed 
that acidocin A and avicin A modulated the expression level of a number of 
cytokines and growth factors in primary human monocytes. Acidocin A induced the 
production of a number of inflammatory mediators (IL-6, TNFα, MIG/CXCL9, 
MCP-1/CCL2, MCP-3/CCL7, and MIP-1β) and inhibited the production of some 
anti-inflammatory factors (IL-1RA, MDC/CCL22). We assumed that the activity of 
acidocin A and similar peptides produced by lactic acid bacteria might affect 
the functional state of the human intestinal tract, not only through direct 
inhibition of various groups of symbiotic and pathogenic bacteria, but also via 
immunomodulatory effects.

Triggering of lymphocytes by CD28, 4-1BB, and PD-1 checkpoints to enhance the 
immune response capacities.

Kaviani E(1)(2), Hosseini A(2), Mahmoudi Maymand E(2), Ramzi M(3), Ghaderi A(2), 
Ramezani A(1)(2).

Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) usually become exhausted and dysfunctional 
owing to chronic contact with tumor cells and overexpression of multiple 
inhibitor receptors. Activation of TILs by targeting the inhibitory and 
stimulatory checkpoints has emerged as one of the most promising immunotherapy 
prospectively. We investigated whether triggering of CD28, 4-1BB, and PD-1 
checkpoints simultaneously or alone could enhance the immune response capacity 
of lymphocytes. In this regard, anti-PD-1, CD80-Fc, and 4-1BBL-Fc proteins were 
designed and produced in CHO-K1 cells as an expression host. Following 
confirmation of the Fc fusion proteins' ability to bind to native targets 
expressed on engineered CHO-K1 cells (CHO-K1/hPD-1, CHO-K1/hCD28, CHO-K1/hCTLA4, 
and CHO-K1/h4-1BB), the effects of each protein, on its own and in various 
combinations, were assessed in vitro on T cell proliferation, cytotoxicity, and 
cytokines secretion using the Mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) assay, 7-AAD/CFSE 
cell-mediated cytotoxicity assay, and a LEGENDplex™ Human Th Cytokine Panel, 
respectively. MLR results demonstrated that T cell proliferation in the presence 
of the combinations of anti-PD-1/CD80-Fc, CD80-Fc/4-1BBL-Fc, and 
anti-PD-1/CD80-Fc/4-1BBL-Fc proteins was significantly higher than in the 
untreated condition (1.83-, 1.91-, and 2.02-fold respectively). Furthermore, 
anti-PD-1 (17%), 4-1BBL-Fc (19.2%), anti-PD-1/CD80-Fc (18.6%), 
anti-PD-1/4-1BBL-Fc (21%), CD80-Fc/4-1BBL-Fc (18.5%), and 
anti-PD-1/CD80-Fc/4-1BBL-Fc (17.3%) significantly enhanced cytotoxicity activity 
compared to untreated condition (7.8%). However, concerning the cytokine 
production, CD80-Fc and 4-1BBL-Fc alone or in combination significantly 
increased the secretion of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2 compared with the untreated 
conditions. In conclusion, this research establishes that the various 
combinations of produced anti-PD-1, CD80-Fc, and 4-1BBL-Fc proteins can 
noticeably induce the immune response in vitro. Each of these combinations may 
be effective in killing or destroying cancer cells depending on the type and 
stage of cancer.

Update of
    bioRxiv. 2022 Jan 25;:

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing 
COVID-19, has continued to mutate and spread worldwide despite global 
vaccination efforts. In particular, the Omicron variant, first identified in 
South Africa in late November 2021, has become the dominant strain worldwide. 
Compared to the original strain identified in Wuhan, Omicron features 50 genetic 
mutations, with 15 mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike 
protein, which binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 
receptor for viral entry. However, it is not completely understood how these 
mutations alter the interaction and binding strength between the Omicron RBD and 
ACE2. In this study, we used a combined steered molecular dynamics (SMD) 
simulation and experimental microscale thermophoresis (MST) approach to quantify 
the interaction between Omicron RBD and ACE2. We report that the Omicron brings 
an enhanced RBD-ACE2 interface through N501Y, Q498R, and T478K mutations; the 
changes further lead to unique interaction patterns, reminiscing the features of 
previously dominated variants, Alpha (N501Y) and Delta (L452R and T478K). Among 
the Q493K and Q493R, we report that Q493R shows stronger binding to ACE2 than 
Q493K due to increased interactions. Our MST data confirmed that the Omicron 
mutations in RBD are associated with a five-fold higher binding affinity to ACE2 
compared to the RBD of the original strain. In conclusion, our results could 
help explain the Omicron variant's prevalence in human populations, as higher 
interaction forces or affinity for ACE2 likely promote greater viral binding and 
internalization, leading to increased infectivity.

Difference in Intestinal Flora and Characteristics of Plasma Metabonomics in 
Pneumoconiosis Patients.

Y(1), Li J(1), Li X(1), Xia Q(3), Shen F(1).

From the two perspectives of intestinal flora and plasma metabolomics, the 
mechanism of occurrence and development of pneumoconiosis was explored to 
provide a new target for the prevention and treatment of pneumoconiosis. In this 
study, 16S ribosome DNA (16SrDNA) gene sequencing technology was used to analyze 
the differences in intestinal flora of each research group through operational 
taxonomic units (OUT) analysis, cluster analysis, principal component analysis 
(PCA), partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), Kyoto Encyclopedia 
of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and other analytical methods were used to analyze 
the differences in plasma metabolites between the study groups. Metabonomics 
analysis showed that the plasma metabolites of pneumoconiosis patients were 
significantly different from those of normal people. Fold change > 2; vip > 1; p 
< 0.05 were the screening criteria. In the positive and negative mode, we 
screened ten types of differential metabolites. These ten metabolites were 
upregulated to varying degrees in the pneumoconiosis patients. Seven metabolic 
pathways were obtained by analyzing the metabolic pathways of different 
metabolites. Among them, the aminoacyl tRNA biosynthesis pathway changed most 
obviously. The α diversity of two groups of intestinal flora was analyzed using 
the 16SrDNA technique. The results showed that there was no significant 
difference in ACE, Chao1, Shannon, or Simpson in the two groups (p > 0.05). Beta 
diversity analysis showed that there were differences in microbial communities. 
In pneumoconiosis patients, the abundance of Prevotellaceae increased, and the 
other nine species decreased. Compared to the control group, the abundance of 
Prevotellaceae in the intestinal flora of pneumoconiosis increased, and the 
abundance of the other nine species decreased. Compared to controls, ten 
substances in the plasma metabolites of pneumoconiosis patients were 
upregulated. Seven metabolic pathways were obtained by analyzing the metabolic 
pathways of different metabolites. Among them, the aminoacyl tRNA biosynthesis 
pathway changed most significantly. This provided a theoretical basis for 
further study on the pathogenesis, early prevention, and treatment of 
pneumoconiosis.

Tied up in knots: Untangling substrate recognition by the SPOUT 
methyltransferases.

Strassler SE(1), Bowles IE(2), Dey D(3), Jackman JE(4), Conn GL(5).

The SpoU-TrmD (SPOUT) methyltransferase superfamily was designated when 
structural similarity was identified between the transfer RNA-modifying enzymes 
TrmH (SpoU) and TrmD. SPOUT methyltransferases are found in all domains of life 
and predominantly modify transfer RNA or ribosomal RNA substrates, though one 
instance of an enzyme with a protein substrate has been reported. Modifications 
placed by SPOUT methyltransferases play diverse roles in regulating cellular 
processes such as ensuring translational fidelity, altering RNA stability, and 
conferring bacterial resistance to antibiotics. This large collection of 
S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferases is defined by a unique α/β 
fold with a deep trefoil knot in their catalytic (SPOUT) domain. Herein, we 
describe current knowledge of SPOUT enzyme structure, domain architecture, and 
key elements of catalytic function, including S-adenosyl-L-methionine 
co-substrate binding, beginning with a new sequence alignment that divides the 
SPOUT methyltransferase superfamily into four major clades. Finally, a major 
focus of this review will be on our growing understanding of how these diverse 
enzymes accomplish the molecular feat of specific substrate recognition and 
modification, as highlighted by recent advances in our knowledge of protein-RNA 
complex structures and the discovery of the dependence of one SPOUT 
methyltransferase on metal ion binding for catalysis. Considering the broad 
biological roles of RNA modifications, developing a deeper understanding of the 
process of substrate recognition by the SPOUT enzymes will be critical for 
defining many facets of fundamental RNA biology with implications for human 
disease.

Bullous pemphigoid anti-BP180-NC16A autoantibody reactivity in healthy 
individuals is associated with marked hypovitaminosis D and Th2-like cytokine 
predominance.

Autoimmune bullous disease autoantibodies, particularly including bullous 
pemphigoid (BP)-related anti-BP180-NC16A IgG, have been reported in a small 
subset of healthy individuals, but information about associated factors is 
lacking. We hypothesized that an abnormal status of immunomodulatory vitamin D 
could play a role in anti-BP180-NC16A autoantibody reactivity in healthy 
persons. In addition, we aimed to evaluate the cytokine profile associated with 
these autoantibodies. Plasma samples from 34 anti-BP180-NC16A IgG-reactive and 
85 anti-BP180-NC16A IgG-negative healthy blood donors were tested for levels of 
25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and a wide range of cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, 
IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-22, IFN-γ, and TNF-α). We 
observed that anti-BP180-NC16A IgG-reactive healthy subjects had significantly 
lower plasma 25(OH)D levels and about a two-fold higher rate of vitamin D 
deficiency (< 20 ng/ml) compared to anti-BP180-NC16A IgG-negative healthy 
persons. In addition, anti-BP180-NC16A IgG-positive samples were characterized 
by significantly higher levels of IL-2, IL-5, IL-9, IL-10, and IL-13 which were, 
however, not significantly associated with the vitamin D levels. Our results 
indicate that healthy individuals with BP autoantibody reactivity share 
similarities with BP patients regarding the vitamin D status and cytokine 
profile (i.e., marked hypovitaminosis D and Th2 predominance), which may have 
pathophysiologic implications.

Unfolding the Potency of Adenosine in Targeting Triple Negative Breast Cancer 
via Paclitaxel-Incorporated pH-Responsive Stealth Liposomes.

Jain S(1).

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) belongs to the category of the most 
destructive forms of breast cancer. Being a highly potent chemotherapeutic 
agent, paclitaxel (PTX) is extensively utilized in the management of various 
cancers. Commercially available PTX formulations contain non-targeted drug 
carriers that result in low antitumor activity because of non-specific tissue 
distribution. Thus, to resolve this issue, we designed PTX-loaded pH-sensitive 
liposomes (pH Lipos) in the present investigation and used adenosine (ADN) as a 
targeting ligand. Further, d-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS) 
was incorporated into the liposomes to impart a stealth effect to the system. 
For the development of these pH Lipos, different conjugates were synthesized 
(ADN-CHEMS and TPGS-ADN) and further utilized for the preparation of ADN-PEG-pH 
Lipo and ADN-pH Lipo by a thin-film hydration method. 
DOPE:HSPC:CHEMS:cholesterol at a molar ratio of 3:3:2:2 was selected for the 
preparation of pH-Lipo possessing 7.5% w/w drug loading. They showed a particle 
size below 140 nm, a PDI below 0.205, and a % EE greater than 60%. All of the pH 
Lipos displayed a biphasic pattern of PTX release at pH 7.4 and 5.5. However, 
the percent drug release at pH 5.5 was substantially greater because of the 
pH-sensitive nature of the liposomes. The MDA MB 231 and 4T1 cell lines depicted 
improvement in the qualitative as well as quantitative cellular uptake of PTX 
ADN-PEG-pH Lipo with a substantial decrease in the IC50 value. Moreover, a 
higher apoptotic index was observed with pH Lipo compared to free PTX. PTX 
ADN-PEG-pH Lipo revealed a 3.98- and 3.41-fold rise in the AUC and t1/2 values 
of PTX compared to Intaxel, respectively. Overall, characteristic decreases in 
tumor volume and serum toxicity marker levels were observed, which confirmed the 
development of an efficient and safe formulation.

Truncated analog Brevinin2-CE-N26V5K: Revelation the Augmentation of 
Antimicrobial Activity.

Zhao Y(1), Wang XY(1), Sun Y(2), Li Z(3), Liu T(1), Liu QM(1), Chen J(1).

Brevinin2-CE (B2CE), a natural peptide containing 37 amino acids, was first 
isolated from the skin secretions of the Chinese forest frog Rana chensinensis. 
B2CE shows good antibacterial activity. In this study, a series of B2CE analogs 
with differences in cationicity, α-helicity, hydrophobicity and amphipathic 
properties were designed through chain-length deletion and amino acid 
substitution. The most potent, nontoxic analog, B2CE-N26V5K, was identified by 
examination of its antibacterial activity, hemolytic activity, and stability 
under physiological conditions. The increased cationicity, hydrophobicity and 
more obvious hydrophilic and hydrophobic surface of B2CE-N26-N16WA18KG23K did 
not improve the antibacterial activity but increased the hemolytic activity of 
this modified peptide. The helicity might promote antibacterial activity for 
brevinin-2 peptides, as the 15-aa analogs with lower helicity show decreased 
potency against different test bacteria (approximately 2- to 72-fold) compared 
to B2CE-N26V5K. Additionally, the results indicated that the "Rana box" does not 
affect the antimicrobial activity of brevinin-2 peptides, as B2CE, B2CE-nonDS 
and B2CE-C31-37 S have similar strong inhibitory effects on both gram-positive 
and gram-negative bacteria. However, the "Rana box" does affect the hemolytic 
activity, as the HC50 values of the 3 peptides range from 25 ~ 130 µM. 
Furthermore, B2CE-N26V5K caused obvious morphological alterations of the 
bacterial surfaces, as shown by atomic force microscopy. Additionally, 
B2CE-N26V5K exhibited strong membrane-disrupting activity when examined using 
the LIVE/DEAD Bac Light Bacterial Viability Kit. Thus, the antibacterial effect 
of B2CE-N26V5K on gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria may be caused by cell 
membrane attack. In conclusion, the excellent candidate B2CE-N26V5K was obtained 
and has application prospects as a novel anti-infective agent.

BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Distinct hepatitis relapse has been observed after 
discontinuing entecavir (ETV) or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) therapy in 
chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. End-of-therapy (EOT) serum cytokines were 
compared and used for outcome prediction.
METHODS: A total of 80 non-cirrhotic CHB patients in a tertiary medical center 
in Taiwan who discontinued ETV (n = 51) or TDF (n = 29) therapy after fulfilling 
the APASL guidelines were prospectively enrolled. Serum cytokines were measured 
at EOT and 3rd month afterwards. Multivariable analysis was performed to predict 
virological relapse (VR, HBV DNA >2000 IU/mL), clinical relapse (CR, VR and 
alanine aminotransferase > 2-fold upper limit of normal) and hepatitis B surface 
antigen (HBsAg) seroclearance.
RESULTS: Compared with TDF group, ETV stoppers had greater interleukin 5 (IL-5), 
IL-12 p70, IL-13, IL-17 A and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) (all 
P < 0.05) at EOT. Older age, TDF use, higher EOT HBsAg and IL-18 (Hazard ratio 
[HR], 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00-1.02) levels at EOT predicted VR, while older age, 
higher EOT HBsAg and IL-7 (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.00-1.56) levels predicted CR. In 
TDF stoppers, higher IL-7 (HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.05-1.60) and IL-18 (HR, 1.02; 95% 
CI, 1.00-1.04) levels predicted VR, while IL-7 (HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.08-1.65) and 
interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02-1.14) levels predicted CR. 
A lower EOT HBsAg level was associated with HBsAg seroclearance.
CONCLUSION: Distinct cytokine profiles were observed after stopping ETV or TDF. 
Higher EOT IL-7, IL-18, and IFN-gamma could be probable predictors for VR and CR 
in patients discontinuing NA therapies.

M(1), Schibli R(3), Ametamey SM(3), Klohs J(1), Mu L(4)(5).

PURPOSE: Stroke is one of the most prevalent vascular diseases. Non-invasive 
molecular imaging methods have the potential to provide critical insights into 
the temporal dynamics and follow alterations of receptor expression and 
metabolism in ischemic stroke. The aim of this study was to assess the 
cannabinoid type 2 receptor (CB2R) levels in transient middle cerebral artery 
occlusion (tMCAO) mouse models at subacute stage using positron emission 
tomography (PET) with our novel tracer [18F]RoSMA-18-d6 and structural imaging 
by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
PROCEDURES: Our recently developed CB2R PET tracer [18F]RoSMA-18-d6 was used for 
imaging neuroinflammation at 24 h after reperfusion in tMCAO mice. The RNA 
expression levels of CB2R and other inflammatory markers were analyzed by 
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction using brain tissues from tMCAO 
(1 h occlusion) and sham-operated mice. [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) was 
included for evaluation of the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRglc). In 
addition, diffusion-weighted imaging and T2-weighted imaging were performed for 
anatomical reference and delineating the lesion in tMCAO mice.
RESULTS: mRNA expressions of inflammatory markers TNF-α, Iba1, MMP9 and GFAP, 
CNR2 were increased to 1.3-2.5 fold at 24 h after reperfusion in the ipsilateral 
compared to contralateral hemisphere of tMCAO mice, while mRNA expression of the 
neuronal marker MAP-2 was markedly reduced to ca. 50 %. Reduced [18F]FDG uptake 
was observed in the ischemic striatum of tMCAO mouse brain at 24 h after 
reperfusion. Although higher activity of [18F]RoSMA-18-d6 in ex vivo 
biodistribution studies and higher standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) were 
detected in the ischemic ipsilateral compared to contralateral striatum in tMCAO 
mice, the in vivo specificity of [18F]RoSMA-18-d6 was confirmed only in the 
CB2R-rich spleen.
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed an increased [18F]RoSMA-18-d6 measure of CB2R 
and a reduced [18F]FDG measure of CMRglc in the ischemic striatum of tMCAO mice 
at subacute stage. [18F]RoSMA-18-d6 might be a promising PET tracer for 
detecting CB2R alterations in animal models of neuroinflammation without 
neuronal loss.

expression in arterial atherogenesis using [(64)Cu]Cu-DOTA-AE105 positron 
emission tomography (PET).

Comment in
    Atherosclerosis. 2022 Jul;352:80-82.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) is 
associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation and cancer 
aggressiveness. Its role in arterial atherogenesis as a molecular imaging target 
is not well-established. The aim of this study was to non-invasively visualize 
uPAR expression in atherosclerosis by a novel uPAR-targeting positron emission 
tomography (PET) tracer [64Cu]Cu-DOTA-AE105.
METHODS: We used molecular biology to investigate uPAR expression by analyzing 
human atherosclerotic plaques and cultured cells. A retrospective analysis was 
performed on patients, who underwent combined PET/CT (n = 10) to measure 
[64Cu]Cu-DOTA-AE105 uptake in five large arteries, divided into a high and 
low-risk group based on coronary artery calcium score (CAC score).
RESULTS: The in vitro assay for THP-1 monocytes displayed a significantly 
upregulated uPAR expression upon stimulation (5.2-fold upregulation, p < 0.0001 
by a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test) by single-cell flowcytometric 
analysis. Freshly excised human atherosclerotic plaques underwent flow 
cytometric and microarray analyses manifesting 73.9 ± 2.9% of mononuclear 
phagocyte system (MPS) cells expressing uPAR and had a greater than 7-fold 
higher gene expression of plasminogen activator urokinase receptor (PLAUR, 
p = 0.002), integrin subunit alpha X (ITGAX, p = 0.0008), and cluster of 
differentiation 163 (CD163, p < 0.0001). The tissue-to-background ratios 
(TBRmax) in five large arteries showed a higher [64Cu]Cu-DOTA-AE105 uptake in 
the group with high CAC score compared to the group with low CAC score 
(2.4 ± 0.1 vs 1.7 ± 0.1, p = 0.057), significantly higher in the ascending aorta 
(2.7 ± 0.1 vs 2.0 ± 0.1, p = 0.038) and the abdominal aorta (3.2 ± 0.2 vs 
2.0 ± 0.2, p = 0.038) by a non-parametric Mann-Whitney test.
CONCLUSIONS: uPAR is abundantly expressed by MPS cells in atherosclerotic 
plaques and can be visualized by the novel PET tracer [64Cu]Cu-DOTA-AE105 that 
may non-invasively detect extracellular matrix remodeling during atherogenesis.

Time-resolved proteome and transcriptome of paraquat-induced pulmonary fibrosis.

Fan L(1), Li Y(2), Zhang X(3), Wu Y(4), Song Y(5), Zhang F(6), Zhang J(7), Sun 
H(8).

BACKGROUNDS: Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a pathological state presenting at the 
progressive stage of heterogeneous interstitial lung disease (ILD). The current 
understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved is incomplete. This clinical 
toxicology study focused on the pulmonary fibrosis induced by paraquat (PQ), a 
widely-used herbicide. Using proteo-transcriptome analysis, we identified 
differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) derived from the initial development of 
fibrosis to the dissolved stage and provided further functional analysis.
METHODS: We established a mouse model of progressive lung fibrosis via 
intratracheal instillation of paraquat. To acquire a comprehensive and unbiased 
understanding of the onset of pulmonary fibrosis, we performed time-series 
proteomics profiling (iTRAQ) and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) on lung samples from 
paraquat-treated mice and saline control. The biological functions and pathways 
involved were evaluated through Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of 
Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Pathway analysis. Correlation tests were conducted on 
comparable groups 7 days and 28 days post-exposure. Differentially expressed 
proteins and genes following the same trend on the protein and mRNA levels were 
selected for validation. The functions of the selected molecules were identified 
in vitro. The protein level was overexpressed by transfecting gene-containing 
plasmid or suppressed by transfecting specific siRNA in A549 cells. The levels 
of endothlial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, including E-cadherin, 
vimentin, FN1, and α-SMA, were determined via western blot to evaluate the 
fibrotic process.
RESULTS: We quantified 1358 DEPs on day 7 and 426 DEPs on day 28 post exposure 
(Fold change &gt;1.2; Q value &lt; 0.05). The top 5 pathways - drug 
metabolism-cytochrome P450, metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, 
complement and coagulation cascades, chemical carcinogenesis, protein digestion 
and absorption - were involved on both day 7 and day 28. Several pathways, 
including tight junction, focal adhesion, platelet activation, and ECM-receptor 
interaction, were more enriched on day 28 than on day 7. Integrative analysis of 
the proteome and transcriptome revealed a moderate correlation of quantitative 
protein abundance ratios with RNA abundance ratios (Spearman R = 0.3950 and 
0.2477 on days 7 and 28, respectively), indicating that post-transcriptional 
regulation plays an important role in lung injury and repair. Western blot 
identified that the protein expressions of FN1, S100A4, and RBM3 were 
significantly upregulated while that of CYP1A1, FMO3, and PGDH were 
significantly downregulated on day 7. All proteins generally recovered to 
baseline on day 28. qPCR showed the mRNA levels of Fn1, S100a4, Rbm3, Cyp1a1, 
Fmo3, and Hpgd changed following the same trend as the levels of their 
respective proteins. Further, in vitro experiments showed that RBM3 was 
upregulated while PGDH was downregulated in an EMT model established in human 
lung epithelial A549 cells. RBM3 overexpression and PGDH knockout could both 
induce EMT in A549 cells. RBM3 knockout or PGDH overexpression had no reverse 
effect on EMT in A549 cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our proteo-transcriptomic study determined the proteins responsible 
for fibrogenesis and uncovers their dynamic regulation from lung injury to 
repair, providing new insights for the development of biomarkers for diagnosis 
and treatment of fibrotic diseases.

Anti-inflammatory and anti-pruritic effects of Chi-Huang Solution in a murine 
model of allergic contact dermatitis.

Yang H(1), Ming Y(1), Wang W(1), Jin Y(1), Hao Z(2), Liu G(1), Zhang D(3), Lin 
J(4).

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: In treating atopic dermatitis, multi-mode 
management is adopted, including trying to avoid the allergens, controlling and 
preventing secondary infections, and using drugs to control itching. At present, 
most of the commonly used anti-pruritic drugs in the clinic are single-target 
and lead to serious side effects. Many studies have shown that a variety of 
traditional Chinese medicines have significant anti-inflammatory and 
anti-pruritic effects, and have the characteristics of multiple components, 
multiple targets, and multiple effects.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The study aimed to explore the anti-inflammatory and 
anti-pruritic effects of the Chi-Huang Solution in a murine model of Allergic 
contact dermatitis (ACD). This study considers the effectiveness of the 
Chi-Huang Solution for external use on skin to provide an experimental basis for 
the clinical development and application of Chinese medicine and related 
preparations for Canine atopic dermatitis (CAD).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two male SPF C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided 
into control group (n = 6), ACD model group (n = 6), HAC control group (n = 6), 
and 4 Chi-Huang Solution groups (n = 6 in each group). With SADBE induce the 
murine model of ACD chronic pruritus, and initially evaluate whether the model 
is successful by counting scratching behavior, measuring the skin fold thickness 
and skin lesion score within 1 h. After treating the ACD model mice with 
deionized water, HAC, 1CH, 2CH, 3CH, and 4CH for 7 days, behavioral changes were 
used to evaluate the anti-pruritic effect. The skin fold thickness, skin lesion 
score, and spleen index were used to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of 
the Chi-Huang Solution. H.E. staining was used for the epidermal thickness 
measurement and pathological evaluation. RT-qPCR was used to analyze the mRNA 
expression of related inflammatory factors such as IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-33, IL-4, 
IL-17A, CXCL10, and its receptor CXCR3 in the skin of the lesion site, as well 
as to detect the mRNA expression of pruritus-related genes such as TRPV1, TRPA1, 
and GRP in DRG.
RESULTS: After the treatment of low-dose (0.1 g/mL) and medium-dose (0.2 g/mL) 
Chi-Huang Solution, the scratching times both decreased significantly 
(P < 0.05), meanwhile the medium-dose Chi-Huang Solution had an obvious effect 
on reducing scratches/scab score (P < 0.05). Moreover, no matter what dose it 
takes, all Chi-Huang Solution can alleviate the epidermal thickening (P < 0.05) 
and the infiltration of mast cells in the ACD murine model of ACD. It is worth 
mentioning that the count of mast cells in the dermis was significantly 
down-regulated after the treatment of medium-dose Chi-Huang Solution 
(P < 0.005). Furthermore, Chi-Huang Solution can significantly down-regulate the 
mRNA expression of related inflammatory factors in the skin, and reduce the mRNA 
expression of pruritus-related genes, such as TRPA1, TRPV1, and GRP in the 
spinal cord.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that Chi-Huang Solution for external use 
exhibits significant anti-inflammatory and anti-pruritic effects on 
SADBE-induced ACD chronic pruritus murine models. Chi-Huang Solution might 
emerge as an effective drug for the treatment of CAD and high-dose Chi-Huang 
Solution (0.4 g/ml) has better comprehensive effects.

Alpha-Ketoglutarate or 5-HMF: Single Compounds Effectively Eliminate Leukemia 
Cells via Caspase-3 Apoptosis and Antioxidative Pathways.

Greilberger J(1)(2), Herwig R(3)(4), Kacar M(5)(6), Brajshori N(4), Feigl G(7), 
Stiegler P(8), Wintersteiger R(9).

BACKGROUND: We recently showed that a combined solution containing 
alpha-ketoglutarate (aKG) and 5-hydroxymethyl-furfural (5-HMF) has a solid 
antitumoral effect on the Jurkat cell line due to the fact of its antioxidative, 
caspase-3 and apoptosis activities, but no negative effect on human fibroblasts 
was obtained. The question arises how the single compounds, aKG and 5-HMF, 
affect peroxynitrite (ONOO-) and nitration of tyrosine residues, Jurkat cell 
proliferation and caspase-activated apoptosis.
METHODS: The ONOO- luminol-induced chemiluminescence reaction was used to 
measure the ONOO- scavenging function of aKG or 5-HMF, and their protection 
against nitration of tyrosine residues on bovine serum albumin was estimated 
with the ELISA technique. The Jurkat cell line was cultivated in the absence or 
presence of aKG or 5-HMF solutions between 0 and 3.5 µM aKG or 0 and 4 µM 5-HMF. 
Jurkat cells were tested for cell proliferation, mitochondrial activity and 
caspase-activated apoptosis.
RESULTS: aKG showed a concentration-dependent reduction in ONOO-, resulting in a 
90% elimination of ONOO- using 200 mM aKG. In addition, 20 and 200 mM 5-HMF were 
able to reduce ONOO- only by 20%, while lower concentrations of 5-HMF remained 
stable in the presence of ONOO-. Nitration of tyrosine residues was inhibited 4 
fold more effectively with 5-HMF compared to aKG measuring the IC50%. Both 
substances, aKG and 5-HMF, were shown to cause a reduction in Jurkat cell growth 
that was dependent on the dose and incubation time. The aKG effectively reduced 
Jurkat cell growth down to 50% after 48 and 72 h of incubation using the highest 
concentration of 3.5 µM, and 1, 1.6, 2, 3 and 4 µM 5-HMF inhibited any cell 
growth within (i) 24 h; 1.6, 2, 3 and 4 µM 5-HMF within 48 h (ii); 2, 3 and 4 µM 
5-HMF within 72 h (iii). Furthermore, 4 µM was able to eliminate the starting 
cell number of 20,000 cells after 48 and 72 h down to 11,233 cells. The 
mitochondrial activity measurements supported the data on aKG or 5-HMF regarding 
cell growth in Jurkat cells, in both a dose- and incubation-time-dependent 
manner: the highest concentration of 3.5 µM aKG reduced the mitochondrial 
activity over 24 h (67.7%), 48 h (57.9%) and 72 h (46.8%) of incubation with 
Jurkat cells compared to the control incubation without aKG (100%). 5-HMF was 
more effective compared to aKG; the mitochondrial activity in the presence of 4 
µM 5-HMF decreased after 24 h down to 68.4%, after 48 h to 42.9% and after 72 h 
to 32.0%. Moreover, 1.7 and 3.4 µM aKG had no effect on caspase-3-activated 
apoptosis (0.58% and 0.56%) in the Jurkat cell line. However, 2 and 4 µM 5-HMF 
increased the caspase-3-activated apoptosis up to 22.1% and 42.5% compared to 
the control (2.9%). A combined solution of 1.7 µM aKG + 0.7 µM 5-HMF showed a 
higher caspase-3-activated apoptosis (15.7%) compared to 1.7 µM aKG or 2 µM 
5-HMF alone. In addition, 3.5 µM µg/mL aKG + 1.7 µM 5-HMF induced 
caspase-activated apoptosis up to 55.6% compared to 4.5% or 35.6% caspase-3 
activity using 3.5 µM aKG or 4 µM 5-HMF.
CONCLUSION: Both substances showed high antioxidative potential in eliminating 
either peroxynitrite or nitration of tyrosine residues, which results in a 
better inhibition of cell growth and mitochondrial activity of 5-HMF compared to 
aKG. However, caspase-3-activated apoptosis measurements revealed that the 
combination of both substances synergistically is the most effective compared to 
single compounds.

Multitargeted 6-Substituted Thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidines as Folate 
Receptor-Selective Anticancer Agents that Inhibit Cytosolic and Mitochondrial 
One-Carbon Metabolism.

Multitargeted agents with tumor selectivity result in reduced drug resistance 
and dose-limiting toxicities. We report 6-substituted thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine 
compounds (3-9) with pyridine (3, 4), fluorine-substituted pyridine (5), phenyl 
(6, 7), and thiophene side chains (8, 9), for comparison with unsubstituted 
phenyl (1, 2) and thiophene side chain (10, 11) containing 
thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine compounds. Compounds 3-9 inhibited proliferation of 
Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) expressing folate receptors (FRs) α or β but 
not the reduced folate carrier (RFC); modest inhibition of CHO cells expressing 
the proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT) by 4, 5, 6, and 9 was observed. 
Replacement of the side-chain 1',4'-phenyl ring with 2',5'-pyridyl, or 
2',5'-pyridyl with a fluorine insertion ortho to l-glutamate resulted in 
increased potency toward FR-expressing CHO cells. Toward KB tumor cells, 4-9 
were highly active (IC50's from 2.11 to 7.19 nM). By metabolite rescue in KB 
cells and in vitro enzyme assays, de novo purine biosynthesis was identified as 
a targeted pathway (at 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide 
formyltransferase (AICARFTase) and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase 
(GARFTase)). Compound 9 was 17- to 882-fold more potent than previously reported 
compounds 2, 10, and 11 against GARFTase. By targeted metabolomics and 
metabolite rescue, 1, 2, and 6 also inhibited mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyl 
transferase 2 (SHMT2); enzyme assays confirmed inhibition of SHMT2. X-ray 
crystallographic structures were obtained for 4, 5, 9, and 10 with human 
GARFTase. This series affords an exciting new structural platform for potent 
multitargeted antitumor agents with FR transport selectivity.

Beclin-1 dependent autophagy improves renal outcomes following Unilateral 
Ureteral Obstruction (UUO) injury.

Lopez-Soler RI(1)(2), Nikouee A(3), Kim M(3), Khan S(3), Sivaraman L(4), Ding 
X(5), Zang QS(3).

BACKGROUND: Interstitial Fibrosis and Tubular Atrophy (IFTA) is the most common 
cause of long-term graft failure following renal transplant. One of the 
hallmarks of IFTA is the development of interstitial fibrosis and loss of normal 
renal architecture. In this study, we evaluated the role of autophagy initiation 
factor Beclin-1 in protecting against post-renal injury fibrosis.
METHODS: Adult male wild type (WT) C57BL/6 mice were subjected to Unilateral 
Ureteral Obstruction (UUO), and kidney tissue samples were harvested at 72-hour, 
1- and 3-week post-injury. The UUO-injured and uninjured kidney samples were 
examined histologically for fibrosis, autophagy flux, inflammation as well 
activation of the Integrated Stress Response (ISR). We compared WT mice with 
mice carrying a forced expression of constitutively active mutant form of 
Beclin-1, Becn1F121A/F121A .
RESULTS: In all experiments, UUO injury induces a progressive development of 
fibrosis and inflammation. These pathological signs were diminished in 
Becn1F121A/F121A mice. In WT animals, UUO caused a strong blockage of autophagy 
flux, indicated by continuously increases in LC3II accompanied by an over 3-fold 
accumulation of p62 1-week post injury. However, increases in LC3II and 
unaffected p62 level by UUO were observed in Becn1F121A/F121A mice, suggesting 
an alleviation of disrupted autophagy. Beclin-1 F121A mutation causes a 
significant decrease in phosphorylation of inflammatory STING signal and limited 
production of IL6 and IFNγ, but had little effect on TNF-α, in response to UUO. 
Furthermore, activation of ISR signal cascade was detected in UUO-injured in 
kidneys, namely the phosphorylation signals of elF2S1 and PERK in addition to 
the stimulated expression of ISR effector ATF4. However, Becn1F121A/F121A mice 
did not reveal signs of elF2S1 and PERK activation under the same condition and 
had a dramatically reduced ATF level at 3-week post injury.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that UUO causes a insufficient, maladaptive 
renal autophagy, which triggered downstream activation of inflammatory STING 
pathway, production of cytokines, and pathological activation of ISR, eventually 
leading to the development of fibrosis. Enhancing autophagy via Beclin-1 
improved renal outcomes with diminished fibrosis, via underlying mechanisms of 
differential regulation of inflammatory mediators and control of maladaptive 
ISR.

Characterization of a unique polysaccharide monooxygenase from the plant 
pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae.

Martinez-D'Alto A(1), Yan X(2), Detomasi TC(3), Sayler RI(1), Thomas WC(1), 
Talbot NJ(2), Marletta MA(1)(3)(4).

Blast disease in cereal plants is caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae and 
accounts for a significant loss in food crops. At the outset of infection, 
expression of a putative polysaccharide monooxygenase (MoPMO9A) is increased. 
MoPMO9A contains a catalytic domain predicted to act on cellulose and a 
carbohydrate-binding domain that binds chitin. A sequence similarity network of 
the MoPMO9A family AA9 showed that 220 of the 223 sequences in the 
MoPMO9A-containing cluster of sequences have a conserved unannotated region with 
no assigned function. Expression and purification of the full length and two 
MoPMO9A truncations, one containing the catalytic domain and the domain of 
unknown function (DUF) and one with only the catalytic domain, were carried out. 
In contrast to other AA9 polysaccharide monooxygenases (PMOs), MoPMO9A is not 
active on cellulose but showed activity on cereal-derived mixed (1→3, 
1→4)-β-D-glucans (MBG). Moreover, the DUF is required for activity. MoPMO9A 
exhibits activity consistent with C4 oxidation of the polysaccharide and can 
utilize either oxygen or hydrogen peroxide as a cosubstrate. It contains a 
predicted 3-dimensional fold characteristic of other PMOs. The DUF is predicted 
to form a coiled-coil with six absolutely conserved cysteines acting as a zipper 
between the two α-helices. MoPMO9A substrate specificity and domain architecture 
are different from previously characterized AA9 PMOs. The results, including a 
gene ontology analysis, support a role for MoPMO9A in MBG degradation during 
plant infection. Consistent with this analysis, deletion of MoPMO9A results in 
reduced pathogenicity.

Neutralization of excessive CCL28 improves wound healing in diabetic mice.

Chen Z(1), Haus JM(2), DiPietro LA(3)(4), Koh TJ(3)(5), Minshall RD(1)(6).

Introduction: Chronic, non-healing skin wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers 
(DFUs) are common in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and often 
result in limb amputation and even death. However, mechanisms by which T2DM and 
inflammation negatively impact skin wound healing remains poorly understood. 
Here we investigate a mechanism by which an excessive level of chemokine CCL28, 
through its receptor CCR10, impairs wound healing in patients and mice with 
T2DM. Methods & Results: Firstly, a higher level of CCL28 was observed in skin 
and plasma in both patients with T2DM, and in obesity-induced type 2 diabetic 
db/db mice. Compared with WT mice, adipose tissue from db/db mice released 50% 
more CCL28, as well as 2- to 3-fold more IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, and less VEGF, 
as determined by ELISA measurements. Secondly, overexpression of CCL28 with 
adenovirus (Adv-CCL28) caused elevation of proinflammatory cytokines as well as 
CCR10 expression and also reduced eNOS expression in the dorsal skin of WT mice 
as compared with control Adv. Thirdly, topical application of neutralizing 
anti-CCL28 Ab dose-dependently accelerated wound closure and eNOS expression, 
and decreased IL-6 level, with an optimal dose of 1 μg/wound. In addition, mRNA 
levels of eNOS and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4 were increased as shown by 
real-time RT-PCR. The interaction between eNOS and CCR10 was significantly 
reduced in diabetic mouse wounds following application of the optimal dose of 
anti-CCL28 Ab, and eNOS expression increased. Finally, enhanced VEGF production 
and increased subdermal vessel density as indicated by CD31 immunostaining were 
also observed with anti-CCL28 Ab. Discussion: Taken together, topical 
application of neutralizing anti-CCL28 Ab improved dorsal skin wound healing by 
reducing CCR10 activation and inflammation in part by preventing eNOS 
downregulation, increasing VEGF production, and restoring angiogenesis. These 
results indicate anti-CCL28 Ab has significant potential as a therapeutic 
strategy for treatment of chronic non-healing diabetic skin wounds such as DFUs.

Identification and Pharmacological Characterization of Two Serotonin Type 7 
Receptor Isoforms from Mythimna separata.

Chen W(1), Gao X(1), Wang H(1), Xie G(1), An S(1), Du Y(2), Zhao X(1).

Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is an important neuroactive molecule, as 
neurotransmitters regulate various biological functions in vertebrates and 
invertebrates by binding and activating specific 5-HT receptors. The 
pharmacology and tissue distribution of 5-HT receptors have been investigated in 
several model insects, and these receptors are recognized as potential 
insecticide targets. However, little is known about the pharmacological 
characterization of the 5-HT receptors in important agricultural pests. In this 
study, we investigated the sequence, pharmacology, and tissue distribution of 
5-HT7 receptors from oriental armyworm Mythimna separata (Walker) (Lepidoptera: 
Noctuidae), an important migratory and polyphagous pest species. We found that 
the 5-HT7 receptor gene encodes two molecularly distinct transcripts, Msep5-HT7L 
and Msep5-HT7S, by the mechanism of alternative splicing in M. separata. 
Msep5-HT7S differs from Msep5-HT7L based on the deletion of 95 amino acids 
within the third intracellular loop. Two Msep5-HT7 receptor isoforms were 
activated by 5-HT and synthetic agonists α-methylserotonin, 8-hydroxy-DPAT, and 
5-methoxytryptamine, resulting in increased intracellular cAMP levels in a 
dose-dependent manner, although these agonists showed much poorer potency and 
efficacy than 5-HT. The maximum efficacy of 5-HT compared to the two 5-HT 
isoforms was equivalent, but 5-HT exhibited 2.63-fold higher potency against the 
Msep5-HT7S than the Msep5-HT7L receptor. These two isoforms were also blocked by 
the non-selective antagonist methiothepin and the selective antagonists 
WAY-100635, ketanserin, SB-258719, and SB-269970. Moreover, two distinct mRNA 
transcripts were expressed preferentially in the brain and chemosensory organs 
of M. separata adults, as determined by qPCR assay. This study is the first 
comprehensive characterization of two splicing isoforms of 5-HT7 receptors in M. 
separata, and the first to demonstrate that alternative splicing is also the 
mechanism for producing multiple 5-HT7 isoforms in insects. Pharmacological and 
gene expression profiles offer important information that could facilitate 
further exploration of their function in the central nervous system and 
peripheral chemosensory organs, and may even contribute to the development of 
new selective pesticides.

(4-Picolylamino)-17β-Estradiol derivative and analogues induce apoptosis with 
death receptor trail R2/DR5 in MCF-7.

Yin Y(1), Sun L(1), Sheng L(1), Zhang L(1), Liu J(1), Wen X(2), Mo W(3), Wang 
Q(4), Cheng K(5).

In order to discover more effective and less toxic drugs in the field of 
anti-tumor, the backbone structure of 17β-estradiol was modified, and 11 target 
compounds were synthesized. Compounds 5 and 10, which exhibited better 
anti-tumor activity and higher selectivity (more than 10-fold), were chosen for 
further biological investigation. Flow cytometry results indicated that 5 and 10 
could arrest MCF-7 cells in the G2 phase and induce apoptosis. 
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that 5 and 10 could bind to the estradiol 
receptor alpha in MCF-7 cells. Western blotting and real-time PCR assays were 
performed to detect the effects of compounds on apoptosis-related targets at the 
protein and gene levels. These results showed that both 5 and 10 could 
dosed-dependently increase the expression of Apaf-1, Bax, caspase-3,8,9 and 
reduce the expression levels of the anti-apoptotic factors Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. 
Besides, the Human apoptosis array assay demonstrated the expression level of 
death receptor Trail R2/DR5 was upregulated obviously while the expression of 
TNF R1, IAPs and Hsp27/60/70 were downregulated. On the whole, 5 induced 
MCF-7 cell death through the endogenous pathway in mitochondria and the 
exogenous pathway with death receptor Trail R2/DR5.

Blood-based protein biomarkers for the diagnosis of acute stroke: A 
discovery-based SWATH-MS proteomic approach.

Pandit AK(1), Aggarwal P(3), Srivastava AK(1), Mohania D(4), Prasad K(1)(5), 
Vibha D(1).

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSES: Recent developments in high-throughput proteomic 
approach have shown the potential to discover biomarkers for diagnosing acute 
stroke and to elucidate the pathomechanisms specific to different stroke 
subtypes. We aimed to determine blood-based protein biomarkers to diagnose total 
stroke (IS+ICH) from healthy controls, ischemic stroke (IS) from healthy 
controls, and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) from healthy control subjects 
within 24 h using a discovery-based SWATH-MS proteomic approach.
METHODS: In this discovery phase study, serum samples were collected within 24 h 
from acute stroke (IS & ICH) patients and healthy controls and were subjected to 
SWATH-MS-based untargeted proteomics. For protein identification, a high-pH 
fractionated peptide library for human serum proteins (obtained from SCIEX) 
comprising of 465 proteins was used. Significantly differentially expressed 
(SDE) proteins were selected using the following criteria: >1.5-fold change for 
upregulated, < 0.67 for downregulated, p-value < 0.05, and confirmed/tentative 
selection using Boruta random forest. Protein-protein interaction network 
analysis and the functional enrichment analysis were conducted using STRING 11 
online tool, g:Profiler tool and Cytoscape 3.9.0 software. The statistical 
analyses were conducted in R version 3.6.2.
RESULTS: Our study included 40 stroke cases (20 IS, 20 ICH) within 24 h and 40 
age-, sex-, hypertension-, and diabetes-matched healthy controls. We quantified 
375 proteins between the stroke cases and control groups through SWATH-MS 
analysis. We observed 31 SDE proteins between total stroke and controls, 16 SDE 
proteins between IS and controls, and 41 SDE proteins between ICH and controls 
within 24 h. Four proteins [ceruloplasmin, alpha-1-antitrypsin (SERPINA1), von 
Willebrand factor (vWF), and coagulation factor XIII B chain (F13B)] commonly 
differentiated total stroke, IS, and ICH from healthy control subjects. The most 
common significant pathways in stroke cases involved complement and coagulation 
cascades, platelet degranulation, immune-related processes, acute phase 
response, lipid-related processes, and pathways related to extracellular space 
and matrix.
CONCLUSION: Our discovery phase study identified potential protein biomarker 
candidates for the diagnosis of acute stroke and highlighted significant 
pathways associated with different stroke subtypes. These potential biomarker 
candidates warrant further validation in future studies with a large cohort of 
stroke patients to investigate their diagnostic performance.

N-Acetylcysteine or Sodium Selenite Prevent the p38-Mediated Production of 
Proinflammatory Cytokines by Microglia during Exposure to Mercury (II).

Branco V(1)(2), Coppo L(3), Aschner M(4), Carvalho C(1).

Mercury (Hg) is known for its neurotoxicity and is reported to activate 
microglia cells at low exposure levels. Since mercury decreases the activity of 
the glutathione and thioredoxin systems, we hypothesize that Hg would, in turn, 
disrupt microglia homeostasis by interfering with redox regulation of signaling 
pathways. Thus, in this work, we analyzed the effect of exposure to Hg2+ on 
nuclear translocation and activation of NF-kB (p50) and p38 and pro-inflammatory 
gene transcription (IL-1ß; iNOS, TNF-alpha) considering the interaction of Hg 
with the glutathione system and thioredoxin systems in microglial cells. N9 
(mouse) microglia cells were exposed to different concentrations of Hg2+ and the 
24 h EC50 for a reduction in viability was 42.1 ± 3.7 μM. Subsequent experiments 
showed that at sub-cytotoxic levels of Hg2+, there was a general increase in ROS 
(≈40%) accompanied by a significant depletion (60-90%) of glutathione (GSH) and 
thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) activity. Upon 6 h of exposure to Hg2+, p38 (but 
not p50) accumulated in the nucleus (50% higher than in control), which was 
accompanied by an increase in its phosphorylation. Transcript levels of both 
IL1-ß and iNOS were increased over two-fold relative to the control. 
Furthermore, pre-exposure of cells to the p38 inhibitor SB 239063 hindered the 
activation of cytokine transcription by Hg2+. These results show that disruption 
of redox systems by Hg2+ prompts the activation of p38 leading to transcription 
of pro-inflammatory genes in microglia cells. Treatment of N9 cells with NAC or 
sodium selenite-which caused an increase in basal GSH and TrxR levels, 
respectively, prevented the activation of p38 and the transcription of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines. This result demonstrates the importance of an 
adequate nutritional status to minimize the toxicity resulting from Hg exposure 
in human populations at risk.

Fingolimod does not prevent syndecan-4 shedding from the endothelial glycocalyx 
in a cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cell model of vascular injury.

Milford EM(1)(2), Meital L(3)(4), Kuballa A(3)(4), Reade MC(5)(6)(7), Russell 
FD(3)(4).

BACKGROUND: Shedding of the endothelial glycocalyx (EG) is associated with poor 
outcomes in a range of conditions including sepsis. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) 
restores the damaged EG to baseline thickness, however the mechanism for this 
effect is unknown, and some components of FFP have adverse effects unrelated to 
the EG. There is some limited evidence that sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) within 
FFP restores the EG by activating the endothelial cell S1P receptor 1 (S1PR1). 
However, there are disadvantages to using S1P clinically as an EG restorative 
therapy. A potential alternative is the S1PR agonist fingolimod (FTY720). The 
aim of this study was to assess whether FTY720 prevents EG shedding in injured 
cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells.
METHODS: Shedding of the EG was induced in cultured human umbilical vein 
endothelial cells (HUVECs) by exposure to adrenaline, TNF-α and H2O2. The cells 
were then assigned to one of six conditions for 4 h: uninjured and untreated, 
injured and untreated, injured and treated with FTY720 with and without the 
S1PR1 inhibitor W146, and injured and treated with 25% FFP with and without 
W146. Syndecan-4, a component of the EG, was measured in cell supernatants, and 
syndecan-4 and thrombomodulin mRNA expression was quantitated in cell lysates.
RESULTS: The injury resulted in a 2.1-fold increase in syndecan-4 (p < 0.001), 
consistent with EG shedding. Syndecan-4 and thrombomodulin mRNA expression was 
increased (p < 0.001) and decreased (p < 0.05), respectively, by the injury. 
Syndecan-4 shedding was not affected by treatment with FTY720, whereas FFP 
attenuated syndecan-4 shedding back to baseline levels in the injured cells and 
this was unaffected by W146. Neither treatment affected syndecan-4 or 
thrombomodulin mRNA expression.
CONCLUSIONS: FTY720 did not prevent syndecan-4 shedding from the EG in the HUVEC 
model of endothelial injury, suggesting that activation of S1PR does not prevent 
EG damage. FFP prevented syndecan-4 shedding from the EG via a mechanism that 
was independent of S1PR1 and upregulation of SDC-4 production. Further studies 
to examine whether FTY720 or another S1PR agonist might have EG-protective 
effects under different conditions are warranted, as are investigations seeking 
the mechanism of EG protection conferred by FFP in this experimental model.

INTRODUCTION: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a global health problem that 
can results in cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and even death. HCV infection 
is 3-20-fold more prevalent among patients with versus without severe mental 
illness (SMI), such as major depressive disorder, personality disorder, bipolar 
disorder and schizophrenia. Treatment options for HCV were formerly based on 
pegylated interferon alpha, which is associated with neuropsychiatric adverse 
events, and this contributed to the exclusion of patients with SMI from HCV 
treatment, elimination programmes, and clinical trials. Moreover, the assumption 
of poor adherence, scant access to healthcare and the stigma and vulnerability 
of this population emerged as barriers and contributed to the low rates of 
treatment and efficacy.
METHODS: This paper reviews the literature published between December 2010 and 
December 2020 exploring the epidemiology of HCV in patients with SMI, and vice 
versa, the effect of HCV infection, barriers to the management of illness in 
these patients, and benefits of new therapeutic options with pangenotypic direct 
antiviral agents (DAAs).
RESULTS: The approval of DAAs has changed the paradigm of HCV infection 
treatment. DAAs have proven to be an equally efficacious and safe option that 
improves quality of life (QoL) in patients SMI.
CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of the consequences of the HCV infection and the benefits 
of treatment with new pangenotypic DAAs among psychiatrists can increase 
screening, referral and treatment of HCV infection in patients with SMI.

Expansion of the S-CN-DABO scaffold to exploit the impact on inhibitory 
activities against the non-nucleoside HIV-1 reverse transcriptase.

Ling X(1), Hao QQ(1), Pannecouque C(2), Clercq E(2), Chen FE(3).

The α-cyanoarylmethyl-3, 4-dihydropyrimidin-4(3H)-ones (S-CN-DABOs) were 
reported as a kind of reverse transcriptase inhibitors of human immunodeficiency 
virus type-1 (HIV-1) by our group in 2007. In this paper, we proposed to expand 
the S-CN-DABO scaffold to enrich the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of 
the phenyl ring that was predicted to be located in the W229 hydrophobic pocket. 
Thirty-nine S-CN-DABO derivatives were manufactured to explore the impact on 
inhibitory activities against the non-nucleoside HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. 
These analogues displayed up to low nanomolar activity against wild-type (WT) 
HIV-1 and good activity against several clinically relevant resistant mutant 
viruses, especially rilpivirine-associated resistant mutant E138K strain. The 
inhibitory ability toward the RT enzyme was significantly improved. Compound B23 
with a 2, 6-difluoro-phenyl group showed inhibitory effects with an EC50 value 
of 20.8 nM against HIV-1 WT strain, and an EC50 of 50 nM targeting mutant E138K, 
which were about 20-fold better than the lead compound B1. Molecular docking 
analysis elucidated the biological activity and offered a structural insight for 
follow-up research. In addition, compound B23 also showed favorable drug-like 
properties in vitro and in vivo. There was no significant inhibition of hERG 
(IC50 > 40 μM), no apparent CYP enzymatic inhibitory activity and acute toxicity 
in mouse models. Perfect oral bioavailability of compound B23 was revealed 
(F = 164%, SD rats). In summary, these S-CN-DABOs compounds could be further 
optimized and modified for promising drug candidates in anti-HIV clinical 
therapy.

Erratum in
    Acta Biomater. 2022 Dec 17;:

Hair follicle (HF) regeneration remains challenging, principally due to the 
absence of a platform that can successfully generate the microenvironmental cues 
of hair neogenesis. Here, we demonstrate a 3D bioprinting technique based on a 
gelatin/alginate hydrogel (GAH) to construct a multilayer composite scaffold 
simulating the HF microenvironment in vivo. Fibroblasts (FBs), human umbilical 
vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), dermal papilla cells (DPCs), and epidermal 
cells (EPCs) were encapsulated in GAH (prepared from a mixture of gelatin and 
alginate) and respectively 3D-bioprinted into the different layers of a 
composite scaffold. The bioprinted scaffold with epidermis- and dermis-like 
structure was subsequently transplanted into full-thickness wounds in nude mice. 
The multilayer scaffold demonstrated suitable cytocompatibility and increased 
the proliferation ability of DPCs (1.2-fold; P < 0.05). It also facilitated the 
formation of self-aggregating DPC spheroids and restored DPC genes associated 
with hair induction (ALP, β-catenin, and α-SMA). The dermal and epidermal cells 
self-assembled successfully into immature HFs in vitro. HFs were regenerated in 
the appropriate orientation in vivo, which can mainly be attributed to the 
hierarchical grid structure of the scaffold and the dot bioprinting of DPCs. Our 
3D printed scaffolds provide a suitable microenvironment for DPCs to regenerate 
entire HFs and could make a significant contribution in the medical management 
of hair loss. This method may also have broader applications in skin tissue (and 
appendage) engineering. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Hair loss remains a 
challenging clinical problem that influences quality of life. Three-dimensional 
(3D) bioprinting has become a useful tool for the fabrication of tissue 
constructs for transplantation and other biomedical applications. In this study, 
we used a 3D bioprinting technique based on a gelatin/alginate hydrogel to 
construct a multi-layer composite scaffold with cuticular and corium layers to 
simulate the microenvironment of dermal papilla cells (DPCs) in the human body. 
This new approach permits the controllable formation of self-aggregating 
spheroids of DPCs in a physiologically relevant extracellular matrix and the 
initiation of epidermal-mesenchymal interactions, which results in HF formation 
in vivo. The ability to regenerate entire HFs should have a significant impact 
on the medical management of hair loss.

Dietary Lactoferrin Supplementation Improves Growth Performance and Intestinal 
Health of Juvenile Orange-Spotted Groupers (Epinephelus coioides).

Song T(1), Qin Y(1), Ke L(1), Wang X(2), Wang K(1), Sun Y(1), Ye J(1).

A 56-day feeding trial was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary 
lactoferrin (LF) supplementation on the growth performance and intestinal health 
of juvenile orange-spotted groupers fed high-soybean-meal (SBM) diets. The 
control diet (FM) and high-soybean-meal diet (SBM60) were prepared to contain 
480 g/kg protein and 110 g/kg fat. Three inclusion levels of 2, 6, and 10 g/kg 
LF were added into the SBM60 to prepare three diets (recorded as LF2, LF6, and 
LF10, respectively). The results showed that the supplementation of LF in SBM60 
increased the growth rate in a dose-dependent manner. However, the feed 
utilization, hepatosomatic index, whole-body proximate composition, and the 
abundance and diversity of intestinal microbiota did not vary across the dietary 
treatments (p > 0.05). After the dietary intervention with LF, the contents of 
the intestinal malondialdehyde, endotoxin, and d-lactic acid, as well as the 
plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol, and total cholesterol were lower, and the intestinal activities of 
the glutathione peroxidase, lipase, trypsin, and protease were higher in the 
LF2-LF10 groups than that in the SBM60 group (p < 0.05). The supplementation of 
LF in SBM60 increased the muscle layer thickness of the middle and distal 
intestine and the mucosal fold length of the middle intestine vs. the SBM60 diet 
(p < 0.05). Furthermore, the supplementation of LF in SBM60 resulted in an 
up-regulation of the mRNA levels for the IL-10 and TGF-β1 genes and a 
down-regulation of the mRNA levels of the IL-1β, IL-12, IL-8, and TNF-α genes 
vs. the SBM60 diet (p < 0.05). The above results showed that a dietary LF 
intervention improves the growth and alleviates soybean meal-induced enteritis 
in juvenile orange-spotted groupers. The dietary appropriate level of LF was at 
5.8 g/kg, through the regression analysis of the percent weight gain against the 
dietary LF inclusion levels.

Y(1)(8).

BACKGROUND: We aimed to assess the differences in the gut microbiome among 
participants with different uric acid levels (hyperuricemia [HUA] patients, low 
serum uric acid [LSU] patients, and controls with normal levels) and to develop 
a model to predict HUA based on microbial biomarkers.
METHODS: We sequenced the V3-V4 variable region of the 16S rDNA gene in 168 
fecal samples from HUA patients (n=50), LSU patients (n=61), and controls 
(n=57). We then analyzed the differences in the gut microbiome between these 
groups. To identify gut microbial biomarkers, the 107 HUA patients and controls 
were randomly divided (2:1) into development and validation groups and 10-fold 
cross-validation of a random forest model was performed. We then established 
three diagnostic models: a clinical model, microbial biomarker model, and 
combined model.
RESULTS: The gut microbial α diversity, in terms of the Shannon and Simpson 
indices, was decreased in LSU and HUA patients compared to controls, but only 
the decreases in the HUA group were significant (P=0.0029 and P=0.013, 
respectively). The phylum Proteobacteria (P<0.001) and genus Bacteroides 
(P=0.02) were significantly increased in HUA patients compared to controls, 
while the genus Ruminococcaceae_Ruminococcus was decreased (P=0.02). Twelve 
microbial biomarkers were identified. The area under the curve (AUC) for these 
biomarkers in the development group was 84.9% (P<0.001). Notably, an AUC of 
89.1% (P<0.001) was achieved by combining the microbial biomarkers and clinical 
factors.
CONCLUSIONS: The combined model is a reliable tool for predicting HUA and could 
be used to assist in the clinical evaluation of patients and prevention of HUA.

Purification, Biochemical and Kinetic Characterization of a Novel Alkaline 
sn-1,3-Regioselective Triacylglycerol Lipase from Penicilliumcrustosum Thom 
Strain P22 Isolated from Moroccan Olive Mill Wastewater.

Jaouadi B(3), Noiriel A(1), Asehraou A(2), Abousalham A(1).

A novel extracellular lipase from a filamentous fungus Ascomycota strain, P22, 
was isolated from olive mill wastewater, then purified and characterized. This 
strain was identified as Penicillium crustosum Thom based on sequencing 
analyses. Penicilliumcrustosum Thom strain P22 lipase (PCrL) was purified 
63-fold to homogeneity using ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatography 
on a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column, with a total yield of 34%. The purified PCrL 
had a molecular mass of 28 kDa, estimated by SDS-PAGE. The 20 NH2-terminal 
amino-acid residues showed a high degree of homology with those of other 
Penicillium lipases. The specific activity of PCrL at pH 9 and 37 °C were found 
to be 5000 and 10,000 U/mg on olive oil and trioctanoin emulsions, respectively. 
PCrL exhibited clear regioselectivity toward the sn-1 position of the 
surface-coated triglycerides which were esterified with α-eleostearic acid at 
the sn-1/3 position. PCrL was completely inhibited by 53 µM of Orlistat, 5 mM of 
phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, and 2 mM of diiodopropyl fluorophosphate, 
suggesting that it belonged to the serine lipase family. PCrL showed high 
activity and stability in the presence of water-immiscible organic solvents, 
surfactant, and oxidizing agents, and showed considerable compatibility with 
commercial laundry detergents. Washing performance analysis revealed that it 
could effectively remove oil stains. Hence, PCrL has several attractive 
properties that make it a promising potential candidate for detergent 
formulations.

G(5), Giordari F(5), Comaro E(5), Colizzi F(5), Baboçi L(5), Steffan A(5), 
Revelant A(4), Muraro E(6).

PURPOSE: The present study aimed at evaluating the baseline immune profile and 
the immunomodulating effects of radical hemithoracic radiation therapy (RT) in 
patients affected by malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) to identify potential 
predictive biomarkers of therapy response, toxicity development, and eligibility 
for further immunotherapeutic treatments.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Blood samples were collected from 55 patients with MPM, 
enrolled in a phase 3 trial comparing radical hemithoracic RT (interventional 
arm, n = 28) with local palliative RT (control arm, n = 27). Immunomonitoring 
was performed before RT, at the end of treatment, and 1 month after therapy, 
characterizing natural killer cells, B and T lymphocytes, activated CD4 and CD8 
T cells, interferon-γ- and tumor necrosis factor-α-producing T helper (Th) 1 
cells, regulatory T cells, and Th17 and Th22 lymphocytes, through flow 
cytometry. Serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6, -8, -10 and mesothelin were 
quantified through Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) assays at the same 
time points. Variations in the immune parameters were investigated by Friedman 
test and Wilcoxon signed rank post hoc test with Bonferroni correction for 
multiple testing, while the prognostic effect of immune biomarkers was evaluated 
through Kaplan-Meier method and Spearman's correlation analysis.
RESULTS: Major immune variations were noticed after radical RT compared with 
palliative treatment, in particular an improvement in activated T cells and in 
interferon-γ-producing Th1 cells after RT. In the interventional arm, baseline 
high levels of Th22 and IL-10 and an increase in T cells were associated with an 
improved survival, whereas a fold increase in serum mesothelin correlated with 
the development of severe toxicity. An improvement of immunosuppressive 
regulatory T cells was observed in both arms of treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The immunomonitoring performed in patients with MPM revealed 
potential prognostic biomarkers for radical hemithoracic RT treatment and 
identified specific immune signatures induced by RT immunomodulation, which 
could suggest a synergistic effect with an immunotherapeutic treatment.

Terpenoid-Rich Extract of Dillenia indica L. Bark Displays Antidiabetic Action 
in Insulin-Resistant C2C12 Cells and STZ-Induced Diabetic Mice by Attenuation of 
Oxidative Stress.

Song BR(1), Alam MB(1)(2), Lee SH(1)(2).

Insulin resistance (IR) plays a key role in the pathogenesis and clinical 
outcome of patients with multiple diseases and diabetes. In this study, we 
examined the antidiabetic effects of a terpenoid-rich extract from Dillenia 
indica L. bark (TRDI) in palmitic acid-induced insulin resistance (PA-IR) in 
C2C12 myotube and a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice model and 
explored the possible underlying mechanism. TRDI showed potential DPPH- and 
ABTS-radical scavenging effects with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration 
(IC50) value of 9.76 ± 0.50 µg/mL and 17.47 ± 1.31 µg/mL, respectively. 
Furthermore, TRDI strongly mitigated α-glucosidase activity with an IC50 value 
of 3.03 ± 1.01 µg/mL, which was 92-fold higher than the positive control, 
acarbose (IC50 = 279.49 ± µg/mL). TRDI stimulated the insulin receptor 
substrarte-1 (INS-1), downregulated phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) 
and protein kinase B (Akt) in both normal and PA-IR C2C12 cells as well as in 
STZ-induced diabetic mice, enhanced glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) translocation 
to the plasma membrane (PM), and increased glucose absorption. Furthermore, TRDI 
administration significantly reduced PA-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
formation in C2C12 cells and increased the protein level of numerous antioxidant 
enzymes such as superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), catalase (CAT), glutathione 
peroxidase-1 (GPx-1) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) both in vitro and in vivo. 
Furthermore, TRDI facilitated nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) 
nuclear translocation and increased HO-1 expression in PA-IR C2C12 cells and 
STZ-induced diabetic mice. However, for the inhibition of Nrf2, TRDI failed to 
resist the effects of IR. Thus, this study provides new evidence to support the 
use of TRDI for diabetes treatment.

Proteomic Analysis Reveals the Vital Role of Synaptic Plasticity in the 
Pathogenesis of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy.

JJ(1), Zhong JG(2), Zhang TY(1), He SQ(1), Ji WD(3), Li W(4), Zhang M(1).

Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a chronic neurological disorder that is often 
resistant to antiepileptic drugs. The pathogenesis of TLE is extremely 
complicated and remains elusive. Understanding the molecular mechanisms 
underlying TLE is crucial for its diagnosis and treatment. In the present study, 
a lithium-pilocarpine-induced TLE model was employed to reveal the pathological 
changes of hippocampus in rats. Hippocampal samples were taken for proteomic 
analysis at 2 weeks after the onset of spontaneous seizure (a chronic stage of 
epileptogenesis). Isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantization (iTRAQ) 
coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) technique 
was applied for proteomic analysis of hippocampus. A total of 4173 proteins were 
identified from the hippocampi of epileptic rats and its control, of which 27 
differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were obtained with a fold change > 1.5 
and P < 0.05. Bioinformatics analysis indicated 27 DEPs were mainly enriched in 
"regulation of synaptic plasticity and structure" and "calmodulin-dependent 
protein kinase activity," which implicate synaptic remodeling may play a vital 
role in the pathogenesis of TLE. Consequently, the synaptic plasticity-related 
proteins and synaptic structure were investigated to verify it. It has been 
demonstrated that CaMKII-α, CaMKII-β, and GFAP were significant upregulated 
coincidently with proteomic analysis in the hippocampus of TLE rats. Moreover, 
the increased dendritic spines and hippocampal sclerosis further proved that 
synaptic plasticity involves in the development of TLE. The present study may 
help to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis and 
provide a basis for further studies on synaptic plasticity in TLE.

Identifying inadequate response among patients with ankylosing spondylitis and 
psoriatic arthritis prescribed advanced therapy in a real-world, commercially 
insured adult population in the USA.

J(3), Griffing K(3), Lisse J(3), Curtis JR(5).

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess treatment patterns and frequency of 
inadequate response associated with advanced therapy initiation among patients 
with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in the USA.
METHODS: Adult patients with AS or PsA who initiated advanced therapy were 
identified from the HealthCore Integrated Research Database®. Inadequate 
response to advanced therapies (tumour necrosis factor inhibitors [TNFi] and 
non-TNFi biologics) was identified using a claims-based algorithm. Factors 
influencing inadequate response were assessed using multivariable logistic 
regression.
RESULTS: In total, 646 patients with AS, and 1433 patients with PsA were 
evaluated. Among patients with AS (mean age, 43 years; male, 58%), 93% patients 
initiated TNFi, and 69% of patients had inadequate response. In patients with 
PsA (mean age, 49 years; male, 47%), 67% initiated TNFi, and 77% had inadequate 
response. Low adherence was the main predictor of inadequate response in 
patients with AS (56%) and PsA (63%). Inadequate responders were more likely to 
be female (odds ratio [OR] 2.05 for AS and 1.37 for PsA). Prior exposure to TNFi 
was associated with 3.89- and 2.14-fold greater odds of inadequate response in 
both AS and PsA patients, respectively, while patients using methotrexate were 
less likely to have inadequate response (OR 0.48 for AS and 0.72 for PsA; all 
p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Over 69% of patients with AS and 77% of patients with PsA had 
inadequate response to their index advanced therapy during 1 year after 
initiation. Health plan claims data appear useful to classify inadequate 
responders in AS and PsA. Key Points • Estimating inadequate response to 
advanced therapies and identifying factors associated with this outcome using 
claims data could improve treatment outcomes in AS and PsA. • In a sample of 
commercially insured US patients, over 69% of patients with AS and 77% of 
patients with PsA had inadequate response to their index advanced therapy during 
1 year after initiation. Patient characteristics such as sex and prior therapy 
use were predictive of inadequate response to advanced therapies. • Health plan 
claims data appear useful to classify inadequate responders in AS and PsA and 
identify factors associated with this outcome.

The Obstetrical Care and Delivery Experience of Women with Epilepsy in the 
MONEAD Study.

Grobman W(6), Dolan M(7), Chang P(8), Flood-Schaffer K(9), Parker L(10), Meador 
KJ(11), Pennell PB(12); MONEAD Investigator Group.

OBJECTIVE:  We examined mode of delivery among pregnant women with epilepsy 
(PWWE) versus pregnant controls (PC). We hypothesize that PWWE are more likely 
to deliver by cesarean.
STUDY DESIGN:  The Maternal Outcomes and Neurodevelopmental Effects of 
Antiepileptic Drugs (MONEAD) study is an observational, prospective, multicenter 
investigation of pregnancy outcomes funded by the National Institute of Health 
(NIH). MONEAD enrolled patients from December 2012 through January 2016. PWWE 
were matched to PC in a case:control ratio of 3:1. This analysis had 80% power 
to detect a 36% increase in cesarean frequency assuming a baseline rate of 30% 
among PC at an α = 0.05.
RESULTS:  This report analyzed 331 PWWE (76%) and 102 PC (24%) who gave birth 
while enrolled in the study. PWWE and PC had similar rates of cesarean delivery 
(34.7 vs. 28.6%; p = 0.27). Of women with cesarean, rates of cesarean without 
labor were similar between groups for those delivering in recruitment hospitals 
(48.2 vs. 50.0%) but in nonrecruitment hospitals, cesarean rates without labor 
were over two-fold higher among PWWE than those of PC (68.8 vs. 30.8%; 
p = 0.023). Receipt of a cesarean after labor did not differ for PWWE compared 
to PC or by type of antiepileptic drug among the PWWE.
CONCLUSION:  These findings suggest that the obstetrical experiences of PWWE and 
PC are similar. An interesting deviation from this observation was the mode of 
delivery with higher unlabored cesarean rates occurring among PWWE in 
nonrecruitment hospitals. As the study recruitment hospitals were tertiary 
academic centers and nonrecruitment hospitals tended to be community-based 
institutions, differences in perinatal expertise might contribute to this 
difference.
KEY POINTS: · Unlabored cesarean rates higher among women with epilepsy.. · 
Provider preference may influence delivery mode among women with epilepsy.. · 
Type and amount of antiepileptic drug was not associated with mode of delivery..

Development of a Multivariate Prognostic Model for Lenvatinib Treatment in 
Hepatocellular Carcinoma.

Li X(1), Ding X(1), Liu M(2), Wang J(3), Li W(1), Chen J(1).

BACKGROUND: Lenvatinib is a first-line agent for advanced hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC), but individual responses to treatment are highly heterogeneous. 
The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical parameters that influence 
the efficacy of Lenvatinib and to develop a prognostic model.
METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 333 Lenvatinib-treated patients with HCC 
with a median age of 57 years. Two hundred nd sixty-three of these patients had 
BCLC (2022) stage C. The median overall survival (mOS) time within the cohort 
was 12.1 months, and the median progression-free survival (mPFS) time was 4.7 
months. Univariate Cox regression, best subset regression, and Lasso regression 
were used to screen primary variables for possible contribution to OS, 
multivariate Cox analysis was used to fit selected models, and the final model 
was selected using the maximum area under the curve (AUC) and minimum AIC. 
Receiver operating curves (ROC), calibration curves, and decision curve analysis 
were plotted to assess model performance, and 5-fold cross-validation was 
performed for internal validation. X-tile software was used to select the best 
cutoff points and to divide the study cohort into 3 different risk groups.
RESULTS: Seven variables were included in the final model: BCLC stage, prior 
transarterial chemoembolization and immunotherapy history, tumor number, 
prognostic nutritional index, log (alpha-fetoprotein), and log 
(platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio). We named this final model the "multivariate 
prognostic model for Lenvatinib" (MPML), and a nomogram was constructed to 
predict the probability of survival at 6, 9, and 12 months. The MPML had good 
discrimination, calibration, and applicability. Cross-validation showed mean AUC 
values of 0.7779, 0.7738, and 0.7871 at 6, 9, and 12 months, respectively. 
According to nomogram points, mOS time was 21.57, 8.70, and 5.37 months in the 
low, medium, and high-risk groups, respectively (P < .001), and these 
differences were also observed in the PFS survival curve (P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: The MPML stratified patients according to baseline clinical 
characteristics had a strong performance in predicting Lenvatinib efficacy and 
has the potential for use as an auxiliary clinical tool for individualized 
decision-making.

Perioperative Analgesics and Anesthesia as Risk Factors for Postoperative 
Chronic Opioid Use in Patients Undergoing Total Knee Arthroplasty: A 
Retrospective Cohort Study Using Japanese Hospital Claims Data.

Nozawa K(1)(2), Lin Y(3), Ebata N(3)(4), Wakabayashi R(5), Ushida T(6), Deie 
M(7), Kikuchi S(3).

BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic postsurgical pain are commonly prescribed 
opioids chronically because of refractory pain although chronic opioid use can 
cause various severe problems.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate postoperative chronic opioid use and its 
association with perioperative pain management in patients who underwent a total 
knee arthroplasty in a Japanese real-world clinical setting.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using an administrative 
claims database. We used a multivariate logistic regression analysis to examine 
the association between perioperative analgesic and anesthesia prescriptions and 
postoperative chronic opioid use. We calculated all-cause medication and medical 
costs for each patient.
RESULTS: Of the 23,537,431 patient records, 14,325 patients met the criteria and 
were included in the analyses. There were 5.4% of patients with postoperative 
chronic opioid use. Perioperative prescriptions of weak opioids, strong and weak 
opioids, and the α2δ ligand were significantly associated with postoperative 
chronic opioid use (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 7.22 [3.89, 
13.41], 7.97 [5.07, 12.50], and 1.45 [1.13, 1.88], respectively). Perioperative 
combined prescriptions of general and local anesthesia were also significantly 
associated with postoperative chronic opioid use (3.37 [2.23, 5.08]). These 
medications and local anesthesia were more commonly prescribed on the day 
following surgery, after routinely used medications and general anesthesia were 
prescribed. The median total direct costs were approximately 1.3-fold higher 
among patients with postoperative chronic opioid use than those without 
postoperative chronic opioid use.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients who require supplementary prescription of analgesics for 
acute postsurgical pain are at high risk of postoperative chronic opioid use and 
these prescriptions should be given careful consideration to mitigate the 
patient burden.

Exploring and Learning the Universe of Protein Allostery Using Artificial 
Intelligence Augmented Biophysical and Computational Approaches.

Agajanian S(1), Alshahrani M(1), Bai F(2), Tao P(3), Verkhivker GM(1)(4).

Allosteric mechanisms are commonly employed regulatory tools used by proteins to 
orchestrate complex biochemical processes and control communications in cells. 
The quantitative understanding and characterization of allosteric molecular 
events are among major challenges in modern biology and require integration of 
innovative computational experimental approaches to obtain atomistic-level 
knowledge of the allosteric states, interactions, and dynamic conformational 
landscapes. The growing body of computational and experimental studies empowered 
by emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has opened up new 
paradigms for exploring and learning the universe of protein allostery from 
first principles. In this review we analyze recent developments in 
high-throughput deep mutational scanning of allosteric protein functions; 
applications and latest adaptations of Alpha-fold structural prediction methods 
for studies of protein dynamics and allostery; new frontiers in integrating 
machine learning and enhanced sampling techniques for characterization of 
allostery; and recent advances in structural biology approaches for studies of 
allosteric systems. We also highlight recent computational and experimental 
studies of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) proteins revealing an important and often 
hidden role of allosteric regulation driving functional conformational changes, 
binding interactions with the host receptor, and mutational escape mechanisms of 
S proteins which are critical for viral infection. We conclude with a summary 
and outlook of future directions suggesting that AI-augmented biophysical and 
computer simulation approaches are beginning to transform studies of protein 
allostery toward systematic characterization of allosteric landscapes, hidden 
allosteric states, and mechanisms which may bring about a new revolution in 
molecular biology and drug discovery.

A novel consensus-based computational pipeline for screening of antibody 
therapeutics for efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern including 
Omicron variant.

Kumar N(1), Kaushik R(2)(3), Zhang KYJ(3), Uversky VN(4)(5), Sahu U(1), Sood 
R(1), Bhatia S(1).

Multiple severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants 
continue to evolve carrying flexible amino acid substitutions in the spike 
protein's receptor binding domain (RBD). These substitutions modify the binding 
of the SARS-CoV-2 to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor and 
have been implicated in altered host fitness, transmissibility, and efficacy 
against antibody therapeutics and vaccines. Reliably predicting the binding 
strength of SARS-CoV-2 variants RBD to hACE2 receptor and neutralizing 
antibodies (NAbs) can help assessing their fitness, and rapid deployment of 
effective antibody therapeutics, respectively. Here, we introduced a two-step 
computational framework with 3-fold validation that first identified 
dissociation constant as a reliable predictor of binding affinity in hetero- 
dimeric and trimeric protein complexes. The second step implements dissociation 
constant as descriptor of the binding strengths of SARS-CoV-2 variants RBD to 
hACE2 and NAbs. Then, we examined several variants of concerns (VOCs) such as 
Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron and demonstrated that these VOCs RBD bind 
to the hACE2 with enhanced affinity. Furthermore, the binding affinity of 
Omicron variant's RBD was reduced with majority of the RBD-directed NAbs, which 
is highly consistent with the experimental neutralization data. By studying the 
atomic contacts between RBD and NAbs, we revealed the molecular footprints of 
four NAbs (GH-12, P2B-1A1, Asarnow_3D11, and C118)-that may likely neutralize 
the recently emerged Omicron variant-facilitating enhanced binding affinity. 
Finally, our findings suggest a computational pathway that could aid researchers 
identify a range of current NAbs that may be effective against emerging 
SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Muscle PGC-1α modulates hepatic mitophagy regulation during aging.

Christensen NM(1), Ringholm S(1), Buch BT(1), Gudiksen A(1), Halling JF(1), 
Pilegaard H(2).

Aging has been suggested to be associated with changes in oxidative capacity, 
autophagy, and mitophagy in the liver, but a simultaneous evaluation of these 
key cellular processes is lacking. Moreover, skeletal muscle transcriptional 
coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 
(PGC)-1α has been reported to mediate inter-organ signaling through myokines 
with regulatory effects in the liver, but the potential role of muscle PGC-1α on 
hepatic changes with age remains to be resolved. The aim of the present study 
was therefore to investigate 1) the effect of aging on mitochondrial autophagy 
and mitophagy capacity in mouse liver and 2) whether muscle PGC-1α is required 
for maintaining autophagy and mitophagy capacity in the liver during aging. The 
liver was obtained from young (Young) and aged (Aged) inducible muscle-specific 
PGC-1α knockout (iMKO) and floxed littermate control mice (Lox). Aging increased 
liver p62, Parkin and BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 
(BNIP)3 protein with no effect of muscle specific PGC-1α knockout, while liver 
Microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3(LC3) II/I was unchanged with 
age, but tended to be lower in iMKO mice than in controls. Markers of liver 
mitochondrial oxidative capacity and oxidative stress were unchanged with age 
and iMKO. However, Parkin protein levels in isolated liver mitochondria were 
2-fold higher in Aged iMKO mice than in Aged controls. In conclusion, aging had 
no effect on oxidative capacity and lipid peroxidation in the liver. However, 
aging was associated with increased levels of autophagy and mitophagy markers. 
Moreover, muscle PGC-1α appears to regulate hepatic mitochondrial translocation 
of Parkin in aged mice, suggesting that the metabolic capacity of skeletal 
muscle can modulate mitophagy regulation in the liver during aging.

bovine disease of great economic and veterinary importance in Africa. 
Papain-like cysteine proteases play important roles in protozoan parasite host 
cell entry and egress, nutrition and host immune evasion. This study reports the 
identification and characterisation of a T. parva strain Muguga cathepsin L-like 
(C1A subfamily) cysteine protease (ThpCP). Molecular modelling confirmed the 
papain-like fold of ThpCP, hydrophobic character of the S2 substrate binding 
pocket and non-covalent interaction between the pro- and catalytic domains 
preceding low pH autoactivation. ThpCP was recombinantly expressed in a protease 
deficient E. coli (Rosetta (DE3)pLysS strain) expression host as a 46 kDa 
proenzyme. Following Ni-chelate affinity chromatography and acidification, the 
27 kDa mature ThpCP was purified by cation-exchange chromatography. Purified 
ThpCP hydrolysed typical cathepsin L substrates N-α-benzyloxycarbonyl 
(Z)-Phe-Arg-7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin (AMC) (kcat/Km = 4.49 × 105 s-1M-1) and 
Z-Leu-Arg-AMC (kcat/Km = 4.20 × 105 s-1M-1), but showed no activity against the 
cathepsin B-selective substrate Z-Arg-Arg-AMC. Recombinant ThpCP was active over 
a broad pH range from pH 4.5 to 7.5, thereby showing potential activity in the 
acidic parasite food vacuole and close to neutral pH of the host lymphocyte 
cytoplasm. Recombinant ThpCP was inhibited by the cysteine protease inhibitors 
E64, iodoacetate, leupeptin, chymostatin, Z-Phe-Ala-diazomethylketone (DMK) and 
Z-Phe-Phe-DMK and hydrolysed bovine proteins: haemoglobin, immunoglobulin G, 
serum albumin and fibrinogen as well as goat IgG at pH 6 and 7. Functional 
expression and characterisation of Theileria cysteine proteases should enable 
high throughput screening of cysteine protease inhibitor libraries against these 
proteases.

    Sleep. 2022 Dec 01;:

Transient oscillatory events in the sleep electroencephalogram represent 
short-term coordinated network activity. Of particular importance, sleep 
spindles are transient oscillatory events associated with memory consolidation, 
which are altered in aging and in several psychiatric and neurodegenerative 
disorders. Spindle identification, however, currently contains implicit 
assumptions derived from what waveforms were historically easiest to discern by 
eye, and has recently been shown to select only a high-amplitude subset of 
transient events. Moreover, spindle activity is typically averaged across a 
sleep stage, collapsing continuous dynamics into discrete states. What 
information can be gained by expanding our view of transient oscillatory events 
and their dynamics? In this paper, we develop a novel approach to 
electroencephalographic phenotyping, characterizing a generalized class of 
transient time-frequency events across a wide frequency range using continuous 
dynamics. We demonstrate that the complex temporal evolution of transient events 
during sleep is highly stereotyped when viewed as a function of slow oscillation 
power (an objective, continuous metric of depth-of-sleep) and phase (a correlate 
of cortical up/down states). This two-fold power-phase representation has large 
intersubject variability-even within healthy controls-yet strong night-to-night 
stability for individuals, suggesting a robust basis for phenotyping. As a 
clinical application, we then analyze patients with schizophrenia, confirming 
established spindle (12-15 Hz) deficits as well as identifying novel differences 
in transient non-rapid eye movement events in low-alpha (7-10 Hz) and theta (4-6 
Hz) ranges. Overall, these results offer an expanded view of transient activity, 
describing a broad class of events with properties varying continuously across 
spatial, temporal, and phase-coupling dimensions.

Kinetics of omega-3 fatty acid transfer to milk differs between fatty acids and 
stage of lactation in dairy cows.

Urrutia NL(1), Baldin M(2), Egolf SR(3), Walker RE(4), Ying Y(5), Green MH(4), 
Harvatine KJ(6).

Fatty acids (FA) differ in their transfer efficiencies and metabolic 
partitioning and lactating cows provide a robust model to investigate kinetics 
of FA transport. The objective was to compare kinetics of n-3 polyunsaturated FA 
(PUFA) trafficking through plasma and into milk. In the first experiment, ten 
ruminally cannulated multiparous Holstein cows were used in a crossover design 
with 7 d periods. Cows were milked at 6 h intervals and abomasal treatments 
provided a single dose of 80.1 g of α-linolenic acid as free FA (ALA-FFA) or 
45.5 g EPA and 32.9 g DHA (LCn3-FFA). Transfer of n-3 PUFA to milk was nearly 
50% higher for ALA-FFA than LCn3-FFA (48.2 and 32.7% of the bolus) and fit a 
bi-exponential model. Rapid transport of n-3 PUFA, assumed to be directly 
through chylomicrons, was nearly twice as high in ALA-FFA than LCn3-FFA and the 
subsequent slow transport, assumed to be indirect transfer through tissue 
recycling, was over 2.5-fold higher in LCn3-FFA than in ALA-FFA. Plasma analysis 
revealed LCn3-FFA enriched phospholipids and cholesterol esters, which had a 
slow clearance. In the second experiment, 4 cows received a bolus of a mixture 
of ALA, EPA, and DHA prepartum while not lactating and around d 10, 55, and 225 
of lactation. Transfer of ALA to milk did not differ between stages of 
lactation, but DHA was lower in early compared to mid and late lactation. In 
conclusion, dietary ALA is rapidly and efficiently transferred to milk in cows 
while EPA and DHA are rapidly incorporated into plasma or tissue fractions not 
available to the mammary gland. This demonstrates clear differences in 
trafficking and partitioning of n-3 PUFA that ultimately impact tissue and 
organelle enrichment with implications for effective doses.

Oral empagliflozin-loaded tri-layer core-sheath fibers fabricated using 
tri-axial electrospinning: Enhanced in vitro and in vivo antidiabetic 
performance.

G(4), Duruksu G(4), Graça MPF(5), Kalaskar DM(6), Gunduz O(7), Emin Cam M(8).

Empagliflozin (EM) was successfully loaded in polycaprolactone/poly (L-lactic 
acid)/polymethyl methacrylate (PCL/PLA/PMMA) fibers. In the rat β-cell line 
(BRIN-BD11), the insulin expression ratio of pancreatic β-cells was stimulated 
at high and low glucose by culturing with tri-layer EM-loaded fiber (EMF) for 
48 h. The expression ratios of glucokinase and GLUT-2 proteins increased after 
EMF treatment. According to the in vitro drug release test, 97% of all drug 
contained in fibers was released in a controlled manner for 24 h. The 
pharmacokinetic test revealed that the bioavailability was improved ∼4.8-fold 
with EMF treatment compared to EM-powder and blood glucose level was effectively 
controlled for 24 h with EMF. Oral administration of EMF exhibited a better 
sustainable anti-diabetic activity even in the half-dosage than EM-powder in 
streptozotocin/nicotinamide-induced T2DM rats. The levels of GLP-1, PPAR-γ, and 
insulin were increased while the levels of SGLT-2 and TNF-α were decreased with 
EMF treatment. Also, EMF recovered the histopathological changes in the liver, 
pancreas, and kidney in T2DM rats and protected pancreatic β-cells. 
Consequently, EMF is suggested as an unprecedented and promotive treatment 
approach for T2DM with a higher bioavailability and better antidiabetic effect 
compared to conventional dosage forms.

Comparison of subject-independent and subject-specific EEG-based BCI using LDA 
and SVM classifiers.

Dos Santos EM(1), San-Martin R(2), Fraga FJ(2).

Motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI) is one of the most used 
paradigms in EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI). The current 
state-of-the-art in BCI involves tuning classifiers to subject-specific training 
data, acquired over several sessions, in order to perform calibration prior to 
actual use of the so-called subject-specific BCI system (SS-BCI). Herein, the 
goal is to provide a ready-to-use system requiring minimal effort for setup. 
Thus, our challenge was to design a subject-independent BCI (SI-BCI) to be used 
by any new user without the constraint of individual calibration. Outcomes from 
other studies with the same purpose were used to undertake comparisons and 
validate our findings. For the EEG signal processing, we used a combination of 
the delta (0.5-4 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), and beta+gamma (13-40 Hz) bands at a 
stage prior to feature extraction. Next, we extracted features from the 
27-channel EEG using common spatial pattern (CSP) and performed binary 
classification (MI of right- and left-hand) with linear discriminant analysis 
(LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. These analyses were done for 
both the SS-BCI and SI-BCI models. We employed "leave-one-subject-out" (LOSO) 
arrangement and 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate our SI-BCI and SS-BCI 
systems, respectively. Compared with other two studies, our work was the only 
one that showed higher accuracy for the LDA classifier in SI-BCI as compared to 
SS-BCI. On the other hand, LDA accuracy was lower than accuracy achieved with 
SVM in both conditions (SI-BCI and SS-BCI). Our SS-BCI accuracy reached 76.85% 
using LDA and 94.20% using SVM and for SI-BCI we got 80.30% with LDA and 83.23% 
with SVM. We conclude that SI-BCI may be a feasible and relevant option, which 
can be used in scenarios where subjects are not able to submit themselves to 
long training sessions or to fast evaluation of the so called "BCI illiteracy." 
Comparatively, our strategy proved to be more efficient, giving us the best 
result for SI-BCI when faced against the classification performances of other 
three studies, even considering the caveat that different datasets were used in 
the comparison of the four studies.

Haptoglobin in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis.

Berntson L(#)(1), Palm J(2), Axling F(3), Zarelius P(2), Hellström PM(2), Webb 
DL(#)(4).

BACKGROUND: Haptoglobin (Hp), a liver derived acute phase inflammatory protein 
(APP), has scarcely been studied in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Hp can 
occur in blood as two isoforms (Hp1 and Hp2) in precursor and mature forms. 
Routine clinical chemistry immunoturbidimetry does not discern these forms. It 
is unknown how different forms relate to disease activity in JIA. Our aims were 
to determine allele frequency and plasma concentrations of different Hp forms at 
higher versus lower JIA disease activity and compare to other APPs.
METHODS: Plasma from JIA (n = 77) and healthy (n = 42) children were analyzed 
for apparent Hp allelic frequency and densitometric concentrations of alpha 
forms by Western blot (WB). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (buffy coat) was 
performed in a subset to estimate conformity with genetics. At higher versus 
lower juvenile arthritis disease activity score (JADAS27) (which includes 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)), total mature Hp concentration from WB was 
compared and correlated against immunoturbidimetry and total protein, albumin, 
serum amyloid A (SAA) and C-reactive protein (CRP).
RESULTS: At 300-fold dilution needed to study mature forms in Western blot, 
precursors were undetectable. Hp2 contributed most signal in most samples. Hp 
allele frequency was similar in JIA and controls. Both mature forms, taken 
separately or by sum, declined following treatment, but remained above 
concentrations of healthy controls, even in a remission subset that achieved 
JADAS27 < 1. Densitometry correlated with immunoturbidimetry. Hp concentrations 
correlated with JADAS27, albumin (negatively), CRP and SAA with 
immunoturbidimetric method correlating strongest to JADAS27 (Spearman R ~ 0.6, 
p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Hp allele frequency in JIA is similar to the general population, 
indicating that children with JIA should have the same possibility as in healthy 
children to produce preHp2 (zonulin), thought to increase intestinal 
permeability. Circulating Hp concentrations largely parallel other APPs and ESR; 
none of these measures correlate very strongly to JADAS27 score but Hp can be 
measured from capillary sampling which is impossible with ESR.

A new deuterium-labeled compound [2,3,4,6,6'-(2) H(5) ]-D-glucose for deuterium 
magnetic resonance metabolic imaging.

Deuterium (2 H) magnetic resonance imaging is an emerging approach for 
noninvasively studying glucose metabolism in vivo, which is important for 
understanding pathogenesis and monitoring the progression of many diseases such 
as tumors, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the synthesis of 2 
H-labeled glucose is costly because of the expensive raw substrates and the 
requirement for extreme reaction conditions, making the 2 H-labeled glucose 
rather expensive and unaffordable for clinic use. In this study, we present a 
new deuterated compound, [2,3,4,6,6'-2 H5 ]-D-glucose, with an approximate 
10-fold reduction in production costs. The synthesis route uses cheaper raw 
substrate methyl-α-D-glucopyranoside, relies on mild reaction conditions (80°C), 
and has higher deuterium labeling efficiency. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy 
(MRS) and mass spectroscopy experiments confirmed the successful deuterium 
labeling in the compound. Animal studies demonstrated that the substrate could 
describe the glycolytic metabolism in a glioma rat model by quantifying the 
downstream metabolites through 2 H-MRS on an ultrahigh field system. Comparison 
of the glucose metabolism characteristics was carried out between [2,3,4,6,6'-2 
H5 ]-D-glucose and commercial [6,6'-2 H2 ]-D-glucose in the animal studies. This 
cost-effective compound will help facilitate the clinical translation of 
deuterium magnetic resonance imaging, and enable this powerful metabolic imaging 
modality to be widely used in both preclinical and clinical research and 
applications.

Z(3), Tang Z(1), Xu N(1), Tao H(1), He X(1), Yu W(1), Zhang R(4), Huang R(3), Ni 
D(3), Yang X(3).

OBJECTIVES: Ultrasound (US) is important for diagnosing infant developmental 
dysplasia of the hip (DDH). However, the accuracy of the diagnosis depends 
heavily on expertise. We aimed to develop a novel automatic system (DDHnet) for 
accurate, fast, and robust diagnosis of DDH.
METHODS: An automatic system, DDHnet, was proposed to diagnose DDH by analyzing 
static ultrasound images. A five-fold cross-validation experiment was conducted 
using a dataset containing 881 patients to verify the performance of DDHnet. In 
addition, a blind test was conducted on 209 patients (158 normal and 51 abnormal 
cases). The feasibility and performance of DDHnet were investigated by embedding 
it into ultrasound machines at low computational cost.
RESULTS: DDHnet obtained reliable measurements and accurate diagnosis 
predictions. It reported an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) on α angle 
of 0.96 (95% CI: 0.93-0.97), β angle of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.95-0.98), FHC of 0.98 
(95% CI: 0.96-0.99) and PFD of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.90-0.96) in abnormal cases. 
DDHnet achieved a sensitivity of 90.56%, specificity of 100%, accuracy of 
98.64%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 100%, and negative predictive value 
(NPV) of 98.44% for the diagnosis of DDH. For the measurement task on the US 
device, DDHnet took only 1.1 seconds to operate and complete, whereas the 
experienced senior expert required an average 41.4 seconds.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed DDHnet demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for 
all four indicators of DDH diagnosis. Fast and highly accurate DDH diagnosis is 
achievable through DDHnet, and is accessible under constrained computational 
resources.

Competitive Non-Radical Nucleophilic Attack Pathways for NH(3) Oxidation and 
H(2) O Oxidation on Hematite Photoanodes.

Chen C(1)(2), Zhang Y(1)(2), Zhao J(1)(2).

The sluggish H2 O oxidation kinetics on photoanodes severely obstructs the 
overall solar-to-energy efficiency of photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells. Herein, 
we find a 10 to 55-fold increase of photocurrent by conducting ammonia oxidation 
reaction (AOR) on hematite (α-Fe2 O3 ) photoanodes under near-neutral pH (9-11) 
and moderate applied potentials (1.0-1.4 VRHE ) compared to H2 O oxidation. By 
rate law analysis and operando spectroscopic studies, we confirm the non-radical 
nucleophilic attack of NH3 molecules on high-valent surface Fe-O species (e.g., 
FeIV =O) and Fe-N species that produces NOx - and N2 , respectively, which 
overwhelms the nucleophilic attack of H2 O on surface FeIV =O and contributes to 
a high Faradaic efficiency of above 80 % for AOR. This work reveals a novel 
non-radical nucleophilic attack strategy, which is significantly different from 
the conventional indirect radical-mediated AOR mechanism, for the rational 
design of high-performance AOR photoelectrocatalysts.

HIV-associated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (HIV-TTP): A practical guide 
and review of the literature.

Louw S(1), Jacobson BF(1), Wiggill TM(1), Chapanduka Z(2), Sarah Mayne E(3).

BACKGROUND: Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), a serious thrombotic 
microangiopathy (TMA), is prevalent in the South African HIV-infected 
population. The exact pathogenesis of HIV-associated TTP (HIV-TTP) is however 
still unclear with diagnostic and therapeutic inconsistancies.
METHODS: A systematic review of the published literature regarding HIV-TTP was 
performed.
RESULTS: HIV-TTP is still associated with significant morbidity and mortality in 
Africa despite the availability of anti-retroviral therpy (ART). Diagnosis of 
HIV-TTP requires the presence of a micro-angiopathic haemolytic anaemia with 
significant red blood cell schistocytes and thrombocytopenia in the absence of 
another TMA but background activation of the coagulation system and inflammation 
in HIV infected people can result in diagnostic anbiguity. Plasma therapy in the 
form of infusion or exchange is successful but expensive, associated with 
side-effects and not widely available. Adjuvant immunosuppression therapy may of 
benefit in patients with HIV-TTP and ART must always be optimised. Endothelial 
dysfunction caused by chronic inflammation and complement activation most likely 
contributes to the development of HIV-TTP.
CONCLUSION: The role of adjuvant immunomodulating therpy, the therapeutic 
targets and pathogenic contribution from endothelial dysfunction in HIV-TTP 
requires further investigation.

Antidiabetic and Toxicological Effects of the Tea Infusion of Summer Collection 
from Annona cherimola Miller Leaves.

Martínez-Solís J(1)(2), Calzada F(2), Barbosa E(1), Gutiérrez-Meza JM(1).

Annona cherimola Miller (Ac) is a plant used in Mexican traditional medicine for 
the treatment of diabetes. In this work, the tea infusion extracts obtained from 
1.5 g of leaf powder from Ac collected in May (AcMa), June (AcJun), July 
(AcJul), and August (AcAu) were evaluated on streptozocin-induced diabetic 
(STID) mice and for subchronic toxicity in STID and non-diabetic (ND) mice. In 
addition, extracts were subjected to high-performance liquid chromatography with 
diode array detection (HPLC-DAD). Results showed that the tea infusion extract 
of the sample collected in August (AcAu) exhibited the most significant 
antihyperglycemic activity during all acute assays. The analysis of the extracts 
(AcMa, AcJu, AcJul, and AcAu) by HPLC-DAD revealed that flavonoid glycosides, 
rutin, narcissin, and nicotiflorin were the major components. In addition, the 
sample AcAu contained the best concentration of flavonoids. In the case of 
subchronic oral toxicity, the AcAu sample did not cause mortality in STID mice, 
and histopathological analysis revealed significant improvement in the changes 
associated with diabetes in the liver and kidneys. These findings suggest that 
the Ac leaves collected in August may be a source of flavonoids such as rutin, 
with antidiabetic potential. In addition, these findings support the use of Ac 
to treat diabetes in traditional medicine.

Personalized genome sequencing has revealed millions of genetic differences 
between individuals, but our understanding of their clinical relevance remains 
largely incomplete. To systematically decipher the effects of human genetic 
variants, we obtained whole genome sequencing data for 809 individuals from 233 
primate species, and identified 4.3 million common protein-altering variants 
with orthologs in human. We show that these variants can be inferred to have 
non-deleterious effects in human based on their presence at high allele 
frequencies in other primate populations. We use this resource to classify 6% of 
all possible human protein-altering variants as likely benign and impute the 
pathogenicity of the remaining 94% of variants with deep learning, achieving 
state-of-the-art accuracy for diagnosing pathogenic variants in patients with 
genetic diseases.
ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY: Deep learning classifier trained on 4.3 million common 
primate missense variants predicts variant pathogenicity in humans.

Polymorphism in autophagy-related genes LRP1 and CAPZA1 may promote gastric 
mucosal atrophy.

BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori secretes cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) into 
the gastric epithelium, causing gastric mucosal atrophy (GMA) and gastric 
cancer. In contrast, host cells degrade CagA via autophagy. However, the 
association between polymorphisms in autophagy-related genes and GMA must be 
fully elucidated.
RESULTS: We evaluated the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) in autophagy-related genes (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related 
protein 1, LRP1; capping actin protein of muscle Z-line alpha subunit 1, CAPAZ1; 
and lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1, LAMP1) and GMA in 200 H. 
pylori-positive individuals. The frequency of the T/T genotype at rs1800137 in 
LRP1 was significantly lower in the GMA group than in the non-GMA group 
(p = 0.018, odds ratio [OR] = 0.188). The frequencies of the G/A or A/A genotype 
at rs4423118 and T/A or A/A genotype at rs58618380 of CAPAZ1 in the GMA group 
were significantly higher than those in the non-GMA group (p = 0.029 and 
p = 0.027, respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed that C/C or C/T 
genotype at rs1800137, T/A or A/A genotype at rs58618380, and age were 
independent risk factors for GMA (p = 0.038, p = 0.023, and p = 0.006, 
respectively). Furthermore, individuals with the rs1800137 C/C or C/T genotype 
of LRP1 had a 5.3-fold higher susceptibility to GMA. These genetic tests may 
provide future directions for precision medicine for individuals more likely to 
develop GMA.
CONCLUSION: LRP1 and CAPZA1 polymorphisms may be associated with the development 
of GMA.

Modular polyketide synthases (PKSs) are polymerases that employ 
α-carboxyacyl-CoAs as extender substrates. This enzyme family contains several 
catalytic modules, where each module is responsible for a single round of 
polyketide chain extension. Although PKS modules typically use malonyl-CoA or 
methylmalonyl-CoA for chain elongation, many other malonyl-CoA analogues are 
used to diversify polyketide structures in nature. Previously, we developed a 
method to alter an extension substrate of a given module by exchanging an 
acyltransferase (AT) domain while maintaining protein folding. Here, we report 
in vitro polyketide biosynthesis by 13 PKSs (the wild-type PKS and 12 
AT-exchanged PKSs with unusual ATs) and 14 extender substrates. Our ∼200 in 
vitro reactions resulted in 13 structurally different polyketides, including 
several polyketides that have not been reported. In some cases, AT-exchanged 
PKSs produced target polyketides by >100-fold compared to the wild-type PKS. 
These data also indicate that most unusual AT domains do not incorporate 
malonyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA but incorporate various rare extender 
substrates that are equal to in size or slightly larger than natural substrates. 
We developed a computational workflow to predict the approximate AT substrate 
range based on active site volumes to support the selection of ATs. These 
results greatly enhance our understanding of rare AT domains and demonstrate the 
benefit of using the proposed PKS engineering strategy to produce novel 
chemicals in vitro.

Laparoscopic Management of Disseminated Peritoneal Leiomyomatosis.

Kriplani I(1), Kriplani A(2), Sharma S(2), Sodhi M(2), Jain N(2).

STUDY OBJECTIVE: To show laparoscopic management of disseminated peritoneal 
leiomyomatosis (DPL).
DESIGN: Stepwise demonstration of the technique with narrated video footage.
SETTING: DPL is characterized by dissemination and proliferation of peritoneal 
and subperitoneal lesions primarily originating from smooth muscle cells [1]. 
Generally considered benign, cases of malignant transformation to leiomyosarcoma 
have been reported [2,3]. Iatrogenic DPL occurs because of unconfined 
morcellation resulting in small fragments of myoma that may implant on any organ 
and start deriving blood supply from it or may be pulled into port site while 
withdrawing laparoscopic cannulas [4]. It is estimated that the overall 
incidence of DPL after laparoscopic uncontained morcellation was 0.12% to 
0.95% [5]. Mainstay of treatment is surgical resection of myomas and regular 
follow-up with imaging. A 28-year-old unmarried girl presented with complain of 
lump abdomen increasing in size for 1 year. She also complained of a 15 kg 
weight loss in the last 1 year; 4 years ago, patient had undergone laparoscopic 
myomectomy with unconfined morcellation for a 10 × 8 cm cervical myoma. 
Presently her menses were regular with a 28-day cycle and 3 to 4 days' average 
flow. Magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple nodular lesions of varying 
sizes in relation to small bowel, colon, uterus, and anterior abdominal wall 
 suggestive of DPL. Bilateral ovaries were normal. Tumor markers were as 
follows: CA 125 23.2 (<35) U/mL Carcinoembryonic antigen 1.67 (<8) ng/mL CA 19-9 
47 (<37) U/mL Lactate dehydrogenase 809 (180-360) IU/L Alpha-fetoprotein 2.03 
(<10) ng/mL Beta human chorionic gonadotropin 1.2(<2) mIU/mL Tru-cut biopsy was 
done elsewhere to rule out peritoneal carcinomatosis in view of raised CA 19-9 
and lactate dehydrogenase, history of weight loss, and imaging showing multiple 
abdominal masses. Histopathological examination showed leiomyomatosis and 
immunohistochemistry for smooth muscle actin, desmin, and vimentin were 
positive.
INTERVENTIONS: On laparoscopy the abdominal cavity was found studded with 
multiple leiomyomas of varying sizes deriving blood supply from ilium, 
transverse, descending and sigmoid colon, rectum, left tube, left ovary, pouch 
of Douglas, bilateral uterosacrals, uterovesical fold, and anterior abdominal 
wall. Large blood vessels were seen traversing between the descending and 
sigmoid colon and the myomas. Principles of surgery were as follows: 1. Complete 
removal of myomas 2. Cauterization of blood vessels feeding the parasitic myomas 
to minimize blood loss 3. Disscetion abutting the myoma to prevent injury to 
adjacent viscera. A total of 26 myomas were removed. All the myomas were 
retrieved by morcellation in a bag. Histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of 
diffuse peritoneal leiomyomatosis. Follow-up ultrasound at 6 months showed no 
recurrence of leiomyomatosis.
CONCLUSION: Proper mapping of lesions and surgery for complete removal of all 
masses is the mainstay of treatment. Contained morcellation in bag should be the 
norm to prevent iatrogenic DPL. Regular follow-up with imaging is required to 
rule out recurrence.

Information-Rich, Dual-Function (13)C/(2)H-Isotopic Crosstalk NMR Assay for 
Human Serine Racemase (hSR) Provides a PLP-Enzyme "Partitioning Fingerprint" and 
Reveals Disparate Chemotypes for hSR Inhibition.

Ramos de Dios SM(1), Hass JL(1), Graham DL(1), Kumar N(1), Antony AE(1), Morton 
MD(1), Berkowitz DB(1).

The first dual-function assay for human serine racemase (hSR), the only bona 
fide racemase in human biology, is reported. The hSR racemization function is 
essential for neuronal signaling, as the product, d-serine (d-Ser), is a potent 
N-methyl d-aspartate (NMDA) coagonist, important for learning and memory, with 
dysfunctional d-Ser-signaling being observed in some neuronal disorders. The 
second hSR function is β-elimination and gives pyruvate; this activity is 
elevated in colorectal cancer. This new NMR-based assay allows one to monitor 
both α-proton-exchange chemistry and β-elimination using only the native l-Ser 
substrate and hSR and is the most sensitive such assay. The assay judiciously 
employs segregated dual 13C-labeling and 13C/2H crosstalk, exploiting both the 
splitting and shielding effects of deuterium. The assay is deployed to screen a 
1020-compound library and identifies an indolo-chroman-2,4-dione inhibitor 
family that displays allosteric site binding behavior (noncompetitive inhibition 
vs l-Ser substrate; competitive inhibition vs adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP)). 
This assay also reveals important mechanistic information for hSR; namely, that 
H/D exchange is ∼13-fold faster than racemization, implying that K56 protonates 
the carbanionic intermediate on the si-face much faster than does S84 on the 
re-face. Moreover, the 13C NMR peak pattern seen is suggestive of internal 
return, pointing to K56 as the likely enamine-protonating residue for 
β-elimination. The 13C/2H-isotopic crosstalk assay has also been applied to the 
enzyme tryptophan synthase and reveals a dramatically different partition ratio 
in this active site (β-replacement: si-face protonation ∼6:1 vs β-elimination: 
si-face protonation ∼1:3.6 for hSR), highlighting the value of this approach for 
fingerprinting the pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) enzyme mechanism.

Intracellular autolytic whole cell Salmonella vaccine prevents colonization of 
pathogenic Salmonella Typhimurium in chicken.

Peng M(1), Joo J(1), Alvarado-Martinez Z(2), Tabashsum Z(3), Aditya A(4), Biswas 
D(5).

Salmonella enterica (SE) is a major foodborne bacterial pathogen in the United 
States, commonly found as the normal flora of various animals that is attributed 
to causing at least 1.2 million infections annually. Poultry plays a major role 
in disseminating SE through direct contact with live animals and consumption of 
contaminated products. Vaccinating poultry against SE is a sustainable approach 
that can reduce SE in the host, preventing future infections in humans. An 
intracellular autolytic SE serovar Typhimurium vaccine (STLT2+P13+19) was 
developed by integrating genes 13 (holin) and 19 (lysozyme) of bacteriophage P22 
into the bacterial chromosome. These were inserted downstream of sseA, an SPI-2 
chaperone in SE that expresses during the intracellular phase of SE. 
Intracellular viability of STLT2+P13+19 reduced by 94.42% at 24 hr compared to 
the wild type in chicken macrophage cells (HD-11), whereas growth rate and 
adhesion ability remained unchanged. Inoculating STLT2+P13+19 in HD-11 
significantly enhanced the relative log fold expression of genes associated to 
production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 p40, 
IL-18, and GM-CSF) and Toll-like-receptors (TRL-3 and 7). Vaccination of an in 
vivo chicken model demonstrated significant changes in secretion of iNOS, IL-6, 
IL-8, IL-12, and TNF-α, as well as a reduction in the intestinal colonization of 
SE serovar Typhimurium. Microbiome analysis of cecal fluid using 16S rRNA gene 
sequencing also showed modulation of intestinal microbial composition, 
specifically a decrease in relative abundance of Proteobacteria and increasing 
Firmicutes. This study provides insight into a novel vaccine design that could 
make food products safer without the use of synthetic compounds.

Structural basis for the dual catalytic activity of the Legionella pneumophila 
ovarian tumor (OTU) domain deubiquitinase LotA.

Luo J(1), Ruan X(2), Huang Z(1), Li Z(1), Ye L(1), Wu Y(1), Zhen X(3), Ouyang 
S(4).

Legionella pneumophila, a bacterial pathogen that causes a severe pneumonia 
known as Legionnaires' disease, extensively exploits the ubiquitin (Ub) pathway 
in the infected host cells through certain virulence effectors excreted by the 
Dot/Icm system. To date, several Dot/Icm effectors have been found to act as Ub 
ligases, and four effectors, including LotA, LotB, LotC, and Ceg7, have been 
identified as deubiquitinases (DUBs) from the ovarian tumor (OTU) domain family. 
LotA is unique among other OTU DUBs because it possesses two distinct DUB 
domains and exclusively exhibits catalytic activity against K6-linked diUb and 
polyUb chains. However, the structure of LotA and the molecular mechanism for 
the dual DUB activity remains elusive. In this study, we solved the structure of 
LotA in complex with proximally bound Ub and distal covalently bound Ub. Both Ub 
molecules are bound to the DUB1 domain and mimic a K6-linked diUb. Structural 
analysis reveals that the DUB1 domain utilizes a distinct mechanism for 
recognition of the K6-linked diUb within a large S1' binding site that is 
uncommon to OTU DUBs. Structural fold of the LotA DUB2 domain closely resembles 
LotB and LotC, similarly containing an extra α-helix lobe that has been 
demonstrated to play an important role in Ub binding. Collectively, our study 
uncovers the structural basis for the dual catalytic activity of the unique OTU 
family DUB LotA.

Succinate based polymers drive immunometabolism in dendritic cells to generate 
cancer immunotherapy.

HS(4), Rubino TE Jr(5), Shi X(6), Loa ST(7), Yaron JR(2), Hitosugi T(7), Green

Boosting the metabolism of immune cells while restricting cancer cell metabolism 
is challenging. Herein, we report that using biomaterials for the controlled 
delivery of succinate metabolite to phagocytic immune cells activates them and 
modulates their metabolism in the presence of metabolic inhibitors. In young 
immunocompetent mice, polymeric microparticles, with succinate incorporated in 
the backbone, induced strong pro-inflammatory anti-melanoma responses. 
Administration of poly(ethylene succinate) (PES MP)-based vaccines and 
glutaminase inhibitor to young immunocompetent mice with aggressive and large, 
established B16F10 melanoma tumors increased their survival three-fold, a result 
of increased cytotoxic T cells expressing RORγT (Tc17). Mechanistically, PES MPs 
directly modulate glutamine and glutamate metabolism, upregulate succinate 
receptor SUCNR1, activate antigen presenting cells through and HIF-1alpha, TNFa 
and TSLP-signaling pathways, and are dependent on alpha-ketoglutarate 
dehydrogenase for their activity, which demonstrates correlation of succinate 
delivery and these pathways. Overall, our findings suggest that 
immunometabolism-modifying PES MP strategies provide an approach for developing 
robust cancer immunotherapies.

S(4), Zhang X(5).

Interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase-4 (IRAK4) has emerged as a therapeutic 
target for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Through reversing the amide of 
CA-4948 and computer aided structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies, a 
series of IRAK4 inhibitors with oxazolo[4,5-b]pyridine scaffold were identified. 
Compound 32 showed improved potency (IC50 = 43 nM) compared to CA-4948 
(IC50 = 115 nM), but suffered from hERG inhibition (IC50 = 5.7 μM). Further 
optimization led to compound 42 with reduced inhibition of hERG (IC50 > 30 μM) 
and 13-fold higher activity (IC50 = 8.9 nM) than CA-4948. Importantly, compound 
42 had favorable in vitro ADME and in vivo pharmacokinetic properties. 
Furthermore, compound 42 significantly reduced LPS-induced production of serum 
TNF-α and IL-6 cytokines in the mouse model. The overall profiles of compound 42 
support it as a lead for the development of IRAK4 inhibitors for the treatment 
of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders.

Designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins provide insights into the structure and 
function of CagI and are potent inhibitors of CagA translocation by the 
Helicobacter pylori type IV secretion system.

The bacterial human pathogen Helicobacter pylori produces a type IV secretion 
system (cagT4SS) to inject the oncoprotein CagA into gastric cells. The cagT4SS 
external pilus mediates attachment of the apparatus to the target cell and the 
delivery of CagA. While the composition of the pilus is unclear, CagI is present 
at the surface of the bacterium and required for pilus formation. Here, we have 
investigated the properties of CagI by an integrative structural biology 
approach. Using Alpha Fold 2 and Small Angle X-ray scattering, it was found that 
CagI forms elongated dimers mediated by rod-shape N-terminal domains (CagIN) 
prolonged by globular C-terminal domains (CagIC). Three Designed Ankyrin Repeat 
Proteins (DARPins) K2, K5 and K8 selected against CagI interacted with CagIC 
with subnanomolar affinities. The crystal structures of the CagI:K2 and CagI:K5 
complexes were solved and identified the interfaces between the molecules, 
thereby providing a structural explanation for the difference in affinity 
between the two binders. Purified CagI and CagIC were found to interact with 
adenocarcinoma gastric (AGS) cells, induced cell spreading and the interaction 
was inhibited by K2. The same DARPin inhibited CagA translocation by up to 65% 
in AGS cells while inhibition levels were 40% and 30% with K8 and K5, 
respectively. Our study suggests that CagIC plays a key role in cagT4SS-mediated 
CagA translocation and that DARPins targeting CagI represent potent inhibitors 
of the cagT4SS, a crucial risk factor for gastric cancer development.

Surface Ligand Engineering Ruthenium Nanozyme Superior to Horseradish Peroxidase 
for Enhanced Immunoassay.

Fan H(1), Zheng J(2), Xie J(1), Liu J(3), Gao X(2), Yan X(1)(4)(5), Fan 
K(1)(4)(5), Gao L(1)(4).

Nanozymes have great potential to be used as an alternative to natural enzymes 
in a variety of fields. However, low catalytic activity compared with natural 
enzymes limits their practical use. It is still challenging to design nanozymes 
comparable to their natural counterparts in terms of the specific activity. In 
this study, a surface engineering strategy is employed to improve the specific 
activity of Ru nanozymes using charge-transferrable ligands such as polystyrene 
sulfonate (PSS). PSS-modified Ru nanozyme exhibits a peroxidase-like specific 
activity of up to 2820 U mg-1 , which is twice that of horseradish peroxidase 
(1305 U mg-1 ). Mechanism studies suggest that PSS readily accepts negative 
charge from Ru, thus reducing the affinity between Ru and ·OH. Importantly, the 
modified Ru-peroxidase nanozyme is successfully used to develop an immunoassay 
for human alpha-fetoprotein and achieves a 140-fold increase in detection 
sensitivity compared with traditional horseradish-peroxidase-based enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay. Therefore, this work provides a feasible route to design 
nanozymes with high specific activity that meets the practical use as an 
alternative to natural enzymes.

    Aliment Pharmacol Ther. 2022 Oct;56(7):1207-1208.

BACKGROUND: The global prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is 
increasing. However, population-level data are scarce for Asian populations.
AIMS: To outline and compare paediatric and adult IBD incidence and prevalence 
data in Korea, describe prescription patterns, and analyse outcomes of 
anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) use in a nationally representative cohort 
METHODS: IBD was identified based on the presence of Rare and Intractable 
Disease diagnosis codes for Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). We 
calculated age-based prevalence and incidence, and examined prescription 
patterns. We used a Cox proportional hazard model to calculate the hazard ratio 
(HR) for undergoing surgery.
RESULTS: The prevalence of CD increased between 2006 and 2015, particularly 
among those aged 10-19 years (12.7-35.5 patients per 100,000 people). The use of 
anti-TNF agents increased from 3.2% to 22.9% in paediatric CD patients. Early 
use of an anti-TNF agent increased 25-fold in CD patients. Further, CD patients 
aged 0-14 years were most likely to undergo fistulectomy (HR, 2.63; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 1.73-3.97). Children with UC had a higher risk of 
undergoing surgery (HR, 3.01; 95% CI, 1.33-6.83) than adults. Early use of an 
anti-TNF agent in CD patients was associated with lower odds of surgery than 
late-stage use.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of IBD has increased over time, especially among 
paediatric patients. Given the magnitude of paediatric IBD disease burden, a 
multi-faceted approach is needed for early detection and vigilant monitoring to 
aim for better prognosis.

Combined toxicity of air pollutants related to e-waste on inflammatory cytokines 
linked with neurotransmitters and pediatric behavioral problems.

Zeng X(1), Xu C(2), Xu X(3), Huang Y(2), Wang Q(1), Huo X(4).

E-waste usually refers to the discarded electrical or electronic equipment that 
is no longer used. Informal e-waste recycling methods, such as burning, 
roasting, acid leaching, and shredding, had resulted in serious air pollution, 
which is a prominent risk factor for children's health. However, the combined 
toxicity of air pollutants on children's behavioral health remains unclear. This 
study collected data on air pollution exposure, calculated the average daily 
dose (ADD) based on these air pollutants for children in Guiyu (e-waste group, 
n = 112) and Haojiang (reference group, n = 101), then assessed children's 
behavioral health using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and 
further estimated the associations of ADD, inflammatory cytokines, 
neurotransmitters, and children's behavioral problems. Compared with Haojiang, 
Guiyu has poorer air quality and higher levels of ADD, inflammatory cytokines 
(such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α), neurotransmitters (such as DA and SP), and SDQ 
scores, but lower levels of serum neuropeptide Y (NPY) levels. Spearman 
correlation analyses indicated that there were significant relationships among 
inflammatory cytokines, neurotransmitters, and behavioral scores. Multiple 
linear regression analyses showed that each unit increase in ADD was associated 
with serum levels of DA and SP, the serum NPY subsequently changed by B (95% 
CI): 0.99 (0.14, 1.84) nmol/L, 0.25 (0.08, 0.42) ng/mL, and - 0.16 (-0.26, 
-0.05) ng/mL, respectively. After adjustment for confounders, logistic 
regression analyses suggested that with each one-fold increase in ADD was 
associated with the risk of emotional symptoms [OR (95% CI): 18.15 (2.72, 
121.06)], hyperactivity-inattention [13.64 (2.28, 81.65)] and total difficulties 
[8.90 (1.60, 49.35)] and prosocial behavior [- 7.32 (-44.37, -1.21)]. Taken 
together, this study demonstrates that combined exposure to air pollutants may 
alter the levels of inflammatory cytokines and serum neurotransmitter to 
subsequently impact behavioral health in children.

Update of
    bioRxiv. 2023 Feb 17;:

Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of ischemic stroke, which is a leading cause of 
death and long-term disability. Understanding the exact cellular signaling 
pathways that initiate and propagate neuroinflammation after stroke will be 
critical for developing immunomodulatory stroke therapies. In particular, the 
precise mechanisms of inflammatory signaling in the clinically relevant 
hyperacute period, hours after stroke, have not been elucidated. We used the 
RiboTag technique to obtain microglia and astrocyte-derived mRNA transcripts in 
a hyperacute (4 h) and acute (3 days) period after stroke, as these two cell 
types are key modulators of acute neuroinflammation. Microglia initiated a rapid 
response to stroke at 4 h by adopting an inflammatory profile associated with 
the recruitment of immune cells. The hyperacute astrocyte profile was marked by 
stress response genes and transcription factors, such as Fos and Jun, involved 
in pro-inflammatory pathways such as TNF-α. By 3 days, microglia shift to a 
proliferative state and astrocytes strengthen their inflammatory response. The 
astrocyte pro-inflammatory response at 3 days is partially driven by the 
upregulation of the transcription factors C/EBPβ, Spi1, and Rel, which comprise 
25% of upregulated transcription factor-target interactions. Surprisingly, few 
sex differences across all groups were observed. Expression and log2 fold data 
for all sequenced genes are available on a user-friendly website for researchers 
to examine gene changes and generate hypotheses for stroke targets. Taken 
together, our data comprehensively describe the microglia and astrocyte-specific 
translatome response in the hyperacute and acute period after stroke and 
identify pathways critical for initiating neuroinflammation.

Recognize enhanced temporal-spatial-spectral features with a parallel 
multi-branch CNN and GRU.

Wang L(1), Li M(2)(3)(4), Zhang L(5).

Deep learning has been applied to the recognition of motor imagery 
electroencephalograms (MI-EEG) in brain-computer interface, and the performance 
results depend on data representation as well as neural network structure. 
Especially, MI-EEG is so complex with the characteristics of non-stationarity, 
specific rhythms, and uneven distribution; however, its multidimensional feature 
information is difficult to be fused and enhanced simultaneously in the existing 
recognition methods. In this paper, a novel channel importance (NCI) based on 
time-frequency analysis is proposed to develop an image sequence generation 
method (NCI-ISG) for enhancing the integrity of data representation and 
highlighting the contribution inequalities of different channels as well. Each 
electrode of MI-EEG is converted to a time-frequency spectrum by utilizing 
short-time Fourier transform; the corresponding part to 8-30 Hz is combined with 
random forest algorithm for computing NCI; and it is further divided into three 
sub-images covered by α (8-13 Hz), β1 (13-21 Hz), and β2 (21-30 Hz) bands; their 
spectral powers are further weighted by NCI and interpolated to 2-dimensional 
electrode coordinates, producing three main sub-band image sequences. Then, a 
parallel multi-branch convolutional neural network and gate recurrent unit 
(PMBCG) is designed to successively extract and identify the spatial-spectral 
and temporal features from the image sequences. Two public four-class MI-EEG 
datasets are adopted; the proposed classification method respectively achieves 
the average accuracies of 98.26% and 80.62% by 10-fold cross-validation 
experiment; and its statistical performance is also evaluated by multi-indexes, 
such as Kappa value, confusion matrix, and ROC curve. Extensive experiment 
results show that NCI-ISG + PMBCG can yield great performance on MI-EEG 
classification compared to state-of-the-art methods. The proposed NCI-ISG can 
enhance the feature representation of time-frequency-space domains and match 
well with PMBCG, which improves the recognition accuracies of MI tasks and 
demonstrates the preferable reliability and distinguishable ability. This paper 
proposes a novel channel importance (NCI) based on time-frequency analysis to 
develop an image sequences generation method (NCI-ISG) for enhancing the 
integrity of data representation and highlighting the contribution inequalities 
of different channels as well. Then, a parallel multi-branch convolutional 
neural network and gate recurrent unit (PMBCG) is designed to successively 
extract and identify the spatial-spectral and temporal features from the image 
sequences.

NK cells are major effector cells involved in the elimination of early tumors 
and prevent metastasis. They often have an impaired function in patients with 
cancer. Preclinical studies have demonstrated NK cell activation as the 
adjunctive effect of invariant NKT (iNKT) cells. Activation of iNKT cells after 
administration of the glycolipid ligand α-galactosylceramide, loaded with 
CD1d-expressing human PBMC-derived APCs (APC/Gal), is an attractive cancer 
therapy to optimize the use of NK cells. However, the subsets of NK cells that 
are activated following iNKT cell activation as well as the period of NK cell 
activation remain unclear. In this study, we report that the granzyme 
B-expressing NK cell response in postoperative lung cancer patients was enhanced 
49 d after administration of APC/Gal in a phase II study. We found maximum IFN-γ 
production on day 49 in 13 out of 27 APC/Gal-treated patients. On day 49, 14 out 
of 27 patients (51.9%) had higher IFN-γ production by iNKT cells (>6-fold higher 
than the baseline level). This increment significantly correlated with granzyme 
B-expressing NK cells. Although IFN-γ production was lower in patients in the 
nontreated group, we detected maximum IFN-γ production 12 mo after the resection 
of lung cancer (9 out of 29 patients [31%]). These findings suggest that 
elimination of cancer cells leads to increased NK cell function, which can be 
further enhanced by APC/Gal therapy.

INTRODUCTION: Radix Notoginseng, one of the most famous Chinese traditional 
medicines, is the dried root of Panax notoginseng (Araliaceae). Stems and leaves 
of P. notoginseng (SLPN) are rich in secondary metabolites and nutrients, and 
authorized as a food resource, however, its utilization needs further research.
METHODS: A SLPN-instant beverage was manufactured from SLPN through optimization 
by response surface design with 21-fold of 48.50% ethanol for 39 h, and this 
extraction was repeated twice; the extraction solution was concentrated to 1/3 
volume using a vacuum rotatory evaporator at 45°C, and then spray dried at 
110°C. Nutritional components including 14 amino acids, ten mineral elements, 15 
vitamins were detected in the SLPN-instant beverage; forty-three triterpenoid 
saponins, e.g., ginsenoside La, ginsenoside Rb3, notoginsenoside R1, and two 
flavonoid glycosides, as well as dencichine were identified by UPLC-MS.
RESULTS: The extraction rate of SLPN-instant beverage was 37.89 ± 0.02%. The 
majority nutrients were Gly (2.10 ± 0.63 mg/g), His (1.23 ± 0.07 mg/g), α-VE 
(18.89 ± 1.87 μg/g), β-VE (17.53 ± 1.98 μg/g), potassium (49.26 ± 2.70 mg/g), 
calcium (6.73 ± 0.27 mg/g). The total saponin of the SLPN-instant beverage was 
403.05 ± 34.98 mg/g, majority was notoginsenoside Fd and with contents of 227 ± 
2.02 mg/g. In addition, catechin and γ-aminobutyric acid were detected with 
levels of 24.57 ± 0.21 mg/g and 7.50 ± 1.85 mg/g, respectively. The SLPN-instant 
beverage showed good antioxidant activities with half maximal inhibitory 
concentration (IC50) for scavenging hydroxyl (OH-) radicals, superoxide anion 
(O2-) radicals, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals and 
2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS+) radicals were 0.1954, 
0.2314, 0.4083, and 0.3874 mg/mL, respectively.
CONCLUSION: We optimized an analytical method for in depth analysis of the newly 
authorized food resource SLPN. Together, an instant beverage with antioxidant 
activity, rich in nutrients and secondary metabolites, was manufactured from 
SLPN, which may improve the utilization of SLPN.

    Radiat Oncol. 2023 Mar 15;18(1):53.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to develop a normal tissue complication 
probability model using a machine learning approach (ML-based NTCP) to predict 
the risk of radiation-induced liver disease in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population included 201 HCC patients treated 
with radiotherapy. The patients' medical records were retrospectively reviewed 
to obtain the clinical and radiotherapy data. Toxicity was defined by 
albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade increase. The normal liver dose-volume histogram 
was reduced to mean liver dose (MLD) based on the fraction size-adjusted 
equivalent uniform dose (2 Gy/fraction and α/β = 2). Three types of ML-based 
classification models were used, a penalized logistic regression (PLR), random 
forest (RF), and gradient-boosted tree (GBT) model. Model performance was 
compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
(AUROC). Internal validation was performed by 5-fold cross validation and 
external validation was done in 44 new patients.
RESULTS: Liver toxicity occurred in 87 patients (43.1%). The best individual 
model was the GBT model using baseline liver function, liver volume, and MLD as 
inputs and the best overall model was an ensemble of the PLR and GBT models. An 
AUROC of 0.82 with a standard deviation of 0.06 was achieved for the internal 
validation. An AUROC of 0.78 with a standard deviation of 0.03 was achieved for 
the external validation. The behaviors of the best GBT model were also in good 
agreement with the domain knowledge on NTCP.
CONCLUSION: We propose the methodology to develop an ML-based NTCP model to 
estimate the risk of ALBI grade increase.

SM(1), Vijayaraghavan R(1), Jagdish R(1), Kumar M(1), Kumar G(5), Mondot S(6), 
Dore J(6), Sarin SK(#)(7).

BACKGROUND: Severe alcoholic hepatitis (SAH) has high 90-day mortality. 
Prednisolone therapy has shown modest survival benefits over placebo at 28 but 
not 90 days. Fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) has shown promise in these 
patients. We compared the efficacy and safety of the two therapies in SAH 
patients.
METHODS: Steroid eligible SAH patients were randomized in an open-label study to 
prednisolone (n = 60) 40 mg/day for 28 days (assessed at day-7 for continuation) 
or healthy donor FMT (n = 60) through naso-duodenal tube, daily for seven days. 
Primary outcome of study was day-90 survival.
RESULTS: Patients in prednisolone and FMT arms were comparable at baseline 
(discriminant function score 65 ± 16.2 and 68 ± 14, MELD score 17.1 and 16.5, 
respectively). Of 120 patients, 112 [prednisolone-57; FMT-55] completed trial. 
As per intention-to-treat analysis, 90-day survival was achieved by 56.6% 
(34/60) patients in prednisolone and 75% (45/60) in FMT group (p = 0.044, FMT 
HR = 0.528, 95%CI 0.279-0.998). Secondary outcome of 28-day survival [78.33% 
(47/60) and 88.33% (53/60) (p = 0.243, FMT HR = 0.535, 95%CI 0.213-1.34)] with 
comparable severity scores over time between both arms. Infections accounted for 
11 (19.3%) and 2 (3.6%) deaths in prednisolone and FMT groups, respectively 
(p = 0.01). Path-tracing showed a slow establishment of microbiota and alpha 
diversity (Shannon index) improvement by day-28 (p = 0.029). FMT resulted in 23 
new taxa by day-28, reduction from baseline in pathogenic taxa [Campylobacter 
(19-fold, p = 0.035), anaerobes (Parcubacteria, Weisella and Leuconostocaceae)], 
and increase of Alphaproteobacteria [~ sevenfold, p = 0.047] and Thaumarcheota 
(known ammonia oxidizer, p = 0.06). Lachnospiraceae (p = 0.008), Prevotella and 
Viellonella communities in gut favored survival (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: In severe alcoholic hepatitis, FMT is safe and improves 90-day 
survival and reduces infections by favorably modulating microbial communities. 
It can be a useful alternative to prednisolone therapy.

Amelogenesis imperfecta in a Chinese family resulting from a FAM83H variation 
and the effect of FAM83H on the secretion of enamel matrix proteins.

Xie Y(#)(1), Meng M(#)(1), Cao L(2), Yang J(2), Ma Q(1), Huang X(1), Yu Y(1), 
Yang Q(1), Zou J(3), Du Q(4).

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the variant of an amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) family 
and to explore the function of the FAM83H (family with sequence similarity 83 
member H) in the enamel formation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated a five-generation Chinese family 
diagnosed with AI; clinical data was collected, whole-exome sequencing (WES) was 
conducted to explore the pathogenic gene and variants and Sanger sequencing was 
used to verify the variants. The three-dimensional protein structures of 
wild-type and mutant FAM83H were predicted using alpha fold 2. To study the 
possible regulatory function of Fam83h on amelogenesis, immunolocalization was 
performed to observe the expression of Fam83h protein in Sprague-Dawley rat 
postnatal incisors. The mRNA and protein level of amelogenin, enamelin, 
kallikrein-related peptidase-4 and ameloblastin were also detected after the 
Fam83h was knocked down by small interfering RNA (siRNA) in HAT-7 cells.
RESULTS: A known nonsense variant (c.973 C > T) in exon 5 of FAM83H gene was 
found in this family, causing a truncated protein (p.R325X). Immunolocalization 
of Fam83h in Sprague-Dawley rat postnatal incisors showed that Fam83h protein 
expression was detected in presecretory and secretory stages. When Fam83h 
expression was reduced by siRNA, the expression of amelogenin, enamelin, 
kallikrein-related peptidase-4 decreased. However, the expression of 
ameloblastin increased.
CONCLUSIONS: FAM83H gene variant (c.973 C > T) causes AI. FAM83H regulates the 
secretion of enamel matrix proteins and affects ameloblast differentiation.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study provided that FAM83H variants could influence 
enamel formation and provided new insights into the pathogenesis of AI.

Usnic Acid-Loaded Polymeric Micelles: An Optimal Migrastatic-Acting Formulation 
in Human SH-SY5Y Neuroblastoma Cells.

Vasarri M(1), Ponti L(2), Degl'Innocenti D(1), Bergonzi MC(2).

Usnic acid (UA) is one of the most abundant and common metabolites of lichens, 
known for its numerous pharmacological properties. Nevertheless, it presents 
some criticalities that severely limit its use in therapy: poor solubility in 
water and significant hepatotoxicity. Soluplus and Solutol HS15 and 
D-α-Tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) were employed to 
develop polymeric micelles (UA-PM). The chemical and physical properties of the 
system were characterized, including the size, homogeneity, zeta potential, 
critical micellar concentration (CMC), encapsulation efficiency (EE%), and in 
vitro release. The freeze-drying process was considered to prevent agglomeration 
and improve the stability of the formulation. The stability of the micelles and 
the freeze-dried product (UA-PML) was also evaluated. The anti-migratory 
activity of UA and UA-PM was evaluated in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells 
using the wound healing assay. Their effect on the activity of 
metalloproteinases (MMP)-2/9 involved in the migration process of cells was 
verified by gelatin zymography. The optimized UA-PM contained Soluplus, Solutol 
HS15, and TPGS in a 1:4:0.5 weight ratio and increased the aqueous solubility to 
about 150-fold solubilized, solubilizing 0.5 mg/mL of UA. UA-PM has a small size 
(45.39 ± 0.31 nm), a polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.26 ± 0.01, and an EE% of 
82.13 ± 5.57%. The colloidal dispersion was stable only for 9 days at 4 °C, 
while the freeze-drying process improved the stability for up to 30 days. UA was 
released for a prolonged period during the in vitro release study. The in vitro 
cell-based experiments showed that UA-PM (0.2 µg/mL) inhibited SH-SY5Y cell 
migration and the gelatinolytic activity of MMP-2/9 in culture media, while free 
UA at the same concentration exerted no biological activity. This study 
demonstrates that polymeric micelles are an excellent formulation for UA to 
manifest inhibitory action on neuroblastoma cell migration.

Unique hypoxia-tolerant subpopulations of adipose-derived stem cells: ITGB3(+) 
cells.

Cao J(1), Shen Y(2), Yang Z(3), Pan B(4), Liu Z(5).

BACKGROUND: We found by accident that stem cells could still be isolated from 
adipose tissue stored for 14 days in sealed tubes, which was distinct from 
previous protocols. The morphology of these hypoxia-tolerant stem cells also 
differs from that of conventional adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs). In this 
study, we aim to define the newly found subsets.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Stem cells were isolated from adipose tissue that was 
aspirated immediately or stored for 14 days. The stem cells were then harvested 
for flowcytometric analysis and differentiation potentials. The expression of 
hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) was assayed to confirm the 
hypoxia-tolerant ability. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed to find the 
common signatures of the hypoxia-tolerant cells. The result of bioinformatics 
was tested by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain 
reaction (qPCR) and western blotting.
RESULTS: Certain subsets of ADSCs can be isolated from adipose tissue stored for 
14 days. These survived cells were positive for CD90, CD105, and CD73 and showed 
multilineage differentiation potentials. The hypoxic condition was evidenced by 
up-regulation of HIF-1α for 2.0-fold changes (p < 0.05). The hypoxia-tolerant 
stem cells were distinct from multilineage-differentiating stress-enduring 
(Muse) cells, previously found stress-enduring stromal cells. RNA-seq suggested 
that integrin beta 3 (ITGB3) was highly expressed in hypoxia-tolerant 
subpopulations. The result was further confirmed at transcription and 
translation levels by qPCR and western blotting (mRNA: 2.9 ± 0.4, p < 0.05; 
protein: 1.5 ± 0.2, p < 0.05; respectively). The conventional ADSCs are positive 
for ITGB3, which implies that ITGB3+ cells are subpopulations of heterogeneous 
ADSCs.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals the ITGB3+ subsets with potent hypoxia tolerance, 
which has significant implications for improving fat retention rates and curing 
obesity-related diseases.

Ovine fertility by artificial insemination in the breeding season could be 
affected by intraseasonal variations in ram sperm proteomic profile.

Neila-Montero M(1), Alvarez M(1), Riesco MF(2), Montes-Garrido R(1), 
Palacin-Martinez C(1), Silva-Rodríguez A(3), Martín-Cano FE(4), Peña FJ(4), de 
Paz P(5), Anel L(1), Anel-Lopez L(6).

It is important to note that seasonality could affect ram reproductive 
parameters, and therefore, fertility results after artificial insemination. In 
this work, 1) we assessed fertility rates after cervical artificial insemination 
of 11,805 ewes at the beginning (June 21st to July 20th) and at the end 
(November 20th to December 21st) of the reproductive season in the Assaf breed 
for the last four years, and 2) we aimed to identify male factors influencing 
the different reproductive success obtained depending on the time at the mating 
season in which ovine artificial insemination was performed. For this purpose, 
we evaluated certain ram reproductive and ultrasonographical parameters as well 
as we performed a multiparametric and proteomic sperm analysis of 6-19 rams at 
two very distant points in the mating season (July as Early Breeding Season 
-EBS- and November as Late Breeding Season -LBS-). Rutinary assessments carried 
out in the ovine reproduction centers (testicular volume, libido, sperm 
production and mass motility) showed non-significant differences (P ≥ 0.05) 
between both studied times, as well as the ram ultrasonographic evaluation 
(Resistive and Pulsatility Index as Doppler parameters; and pixels mean gray 
level, and hypoechoic areas percentage and density as echotexture parameters). 
However, at level of sperm functionality, although sperm quality appeared 
non-significantly lower (P ≥ 0.05) in the EBS, we identified a significantly 
different (P < 0.05) sperm proteomic profile between the seasonality points. The 
following proteins were identified with the lowest abundance in the EBS with a 
fold change > 4, a P = 2.40e-07, and a q = 2.23e-06: Fibrous Sheath-Interacting 
Protein 2, Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase Domain-Containing Protein 20-like, 
Phosphoinositide-Specific Phospholipase C, Tektin 5, Armadillo Repeat-Containing 
Protein 12 Isoform X3, Solute Carrier Family 9B1, Radial Spoke Head Protein 3 
Homolog, Pro-Interleukin-16, NADH Dehydrogenase [Ubiquinone] 1 Alpha Subcomplex 
Subunit 8, Testis, Prostate and Placenta-Expressed Protein, and Acyl Carrier 
Protein Mitochondrial. In conclusion, while our basic analyses on male and sperm 
quality showed similar results between the beginning and the end of the breeding 
season, on a proteomic level we detected a lower expression of sperm proteins 
linked to the energy metabolism, sperm-oocyte interactions, and flagellum 
structure in the EBS. Probably, this different protein expression could be 
related to the lower fertility rate of Assaf ewes after cervical artificial 
insemination at this time. More importantly, sperm proteins can be used as 
highly effective molecular markers in predicting sperm fertilization ability 
related to intraseasonal variations.

STING-Triggered CNS Inflammation in Human Neurodegenerative Diseases.

Ferecskó AS(1)(2), Smallwood MJ(2), Moore A(1), Liddle C(3), Newcombe J(4), 
Holley J(2), Whatmore J(2), Gutowski NJ(2), Eggleton P(1)(2)(5).

BACKGROUND: Some neurodegenerative diseases have an element of neuroinflammation 
that is triggered by viral nucleic acids, resulting in the generation of type I 
interferons. In the cGAS-STING pathway, microbial and host-derived DNA bind and 
activate the DNA sensor cGAS, and the resulting cyclic dinucleotide, 2'3-cGAMP, 
binds to a critical adaptor protein, stimulator of interferon genes (STING), 
which leads to activation of downstream pathway components. However, there is 
limited work demonstrating the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway in human 
neurodegenerative diseases.
METHODS: Post-mortem CNS tissue from donors with multiple sclerosis (n = 4), 
Alzheimer's disease (n = 6), Parkinson's disease (n = 3), amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (n = 3) and non-neurodegenerative controls (n = 11) were screened by 
immunohistochemistry for STING and relevant protein aggregates (e.g., amyloid-β, 
α-synuclein, TDP-43). Human brain endothelial cells were cultured and stimulated 
with the STING agonist palmitic acid (1-400 μM) and assessed for mitochondrial 
stress (release of mitochondrial DNA into cytosol, increased oxygen 
consumption), downstream regulator factors, TBK-1/pIRF3 and inflammatory 
biomarker interferon-β release and changes in ICAM-1 integrin expression.
RESULTS: In neurodegenerative brain diseases, elevated STING protein was 
observed mainly in brain endothelial cells and neurons, compared to 
non-neurodegenerative control tissues where STING protein staining was weaker. 
Interestingly, a higher STING presence was associated with toxic protein 
aggregates (e.g., in neurons). Similarly high STING protein levels were observed 
within acute demyelinating lesions in multiple sclerosis subjects. To understand 
non-microbial/metabolic stress activation of the cGAS-STING pathway, brain 
endothelial cells were treated with palmitic acid. This evoked mitochondrial 
respiratory stress up to a ~2.5-fold increase in cellular oxygen consumption. 
Palmitic acid induced a statistically significant increase in cytosolic DNA 
leakage from endothelial cell mitochondria (Mander's coefficient; p < 0.05) and 
a significant increase in TBK-1, phosphorylated transcription factor IFN 
regulatory factor 3, cGAS and cell surface ICAM. In addition, a dose response in 
the secretion of interferon-β was observed, but it failed to reach statistical 
significance.
CONCLUSIONS: The histological evidence shows that the common cGAS-STING pathway 
appears to be activated in endothelial and neural cells in all four 
neurodegenerative diseases examined. Together with the in vitro data, this 
suggests that the STING pathway might be activated via perturbation of 
mitochondrial stress and DNA leakage, resulting in downstream neuroinflammation; 
hence, this pathway may be a target for future STING therapeutics.

The characteristics of nano-micron calcite particles/common bacteria complex and 
its interfacial interaction.

Zhao Y(1), Yang Y(1), Dong F(2), Dai Q(3).

Based on the composite pollution of atmospheric microbial aerosol, this paper 
selects the calcite/bacteria complex as the research object which was prepared 
by calcite particles and two common strains of bacteria (Escherichia coli, 
Staphylococcus aureus) in the solution system. The morphology, particle size, 
surface potential, and surface groups of the complex were explored by modern 
analysis and testing methods, with an emphasis on the interfacial interaction 
between calcite and bacteria. The SEM, TEM, and CLSM results showed that the 
morphology of the complex could be divided into three types: bacteria adhering 
to the surface or edge of micro-CaCO3, bacteria aggregating with nano-CaCO3, and 
single nano-CaCO3 wrapping bacteria. The complex's particle size was about 
2.07 ~ 192.4 times larger than the original mineral particles, and the 
nano-CaCO3/bacteria complex's particle size variation was caused by the fact 
that nano-CaCO3 has agglomeration in solution. The surface potential of the 
micro-CaCO3/bacteria complex (isoelectric point pH = 3.0) lies between 
micro-CaCO3 and bacteria, while the surface potential of the nano-CaCO3/bacteria 
complex (isoelectric point pH = 2.0) approaches the nano-CaCO3. The complex's 
surface groups were based primarily on the infrared characteristics of calcite 
particles, accompanied by the infrared characteristics of bacteria, displaying 
the interfacial interaction from the protein, polysaccharides, and 
phosphodiester groups of bacteria. The interfacial action of the 
micro-CaCO3/bacteria complex is mainly driven by electrostatic attraction and 
hydrogen bonding force, while the nano-CaCO3/bacteria complex is guided by 
surface complexation and hydrogen bonding force. The increase in the 
β-fold/α-helix ratio of the calcite/S. aureus complex indicated that the 
secondary structure of bacterial surface proteins was more stable and the 
hydrogen bond effect was strong than the calcite/E. coli complex. The findings 
are expected to provide basic data for the mechanism research of atmospheric 
composite particles closer to the real environment.

Protein Expression Profiles in Exosomes of Bovine Mammary Epithelial Cell Line 
MAC-T Infected with Staphylococcus aureus.

Zhu XY(#)(1), Wang ML(#)(1), Cai M(1), Nan XM(1), Zhao YG(1), Xiong BH(1), Yang 
L(1).

Mastitis is a common and widespread infectious disease in dairy farms around the 
world, resulting in reduced milk production and quality. Staphylococcus aureus 
is one of the main pathogenic bacteria causing subclinical mastitis in dairy 
cows. S. aureus can activate inflammatory signaling pathways in bovine mammary 
epithelial cells. Exosomes produced by cells can directly transfer 
pathogen-related molecules from cell to cell, thus affecting the process of 
infection. Protein is the material basis of the immune defense function in the 
body; therefore, a comprehensive comparison of proteins in exosomes derived from 
S. aureus-infected (SA group) and normal (control group [C group]) bovine 
mammary epithelial MAC-T cells was performed using shotgun proteomics by a DIA 
approach. A total of 7,070 proteins were identified and quantified. Compared 
with the C group, there were 802 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) 
identified in the SA group (absolute log2 fold change [|log2FC|] of ≥0.58; false 
discovery rate [FDR] of <0.05), among which 325 proteins were upregulated and 
477 were downregulated. The upregulated proteins, including complement 3 (C3), 
integrin alpha-6 (ITGA6), apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1), annexin A2 (ANXA2), 
tripeptidyl peptidase II (TPP2), keratin 8 (KRT8), and recombinant desmoyokin 
(AHNAK), are involved mostly in host defense against pathogens, inflammation, 
and cell structure maintenance. KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that DEPs in 
S. aureus infection were involved in the complement and coagulation cascade, 
phagosome, extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction, and focal adhesion 
pathways. The results of this study provide novel information about proteins in 
the exosomes of MAC-T cells infected with S. aureus and could contribute to an 
understanding of the infectious mechanism of bovine mastitis. IMPORTANCE 
Mastitis is a widespread infectious disease in dairy farms, resulting in reduced 
milk production and quality. Staphylococcus aureus is one of the main pathogenic 
bacteria causing subclinical mastitis. Exosomes contain proteins, lipids, and 
nucleic acids, which are involved in many physiological and pathological 
functions. The expression of proteins in exosomes derived from bovine mammary 
epithelial cells infected by S. aureus is still barely understood. These results 
provide novel information about MAC-T-derived exosomal proteins, reveal insights 
into their functions, and lay a foundation for further studying the biological 
function of exosomes during the inflammatory response.

Hepcidin antimicrobial peptide (hamp) is active in teleosts against invading 
pathogens and plays important roles in the stress and immune responses of 
finfish. The response of hamp gene was studied in yellow perch (yp) (Perca 
flavescens) challenged with lipopolysaccharides to understand if this immunity 
response is sex-specifically different. The cloned hamp gene consists of an 
open-reading frame of 273 bp and encodes a deduced protein of 90 amino acids 
(a.a.), which includes a signal peptide of 24 a.a., a pro-domain of 40 a.a. and 
a mature peptide of 26 a.a. Yp hamp involves 8 cysteine residues with 4 
disulfide bonds, and a protein with an internal alpha helix flanked with C- and 
N-terminal random coils was modeling predicted. RT-qPCR was used to analyze the 
relative abundances (RAs) of hamp mRNA in the livers of juvenile female and male 
yellow perch challenged with lipopolysaccharide. The expression levels of hamp 
were significantly elevated by 3 h (RA = 7.3) and then peaked by 6 h (RA = 29.4) 
post-treatment in females but the peak was delayed to 12 h (RA = 65.4) 
post-treatment in males. The peak mRNA level of challenged males was shown 
7.6-fold higher than females. The post-treatment responses in both genders 
decreased to their lowest levels by 24 h and 48 h. Overall, female perch had an 
earlier but less-sensitive response to the lipopolysaccharide challenge than 
male.

The effect of quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) on apoptotic, autophagic, antioxidant 
and inflammation markers in glucocorticoid-induced insulin resistance in rats.

Erfidan S(1), Dede S(2), Usta A(3), Yüksek V(4), Çetin S(5).

BACKGROUND: Insulin resistance plays an important role in predicting type 2 
diabetes that may develops. This study was planned in order to investigate the 
beneficial effects of quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) use in glucocorticoid 
induced-insulin resistance.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-two rats were used as the material (experimental) 
groups: the control group (C), the quinoa-administered group (Q), the insulin 
resistance-created group (IR), the IR + metformin group (IM), the IR + quinoa 
for treatment group (IQ) and the quinoa + IR for prophylaxis group (QI). Blood 
glucose, insulin levels and HOMA-IR were found to be highest (p < 0.05) in the 
IR group (p < 0.05). Glucose levels decreased significantly with the 
administration of quinoa and approached the levels of the control, but the 
insulin levels and the HOMA-IR did not significantly change. It was also 
observed that other biochemical parameters (ALT, AST, ALP, total cholesterol, 
total protein, urea and creatinine) changed significantly in the IR group and 
approached the levels of the control group with the administration of quinoa. 
Apoptotic (BCL2 5, BAX 9, CAS 3), autophagic (SQSTM1 7, ATG5) and inflammation 
(IL-1β, TNF-α) genes were upregulated by 5-11-fold in the IR group. In the 
groups in which quinoa was administered for treatment and protection, all these 
genes were found to be upregulated to a lower extent than the IR group. 
Antioxidant genes (GPX1, SOD1) increased by nine to tenfold in the quinoa 
groups.
CONCLUSION: As a result, after administration of quinoa, it was determined that 
the glucose level increased due to experimental insulin resistance and the liver 
and kidney damage indicators decreased. It was determined that quinoa 
(Chenopodium quinoa) had significant beneficial effects on biochemical 
parameters and apoptotic, autophagic, antioxidant and inflammatory markers in 
experimental glucocorticoid-induced insulin resistance.

PGC1α overexpression preserves muscle mass and function in cisplatin-induced 
cachexia.

Huot JR(1)(2), Pin F(2), Chatterjee R(1), Bonetto A(1)(2)(3)(4)(5).

BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy induces a cachectic-like phenotype, accompanied by 
skeletal muscle wasting, weakness and mitochondrial dysfunction. Peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC1α), a regulator 
of mitochondrial biogenesis, is often reduced in cachectic skeletal muscle. 
Overexpression of PGC1α has yielded mixed beneficial results in cancer cachexia, 
yet investigations using such approach in a chemotherapy setting are limited. 
Utilizing transgenic mice, we assessed whether overexpression of PGC1α could 
combat the skeletal muscle consequences of cisplatin.
METHODS: Young (2 month) and old (18 month) wild-type (WT) and PGC1α transgenic 
male and female mice (Tg) were injected with cisplatin (C; 2.5 mg/kg) for 
2 weeks, while control animals received saline (n = 5-9/group). Animals were 
assessed for muscle mass and force, motor unit connectivity, and expression of 
mitochondrial proteins.
RESULTS: Young WT + C mice displayed reduced gastrocnemius mass (male: -16%, 
P < 0.0001; female: -11%, P < 0.001), muscle force (-6%, P < 0.05, both sexes), 
and motor unit number estimation (MUNE; male: -53%, P < 0.01; female: -51%, 
P < 0.01). Old WT + C male and female mice exhibited gastrocnemius wasting 
(male: -22%, P < 0.05; female: -27%, P < 0.05), muscle weakness (male: -20%, 
P < 0.0001; female: -17%, P < 0.01), and loss of MUNE (male: -82%, P < 0.01; 
female: -62%, P < 0.05), suggesting exacerbated cachexia compared with younger 
animals. Overexpression of PGC1α had mild protective effects on muscle mass in 
young Tg + C male only (gastrocnemius: +10%, P < 0.05); however, force and MUNE 
were unchanged in both young Tg + C male and female, suggesting preservation of 
neuromuscular function. In older male, protective effects associated with PGC1α 
overexpression were heighted with Tg + C demonstrating preserved muscle mass 
(gastrocnemius: +34%, P < 0.001), muscle force (+13%, P < 0.01), and MUNE 
(+3-fold, P < 0.05). Similarly, old female Tg + C did not exhibit muscle wasting 
or reductions in MUNE, and had preserved muscle force (+11%, P < 0.05) compared 
with female WT + C. Follow-up molecular analysis demonstrated that aged WT 
animals were more susceptible to cisplatin-induced loss of mitochondrial 
proteins, including PGC1α, OPA1, cytochrome-C, and Cox IV.
CONCLUSIONS: In our study, the negative effects of cisplatin were heighted in 
aged animals, whereas overexpression of PGC1α was sufficient to combat the 
neuromuscular dysfunction caused by cisplatin, especially in older animals. 
Hence, our observations indicate that aged animals may be more susceptible to 
develop chemotherapy side toxicities and that mitochondria-targeted strategies 
may serve as a tool to prevent chemotherapy-induced muscle wasting and weakness.

FB2001 is a drug candidate that targets the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 via 
covalently binding to cysteine 145. In this study, we evaluated the inhibitory 
activities of FB2001 against several SARS-CoV-2 variants in vitro and in vivo 
(in mice), and we also evaluated the histopathological analysis and 
immunostaining of FB2001 on lung and brain which have been rarely reported. The 
results showed that FB2001 exhibited potent antiviral efficacy against several 
current SARS-CoV-2 variants in Vero E6 cells, namely, B.1.1.7 (Alpha): 
EC50 = 0.39 ± 0.01 μM, EC90 = 0.75 ± 0.01 μM; B.1.351 (Beta): 
EC50 = 0.28 ± 0.11 μM, EC90 = 0.57 ± 0.21 μM; B.1.617.2 (Delta): 
EC50 = 0.27 ± 0.05 μM, EC90 = 0.81 ± 0.20 μM; B.1.1.529 (Omicron): 
EC50 = 0.26 ± 0.06 μM and EC50 = 0.042 ± 0.007 μM (in the presence of a 
P-glycoprotein inhibitor). FB2001 remained potent against SARS-CoV-2 replication 
in the presence of high concentrations of human serum, which indicating that 
human serum had no significant effect on the in vitro inhibitory activity. 
Additionally, this inhibitor exhibited an additive effect against SARS-CoV-2 
when combined with Remdesivir. Furthermore, FB2001 significantly reduced the 
SARS-CoV-2 copy numbers and titers in the lungs and brains in vivo, and 
alleviated the pathological symptoms. In addition, FB2001 could alleviated local 
bleeding, erythrocyte overflow, edema, and inflammatory cell infiltration in 
brain tissue, and inhibitors reducing viral titers and improving inflammation in 
the brain have been rarely reported. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic 
model was established and verified to predict the FB2001 concentration in human 
lungs. When FB2001 was administered at 200 mg twice a day for 5 days, the 
observed Ctrough ss in plasma and predicted Ctrough ss of lung total 
concentration were 0.163 and 2.5 μg/mL, which were approximately 9 and 132-fold 
higher than the EC50 of 0.019 μg/mL (0.042 μM) against Omicron variant. Taken 
together, our study suggests that FB2001 is a promising therapeutic agent in 
COVID-19 treatment and can be combined with remdesivir to achieve improved 
clinical outcomes. Owing to its good safety and tolerability in healthy human 
(NCT05197179 and NCT04766931), FB2001 has been approved for Phase II/III 
clinical trial (NCT05445934).

Nano- and microparticles enter the body through the respiratory airways and the 
digestive system, or form as biominerals in the gall bladder, salivary glands, 
urinary bladder, kidney, or diabetic pancreas. Calcium, magnesium, and phosphate 
ions can precipitate from biological fluids in the presence of mucin as hybrid 
nanoparticles. Calcium carbonate nanocrystallites also trap mucin and are 
assembled into hybrid microparticles. Both mucin and calcium carbonate 
polymorphs (calcite, aragonite, and vaterite) are known to be components of such 
biominerals as gallstones which provoke inflammatory reactions. Our study was 
aimed at evaluation of neutrophil activation by hybrid vaterite-mucin 
microparticles (CCM). Vaterite microparticles (CC) and CCM were prepared under 
standard conditions. The diameter of CC and CCM was 3.3 ± 0.8 µm and 5.8 ± 0.7 
µm, with ƺ-potentials of -1 ± 1 mV and -7 ± 1 mV, respectively. CC 
microparticles injured less than 2% of erythrocytes in 2 h at 1.5 mg mL-1, and 
no hemolysis was detected with CCM; this let us exclude direct damage of 
cellular membranes by microparticles. Activation of neutrophils was analyzed by 
luminol- and lucigenin-dependent chemiluminescence (Lum-CL and Luc-CL), by 
cytokine gene expression (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10) and release (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, 
IL-10, TNF-α), and by light microscopy of stained smears. There was a 10-fold 
and higher increase in the amplitude of Lum-CL and Luc-CL after stimulation of 
neutrophils with CCM relative to CC. Adsorption of mucin onto prefabricated CC 
microparticles also contributed to activation of neutrophil CL, unlike mucin 
adsorption onto yeast cell walls (zymosan); adsorbed mucin partially suppressed 
zymosan-stimulated production of oxidants by neutrophils. Preliminary treatment 
of CCM with 0.1-10 mM NaOCl decreased subsequent activation of Lum-CL and Luc-CL 
of neutrophils depending on the used NaOCl concentration, presumably because of 
the surface mucin oxidation. Based on the results of ELISA, incubation of 
neutrophils with CCM downregulated IL-6 production but upregulated that of IL-8. 
IL-6 and IL-8 gene expression in neutrophils was not affected by CC or CCM 
according to RT2-PCR data, which means that post-translational regulation was 
involved. Light microscopy revealed adhesion of CC and CCM microparticles onto 
the neutrophils; CCM increased neutrophil aggregation with a tendency to form 
neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). We came to the conclusion that the main 
features of neutrophil reaction to mucin-vaterite hybrid microparticles are 
increased oxidant production, cell aggregation, and NET-like structure 
formation, but without significant cytokine release (except for IL-8). This 
effect of mucin is not anion-specific since particles of powdered kidney stone 
(mainly calcium oxalate) in the present study or calcium phosphate nanowires in 
our previous report also activated Lum-CL and Luc-CL response of neutrophils 
after mucin sorption.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for 
a global pandemic that has had significant impacts on human health and economies 
worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible and the cause of coronavirus 
disease 2019 in humans. A wide range of animal species have also been shown to 
be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 by experimental and/or natural infections. Sheep 
are a commonly farmed domestic ruminant that have not been thoroughly 
investigated for their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we performed in 
vitro and in vivo studies which consisted of infection of ruminant-derived cells 
and experimental challenge of sheep to investigate their susceptibility to 
SARS-CoV-2. Our results showed that sheep-derived kidney cells support 
SARS-CoV-2 replication. Furthermore, the experimental challenge of sheep 
demonstrated limited infection with viral RNA shed in nasal and oral swabs at 1 
and 3-days post challenge (DPC); viral RNA was also detected in the respiratory 
tract and lymphoid tissues at 4 and 8 DPC. Sero-reactivity was observed in some 
of the principal infected sheep but not the contact sentinels, indicating that 
transmission to co-mingled naïve sheep was not highly efficient; however, viral 
RNA was detected in respiratory tract tissues of sentinel animals at 21 DPC. 
Furthermore, we used a challenge inoculum consisting of a mixture of two 
SARS-CoV-2 isolates, representatives of the ancestral lineage A and the 
B.1.1.7-like alpha variant of concern, to study competition of the two virus 
strains. Our results indicate that sheep show low susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 
infection and that the alpha variant outcompeted the lineage A strain.

E(5), Fonseca C(6), Lonn E(7), Noè A(8), Schwende H(8), Butylin D(8), Chiang 
Y(9), Pascual-Figal D(10); TRANSITION investigators.

AIMS: Diabetes mellitus is associated with worse outcomes and lower attainment 
of disease-modifying therapies in patients with heart failure with reduced 
ejection fraction (HFrEF). This post hoc analysis of TRANSITION compared the 
patterns of tolerability and uptitration of sacubitril/valsartan in patients 
with HFrEF stabilized after hospital admission due to acute decompensated HF 
depending on the presence or absence of diabetes as a co-morbidity.
METHODS: TRANSITION, a randomized, open-label study compared 
sacubitril/valsartan initiation pre-discharge vs. post-discharge (up to14 days) 
in 991 patients hospitalized for acutely decompensated HFrEF. The impact of 
diabetes status on tolerability and safety was studied at 10-week and 26-week 
post-randomization.
RESULTS: Among the 991 patients analysed at baseline, 460 (46.4%) had diabetes 
and exhibited a higher risk profile. At 10 weeks, sacubitril/valsartan target 
dose (97/103 mg bid) was achieved in a similar proportion of patients in each 
subgroup, when initiated pre-discharge or post-discharge respectively [diabetes 
subgroup: 47% (n = 105/226) vs. 50% (n = 115/228); relative risk ratio (RRR), 
0.923; P = 0.412; non-diabetes subgroup: 45% (n = 119/267) vs. 51% 
(n = 133/261); RRR, 0.878; P = 0.155]. The proportions of patients achieving and 
maintaining either 49/51 mg or 97/103 mg bid [diabetes subgroup: 61.1% 
(n = 138/226) vs. 67.5% (n = 154/228); RRR, 0.909; P = 0.175; non-diabetes 
subgroup: 62.9% [n = 168/267] vs 69.3% [n = 181/261]; RRR, 0.906; P = 0.118] or 
any dose for ≥2 weeks leading to Week 10 [diabetes subgroup: 85% (n = 192/226) 
vs. 88.2% (n = 201/228); RRR, 0.966; P = 0.356; non-diabetes subgroup: 86.9% 
(n = 232/267) vs. 90.8% (n = 237/261); RRR, 0.963; P = 0.215] were also similar 
in each subgroup, when initiated pre-discharge or post-discharge, respectively. 
At 10 weeks, hypotension and renal dysfunction rates were similar, although 
hyperkalaemia was higher among patients with diabetes (15.9% vs. 9.5%). The rate 
of permanent discontinuation due to adverse events was similar in the diabetes 
and non-diabetes subgroups at 10 weeks, respectively: pre-discharge (7.5% vs. 
7.1%) or post-discharge (5.7% vs. 4.2%). Similar patterns of uptitration and 
tolerability were observed at 26 weeks. Cardiac biomarkers including NT-proBNP 
(P < 0.005) and hs-TnT (P < 0.005) reduced significantly from baseline levels in 
both subgroups at Weeks 4 and 10; however, the response was greater among 
patients without diabetes. Mortality (diabetes vs. non-diabetes subgroups: 3.3% 
vs 4.0%; P = 0.438) and HF rehospitalization (diabetes vs. non-diabetes 
subgroups: 36.3% vs. 33.0%; P = 0.295) did not differ between the groups at 
26 weeks.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite a higher risk profile among patients with diabetes, 
sacubitril/valsartan initiation either before or shortly after discharge in 
hospitalized patients with HFrEF resulted in comparable rates of dose 
up-titration and tolerability as in those without diabetes.

Comparing Salivary Caffeine Kinetics of (13)C and (12)C Caffeine for Gastric 
Emptying of 50 mL Water.

E(4), Tzvetkov MV(4), Weitschies W(1).

Gastric water emptying as a critical parameter for oral drug absorption can be 
investigated by several imaging techniques or by the interpretation of 
pharmacokinetics of appropriate substances. Recently introduced salivary 
caffeine kinetics is a valuable tool, but the required caffeine abstinence 
limits its applicability. To avoid the caffeine abstinence, stable 
isotope-labeled caffeine might be used, but the representability and 
transferability of kinetics for evaluation of gastric emptying must be 
demonstrated. Thus, salivary caffeine pharmacokinetics were compared for 
naturally occurring 12C-caffeine and 13C3-caffeine after the administration of 
water under fasting conditions in six healthy young subjects. For this purpose, 
an ice capsule containing the two caffeine species was administered with 50 mL 
tap water. Gastric water emptying was simultaneously quantified using magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI). Gastric emptying of 50 mL of water could be 
successfully evaluated. The salivary caffeine kinetics of 13C3- and 12C-caffeine 
were nearly congruent and showed good linear correlations in all subjects, with 
a mean correlation coefficient of 0.96 in pooled data. Thus, the substitution of 
natural 12C caffeine with stable isotope-labeled 13C3-caffeine offers the 
opportunity for broader application of the salivary caffeine gastric emptying 
technique and increases the robustness of the method against environmental 
contamination with caffeine.

In Vivo Evaluation of a Gastro-Resistant HPMC-Based "Next Generation Enteric" 
Capsule.

Rump A(1), Kromrey ML(2), Scheuch E(3), Jannin V(4), Rehenbrock L(1), Tzvetkov 
MV(3), Weitschies W(1), Grimm M(1).

Many orally dosed APIs are bioavailable only when formulated as an enteric 
dosage form to protect them from the harsh environment of the stomach. However, 
an enteric formulation is often accompanied with a higher development effort in 
the first place and the potential degradation of fragile APIs during the coating 
process. Ready-to-use enteric hard capsules would be an easily available 
alternative to test and develop APIs in enteric formulations, while decreasing 
the time and cost of process development. In this regard, Lonza Capsugel® Next 
Generation Enteric capsules offer a promising approach as functional capsules. 
The in vivo performance of these capsules was observed with two independent 
techniques (MRI and caffeine in saliva) in eight human volunteers. No 
disintegration or content release in the stomach was observed, even after highly 
variable individual gastric residence times (range 7.5 to 82.5 min), indicating 
the reliable enteric properties of these capsules. Seven capsules disintegrated 
in the distal part of the small intestine; one capsule showed an uncommonly fast 
intestinal transit (15 min) and disintegrated in the colon. The results for this 
latter capsule by MRI and caffeine appearance differed dramatically, whereas for 
all other capsules disintegrating in the small intestine, the results were very 
comparable, which highlights the necessity for reliable and complementary 
measurement methods. No correlation could be found between the gastric residence 
time and disintegration after gastric emptying, which confirms the robust 
enteric formulation of those capsules.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Subclinical intestinal inflammation is common in Crohn's 
disease (CD). We aimed to explore its impact in the disease progression of 
infliximab-treated patients and the usefulness of fecal calprotectin (FC) and 
C-reactive protein (CRP) as surrogate minimally invasive biomarkers.
METHODS: The registry-based, prospective, observational, multicenter DIRECT 
(study to investigate the correlation of fecal calprotectin with serum Drug 
levels and development of an antI-dRug antibodiEs among adult patients with 
inflammatory bowel disease reCeiving anti-TNF-alfa treatment or vedoluzimab 
treatment) study followed infliximab-treated CD patients for 2 years in a 
tertiary care setting. Persistent inflammation definition was based on FC (>150 
μg/g, >250 μg/g, or >350 μg/g) or serum CRP (>3 μg/mL) concentrations over 2 
consecutive or at least 3 visits. Patients were categorized according to a 
composite outcome reflecting disease progression that incorporated surgery; 
hospitalizations; new fistulae, abscess, or stricture; and treatment escalation.
RESULTS: Of 322 DIRECT study patients, 180 asymptomatic, infliximab treated on 
maintenance regimen were included in the analysis. Patients developing the 
composite endpoint (n = 96) presented higher median levels of FC (205 
[interquartile range, 98-515] μg/g; P = .045) but not of CRP (2.50 
[interquartile range, 0.80-6.00] μg/mL; P = .895). Biomarker-defined persistent 
subclinical inflammation prevalence ranged from 24% to 81%. Considering FC >250 
μg/g in 2 consecutive visits, prevalence was 50%, odds of achieving the endpoint 
were increased 3-fold (odds ratio, 2.996 [95% confidence interval, 
1.557-5.776]), and time-to-outcome occurrence was significantly lower among 
subjects with persistent inflammation (median time: 11 months). Both 
clinical-related and treatment-related components were significantly associated 
with persistent inflammation. Definitions based on CRP >3 μg/mL, FC >150 μg/g, 
FC >350 μg/g, double biomarkers (FC >250 μg/g and/or CRP >3 μg/mL), or more 
visits did not improve predictive ability.
CONCLUSIONS: Persistent inflammation, defined simply and readily by FC >250 μg/g 
over 2 consecutive visits, was associated with a significantly higher risk and 
shorter time to occurrence of a composite outcome reflecting disease progression 
in asymptomatic infliximab-treated CD patients.

Bilateral upper eyelid swelling (Hoagland sign) in Epstein-Barr infectious 
mononucleosis: prospective experience.

Bronz G(#)(1)(2), Zanetti BPESM(#)(3)(4), Bianchetti MG(3)(4), Milani GP(5)(6), 
Lava SAG(7)(8), Neuhaus TJ(9), Witschi A(10), Kottanattu L(3)(4).

BACKGROUND: The typical presentation of Epstein-Barr virus infectious 
mononucleosis includes fever, pharyngitis, measles-like rash, jaundice, and 
enlarged lymph nodes, liver, or spleen. A painless bilateral swelling of the 
upper eyelid, sometimes with drooping of the lateral aspect, may also occur. 
This sign, referred to as Hoagland sign, is not or only marginally mentioned in 
reviews and textbooks.
METHODS: Between 2019 and 2021, two of us evaluated all subjects with a positive 
acute Epstein-Barr virus serology for the typical signs of mononucleosis and for 
the possible existence of the Hoagland sign.
RESULTS: During the mentioned period, the diagnosis of mononucleosis was made in 
26 (14 females and 12 males) subjects aged from 9.0 to 33 years. The initial 
presentation included fever in 24, enlarged cervical lymph nodes in 23, 
pharyngitis in 21, a palpable liver in 7, a palpable spleen in 7, jaundice in 2, 
and a measles-like rash in 2 cases. The Hoagland sign was noted in 14 cases. 
Patients with and without Hoagland sign did not significantly differ with 
respect to age and sex.
CONCLUSIONS: The Hoagland sign is an easily identifiable clinical sign that is 
common and likely helpful early in the course of Epstein-Barr virus infectious 
mononucleosis. There is a need to expand awareness of this sign among 
physicians.

Wheat Germ Supplementation Reduces Inflammation and Gut Epithelial Barrier 
Dysfunction in Female Interleukin-10 Knockout Mice Fed a Pro-Atherogenic Diet.

Alake SE(1), Lightfoot S(2), Wozniak K(3), Lin D(1), Chowanadisai W(1), Smith 
BJ(4), Lucas EA(5).

BACKGROUND: Mice lacking IL-10 are prone to gut inflammation. Additionally, 
decreased production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) plays a significant role 
in the high-fat (HF) diet-induced loss of gut epithelial integrity. We have 
previously shown that wheat germ (WG) supplementation increased ileal expression 
of IL-22, an important cytokine in maintaining gut epithelial homeostasis.
OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the effects of WG supplementation on gut 
inflammation and epithelial integrity in IL-10 knockout mice fed a 
pro-atherogenic diet.
METHODS: Eight-week-old female C57BL/6 wild type mice were fed a control diet 
(10% fat kcal), and age-matched knockout mice were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 
diets (n = 10/group): control, high-fat high-cholesterol (HFHC) [(43.4% fat kcal 
(∼49% saturated fat, 1% cholesterol)], or HFHC + 10% WG (HFWG) for 12 wk. Fecal 
SCFAs and total indole, ileal, and serum proinflammatory cytokines, gene or 
protein expression of tight junctions, and immunomodulatory transcription 
factors were assessed. Data were analyzed by 1-way ANOVA, and P < 0.05 was 
considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: Fecal acetate, total SCFAs, and indole increased (P < 0.05) by at least 
20% in HFWG compared with the other groups. WG increased (P < 0.0001, 2-fold) 
ileal Il22 (interleukin 22) to Il22ra2 (interleukin 22 receptor, alpha 2) mRNA 
ratio and prevented the HFHC diet-mediated increase in ileal protein expression 
of indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase and pSTAT3 (phosphorylated signal transducer and 
activator of transcription 3). WG also prevented the HFHC diet-mediated 
reduction (P < 0.05) in ileal protein expression of the aryl hydrocarbon 
receptor and the tight junction protein, zonula occludens-1. Serum and ileal 
concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokine, IL-17, were lower (P < 0.05) by 
at least 30% in the HFWG group than in the HFHC group.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that the anti-inflammatory potential of WG 
in IL-10 KO mice consuming an atherogenic diet is partly attributable to its 
effects on the IL-22 signaling and pSTAT3-mediated production of T helper 17 
proinflammatory cytokines.

Singlet Oxygen Flux, Associated Lipid Photooxidation, and Membrane Expansion 
Dynamics Visualized on Giant Unilamellar Vesicles.

The physical properties of lipid membranes depend on their lipid composition. 
Photosensitized singlet oxygen (1O2) provides a handle to spatiotemporally 
control the generation of lipid hydroperoxides via the ene reaction, enabling 
fundamental studies on membrane dynamics in response to chemical composition 
changes. Critical to relating the physical properties of the lipid membrane to 
hydroperoxide formation is the availability of a sensitive reporter to quantify 
the arrival of 1O2. Here, we show that a fluorogenic α-tocopherol analogue, 
H4BPMHC, undergoes a >360-fold emission intensity enhancement in liposomes 
following a reaction with 1O2. Rapid quenching of 1O2 by the probe (kq = 4.9 × 
108 M-1 s-1) ensures zero-order kinetics of probe consumption. The remarkable 
intensity enhancement of H4BPMHC upon 1O2 trapping, its linear temporal 
behavior, and its protective role in outcompeting membrane damage provide a 
sensitive and reliable method to quantify the 1O2 flux on lipid membranes. Armed 
with this probe, fluorescence microscopy studies were devised to enable (i) 
monitoring the flux of photosensitized 1O2 into giant unilamellar vesicles 
(GUVs), (ii) establishing the onset of the ene reaction with the double bonds of 
monounsaturated lipids, and (iii) visualizing the ensuing collective membrane 
expansion dynamics associated with molecular changes in the lipid structure upon 
hydroperoxide formation. A correlation was observed between the time for 
antioxidant H4BPMHC consumption by 1O2 and the onset of membrane fluctuations 
and surface expansion. Together, our imaging studies with H4BPMHC in GUVs 
provide a methodology to explore the intimate relationship between 
photosensitizer activity, chemical insult, membrane morphology, and its 
collective dynamics.

Effects of PPARG and PPARGC1A gene polymorphisms on obesity markers.

Muntean C(1), Sasaran MO(2), Crisan A(3), Banescu C(3).

Pediatric obesity presents a multifactorial etiology, which involves genetic 
traits as well, including single nucleotide polymorphisms. The aim of the study 
is to investigate the contribution of PPARG gene polymorphisms (namely Pro12Ala 
rs1801282, His447His rs3856806, and Pro115Gln rs1800571) and PPARGC1A rs8192678 
SNP on the anthropometric and metabolic parameters in a population of Romanian 
children. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 295 Caucasian children, 
divided according to the body mass index (BMI) z-score into the study (obese and 
overweight) group of 130 children and the control (normoponderal) group of 165 
children. Anthropometric parameters were greater in the obese and overweight 
population as opposed to controls, with significant differences (p < 0.01) found 
for the weight (2.77 ± 1.54 SD vs. -0.04 ± 1.15 SD), body mass index (BMI) (2.28 
± 0.97 SD vs. -0.18 ± 1.19 SD), mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) (4.59 ± 2.28 
SD vs. 0.28 ± 3.45 SD), tricipital skin-fold (TSF) (3.31 ± 3.09 SD vs. 0.62 ± 
7.28 SD) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) (0.61 ± 1.51 SD vs. -0.35 ± 1.35 SD) 
z-scores. Moreover, triglyceride values were higher in the study group (118.70 ± 
71.99 SD vs. 77.09 ± 37.39 SD). No significant difference in the allele and 
genotype distribution of investigates gene polymorphisms was observed between 
the studied groups (p > 0.05). PPARG (rs1801282, rs3856806, and rs1800571) were 
not associated with demographic, anthropometric, and laboratory parameters. 
However, PPARGC1A rs8192678 CC genotype was associated with TSF z-score (p = 
0.03), whereas total and LDL cholesterol levels were significantly higher among 
TT homozygotes (p < 0.01). Our data suggest that PPARG (rs1801282, rs3856806, 
and rs1800571) and PPARGC1A (rs8192678) gene polymorphisms were not associated 
with childhood and adolescence overweight and obesity. The present study 
identified a significant increase in fasting glucose levels, triglyceride, 
albumin, and ALT levels in children with excess weight, as well as expected 
important upward variation of anthropometric parameters (BMI, MUAC, TSF 
z-scores).

Metabolic Potential of the Gut Microbiome Is Significantly Impacted by 
Conditioning Regimen in Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation 
Recipients.

M(3)(4), Paredes R(3)(5), Murray DD(1), Lundgren J(1)(2)(6), MacPherson CR(1), 
Sengeløv H(7).

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT) is a putative 
curative treatment for malignant hematologic disorders. During transplantation, 
the immune system is suppressed/eradicated through a conditioning regimen 
(non-myeloablative or myeloablative) and replaced with a donor immune system. In 
our previous study, we showed changes in gut taxonomic profiles and a decrease 
in bacterial diversity post-transplant. In this study, we expand the cohort with 
114 patients and focus on the impact of the conditioning regimens on taxonomic 
features and the metabolic functions of the gut bacteria. This is, to our 
knowledge, the first study to examine the metabolic potential of the gut 
microbiome in this patient group. Adult aHSCT recipients with shotgun sequenced 
stool samples collected day -30 to +28 relative to aHSCT were included. One 
sample was selected per patient per period: pre-aHSCT (day -30-0) and post-aHSCT 
(day 1-28). In total, 254 patients and 365 samples were included. Species 
richness, alpha diversity, gene richness and metabolic richness were all lower 
post-aHSCT than pre-aHSCT and the decline was more pronounced for the 
myeloablative group. The myeloablative group showed a decline in 36 genera and 
an increase in 15 genera. For the non-myeloablative group, 30 genera decreased 
and 16 increased with lower fold changes than observed in the myeloablative 
group. For the myeloablative group, 32 bacterial metabolic functions decreased, 
and one function increased. For the non-myeloablative group, three functions 
decreased, and two functions increased. Hence, the changes in taxonomy 
post-aHSCT caused a profound decline in bacterial metabolic functions especially 
in the myeloablative group, thus providing new evidence for associations of 
myeloablative conditioning and gut dysbiosis from a functional perspective.

Investigations on Cellular Uptake Mechanisms and Immunogenicity Profile of Novel 
Bio-Hybrid Nanovesicles.

In drug delivery, the development of nanovesicles that combine both synthetic 
and cellular components provides added biocompatibility and targeting 
specificity in comparison to conventional synthetic carriers such as liposomes. 
Produced through the fusion of U937 monocytes' membranes and synthetic lipids, 
our nano-cell vesicle technology systems (nCVTs) showed promising results as 
targeted cancer treatment. However, no investigation has been conducted yet on 
the immunogenic profile and the uptake mechanisms of nCVTs. Hence, this study 
was aimed at exploring the potential cytotoxicity and immune cells' activation 
by nCVTs, as well as the routes through which cells internalize these biohybrid 
systems. The endocytic pathways were selectively inhibited to establish if the 
presence of cellular components in nCVTs affected the internalization route in 
comparison to both liposomes (made up of synthetic lipids only) and 
nano-cellular membranes (made up of biological material only). As a result, 
nCVTs showed an 8-to-40-fold higher cellular internalization than liposomes 
within the first hour, mainly through receptor-mediated processes (i.e., 
clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis), and low immunostimulatory 
potential (as indicated by the level of IL-1α, IL-6, and TNF-α cytokines) both 
in vitro and in vivo. These data confirmed that nCVTs preserved surface cues 
from their parent U937 cells and can be rationally engineered to incorporate 
ligands that enhance the selective uptake and delivery toward target cells and 
tissues.

Age-restricted functional and developmental differences of neonatal platelets.

Liu Z(1), Avila C(2), Malone LE(3), Gnatenko DV(3)(4), Sheriff J(5), Zhu W(1), 
Bahou WF(2).

BACKGROUND: Developmental ontogeny of neonatal thrombopoiesis retains 
characteristics that are distinct from adults although molecular mechanisms 
remain unestablished.
METHODS: We applied multiparameter quantitative platelet responses with 
integrated ribosome profiling/transcriptomic studies to better define 
gene/pathway perturbations regulating the neonatal-to-adult transition. A 
bioinformatics pipeline was developed to identify stable, neonatal-restricted 
platelet biomarkers for clinical application.
RESULTS: Cord blood (CB) platelets retained the capacity for linear 
agonist-receptor coupling linked to phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure and 
α-granule release, although a restricted block in cross-agonist activation 
pathways was evident. Functional immaturity of synergistic signaling pathways 
was due to younger ontogenetic age and singular underdevelopment of the protein 
secretory gene network, with reciprocal expansion of developmental pathways 
(E2F, G2M checkpoint, c-Myc) important for megakaryocytopoiesis. Genetic 
perturbations regulating vesicle transport and fusion (TOM1L1, VAMP3, SNAP23, 
and DNM1L) and PS exposure and procoagulant activity (CLCN3) were the most 
significant, providing a molecular explanation for globally attenuated 
responses. Integrated transcriptomic and ribosomal footprints identified highly 
abundant (ribosome-protected) DEFA3 (encoding human defensin neutrophil peptide 
3) and HBG1 as stable biomarkers of neonatal thrombopoiesis. Studies comparing 
CB- or adult-derived megakaryocytopoiesis confirmed inducible and abundant DEFA3 
antigenic expression in CB megakaryocytes, ~3.5-fold greater than in leukocytes 
(the most abundant source in humans). An initial feasibility cohort of at-risk 
pregnancies manifested by maternal/fetal hemorrhage (chimerism) were applied for 
detection and validation of platelet HBG1 and DEFA3 as neonatal thrombopoiesis 
markers, most consistent for HBG1, which displayed gestational age-dependent 
expression.
CONCLUSIONS: These studies establish an ontogenetically divergent stage of 
neonatal thrombopoiesis, and provide initial feasibility studies to track 
disordered fetal-to-adult megakaryocytopoiesis in vivo.

H(6), Toan NL(6), Linh LTK(4)(5), Giang DP(5)(7), Kremsner PG(4)(8), Bang 
MH(5)(9), Song LH(#)(5)(7), Velavan TP(#)(4)(5).

BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of 
cancer-related mortality worldwide. It is a highly heterogeneous disease with 
poor prognosis and limited treatment options, which highlights the need for 
reliable biomarkers. This study aims to explore molecular markers that allow 
stratification of HCC and may lead to better prognosis and treatment prediction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 20 candidate genes (HCC hub genes, potential 
drug target genes, predominant somatic mutant genes) retrieved from literature 
and public databases with potential to be used as the molecular markers. We 
analysed expression of the genes by RT-qPCR in 30 HCC tumour and adjacent 
non-tumour paired samples from Vietnamese patients. Fold changes in expression 
were then determined using the 2-∆∆CT method, and unsupervised hierarchical 
clustering was generated using Cluster v3.0 software.
RESULTS: Clustering of expression data revealed two subtypes of tumours 
(proliferative and normal-like) and four clusters for genes. The expression 
profiles of the genes TOP2A, CDK1, BIRC5, GPC3, IGF2, and AFP were strongly 
correlated. Proliferative tumours were characterized by high expression of the 
c-MET, ARID1A, CTNNB1, RAF1, LGR5, and GLUL1 genes. TOP2A, CDK1, and BIRC5 HCC 
hub genes were highly expressed (> twofold) in 90% (27/30), 83% (25/30), and 83% 
(24/30) in the tissue samples, respectively. Among the drug target genes, high 
expression was observed in the GPC3, IGF2 and c-MET genes in 77% (23/30), 63% 
(19/30), and 37% (11/30), respectively. The somatic mutant Wnt/ß-catenin genes 
(CTNNB1, GLUL and LGR5) and TERT were highly expressed in 40% and 33% of HCCs, 
respectively. Among the HCC marker genes, a higher percentage of tumours showed 
GPC3 expression compared to AFP expression [73% (23/30) vs. 43% (13/30)].
CONCLUSION: The custom panel and molecular markers from this study may be useful 
for diagnosis, prognosis, biomarker-guided clinical trial design, and prediction 
of treatment outcomes.

YAP1 silencing attenuated lung injury/fibrosis but worsened diaphragmatic 
function by regulating oxidative stress and inflammation response in mice.

Zhang L(1), Ni S(1), Dai S(2), Chen H(3), Zhao Y(4).

Oxidative stress is a crucial mechanism in the pathophysiology of lung 
injury/fibrosis and diaphragmatic dysfunction. Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) 
is a key oxidative stress response regulator. However, how lung injury/fibrosis 
and the subsequent YAP1 silencing treatment affect diaphragmatic function 
remains largely uncharacterized. In this study, mice models of acute 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and paraquat exposure were used to establish acute lung 
injury and chronic pulmonary fibrosis. AT2 and C2C12 cells were co-cultured 
under LPS and paraquat challenge. YAP1 was interfered with shRNA given in vivo 
and verteporfin administration in vitro. Pulmonary histology, contractile 
properties, and cross-sectional areas (CSAs) of the diaphragm and gastrocnemius 
were evaluated. Histological and biochemical analyses were performed for 
targeted biomarker determination. We found that LPS and paraquat caused 
significant lung injury/fibrosis and significantly reduced the 
diaphragmatic-specific force and CSAs compared with the control. YAP1 silencing 
alleviated inflammatory cell infiltration or collagen deposition in the lungs 
yet worsened the already impaired diaphragmatic function by increasing 
inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α), mitochondrial reactive oxidative 
species (ROS) emission, protein degradation (Murf-1, atrogin-1, and calpain), 
and decreasing antioxidant capabilities (superoxide dismutase 2 and glutathione 
peroxidase). No significant improvements were observed in diaphragmatic function 
by transient YAP1 knockdown in the gastrocnemius. In vitro, LPS- or 
paraquat-caused cytotoxicity in AT2 cells was mostly alleviated by verteporfin 
in a concentration that was 20-fold higher than that in C2C12 cells (20 and 
1 μg/mL, respectively). Finally, 0.5 μg/mL of verteporfin significantly 
ameliorated hydrogen peroxide-induced proteolytic activity and antioxidant 
enzyme suppression in C2C12 cells, whereas 2 μg/mL of verteporfin deteriorated 
the same. Collectively, lung injury/fibrosis adversely affects the diaphragm. 
YAP1 inhibition alleviates lung injury/fibrosis but worsens diaphragmatic 
function potentially by enhancing inflammatory cytokines and ROS-mediated 
protein degradation. This disparity might be attributed to differences in 
susceptibility to YAP1 inhibition between muscles and the lungs.

PKC isoforms activate LRRK1 kinase by phosphorylating conserved residues 
(Ser1064, Ser1074 and Thr1075) within the CORB GTPase domain.

    Biochem J. 2023 Feb 14;480(3):219-223.

Leucine-rich-repeat-kinase 1 (LRRK1) and its homolog LRRK2 are multidomain 
kinases possessing a ROC-CORA-CORB containing GTPase domain and phosphorylate 
distinct Rab proteins. LRRK1 loss of function mutations cause the bone disorder 
osteosclerotic metaphyseal dysplasia, whereas LRRK2 missense mutations that 
enhance kinase activity cause Parkinson's disease. Previous work suggested that 
LRRK1 but not LRRK2, is activated via a Protein Kinase C (PKC)-dependent 
mechanism. Here we demonstrate that phosphorylation and activation of LRRK1 in 
HEK293 cells is blocked by PKC inhibitors including LXS-196 (Darovasertib), a 
compound that has entered clinical trials. We show multiple PKC isoforms 
phosphorylate and activate recombinant LRRK1 in a manner reversed by phosphatase 
treatment. PKCα unexpectedly does not activate LRRK1 by phosphorylating the 
kinase domain, but instead phosphorylates a cluster of conserved residues 
(Ser1064, Ser1074 and Thr1075) located within a region of the CORB domain of the 
GTPase domain. These residues are positioned at the equivalent region of the 
LRRK2 DK helix reported to stabilize the kinase domain αC-helix in the active 
conformation. Thr1075 represents an optimal PKC site phosphorylation motif and 
its mutation to Ala, blocked PKC-mediated activation of LRRK1. A triple Glu 
mutation of Ser1064/Ser1074/Thr1075 to mimic phosphorylation, enhanced LRRK1 
kinase activity ∼3-fold. From analysis of available structures, we postulate 
that phosphorylation of Ser1064, Ser1074 and Thr1075 activates LRRK1 by 
promoting interaction and stabilization of the αC-helix on the kinase domain. 
This study provides new fundamental insights into the mechanism controlling 
LRRK1 activity and reveals a novel unexpected activation mechanism.

Detecting Interplay of Chirality, Water, and Interfaces for Elucidating 
Biological Functions.

Yan ECY(1), Perets EA(1), Konstantinovsky D(1)(2), Hammes-Schiffer S(1).

Chemists have long been fascinated by chirality, water, and interfaces, making 
tremendous progress in each research area. However, the chemistry emerging from 
the interplay of chirality, water, and interfaces has been difficult to study 
due to technical challenges, creating a barrier to elucidating biological 
functions at interfaces. Most biopolymers (proteins, DNA, and RNA) fold into 
macroscopic chiral structures to perform biological functions. Their folding 
requires water, but water behaves differently at interfaces where the bulk water 
hydrogen-bonding network terminates. A question arises as to how water molecules 
rearrange to minimize free energy at interfaces while stabilizing the 
macroscopic folding of biopolymers to support biological function. This question 
is central to solving many research challenges, including the molecular origin 
of biological homochirality, folding and insertion of proteins into cell 
membranes, and the design of heterogeneous biocatalysts. Researchers can resolve 
these challenges if they have the theoretical tools to accurately predict 
molecular behaviors of water and biopolymers at various interfaces. However, 
developing such tools requires validation by the experimental data. These 
experimental data are scarce because few physical methods can simultaneously 
distinguish chiral folding of the biopolymers, separate signals of interfaces 
from the overwhelming background of bulk solvent, and differentiate water in 
hydration shells of the polymers from water elsewhere.We recently illustrated 
these very capacities of chirality-sensitive vibrational sum frequency 
generation spectroscopy (chiral SFG). While chiral SFG theory dictates that the 
method is surface-specific under the condition of electronic nonresonance, we 
show the method can distinguish chiral folding of proteins and DNA and probe 
water structures in the first hydration shell of proteins at interfaces. Using 
amide I signals, we observe protein folding into β-sheets without background 
signals from α-helices and disordered structures at interfaces, thereby 
demonstrating the effect of 2D crowding on protein folding. Also, chiral SFG 
signals of C-H stretches are silent from single-stranded DNA, but prominent for 
canonical antiparallel duplexes as well as noncanonical parallel duplexes at 
interfaces, allowing for sensing DNA secondary structures and hybridization. In 
establishing chiral SFG for detecting protein hydration structures, we observe 
an H218O isotopic shift that reveals water contribution to the chiral SFG 
spectra. Additionally, the phase of the O-H stretching bands flips when the 
protein chirality is switched from L to D. These experimental results agree with 
our simulated chiral SFG spectra of water hydrating the β-sheet protein at the 
vacuum-water interface. The simulations further reveal that over 90% of the 
total chiral SFG signal comes from water in the first hydration shell. We 
conclude that the chiral SFG signals originate from achiral water molecules that 
assemble around the protein into a chiral supramolecular structure with 
chirality transferred from the protein. As water O-H stretches can reveal 
hydrogen-bonding interactions, chiral SFG shows promise in probing the 
structures and dynamics of water-biopolymer interactions at interfaces. 
Altogether, our work has created an experimental and computational framework for 
chiral SFG to elucidate biological functions at interfaces, setting the stage 
for probing the intricate chemical interplay of chirality, water, and 
interfaces.

Gluten accumulation damages the proximal small intestine and causes celiac 
disease (CeD) which has not been effectively treated except by using a 
gluten-free diet. In this study, strain Bacillus subtilis LZU-GM was isolated 
from Pakistani traditional fermented sourdough and could degrade 73.7% of gluten 
in 24 h in vitro. Strain LZU-GM was employed for practical application to 
investigate gluten degradation in mice models. The results showed that strain 
LZU-GM was colonized in mice and the survival rate was around 0.95 % 
(P < 0.0001). The gluten degradation was 3-fold higher in the small intestine of 
the strain LZU-GM treated mice group remaining 1511.96 ng/mL of gluten peptides 
than the untreated mice group (6500.38 ng/mL). Immunochemical analysis showed 
that gluten-treated mice established positive antigliadin antibodies (AGA) in 
serum (IgA, IgG, and anti-TG2 antibodies) as compared to the strain LZU-GM 
treatment group. Furthermore, the number of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-10, and COX-2 cells 
decrease in the lamina propria of the strain LZU-GM treatment group 
(P < 0.0001). Microbial community bar plot analysis showed that Lactobacillus, 
Dubosiella, and Enterococcus genera were restored and stabilized in the LZU-GM 
treatment group while Blautia and Ruminococcus were found lower. The oral gavage 
of probiotic strain LZU-GM might be useful for gluten metabolism in the 
intestine during digestion and would be a long-term dietary treatment for CeD 
management.

This study was to evaluate the mitigative effects of vitamin C (VC) on growth 
inhibition and intestinal damage induced by glycinin in juvenile Rhynchocypris 
lagowskii Dybowski. 270 healthy juvenile Rhynchocypris lagowskii Dybowski 
(4.65 ± 0.04 g) were randomly divided into 3 treatments, and fed with control 
diet, 80 g/kg glycinin diet and 80 g/kg glycinin+200 mg/kg VC diet respectively 
for 8 weeks. The results showed that glycinin significantly decreased the weight 
gain rate, specific growth rate, protein efficiency rate, feed efficiency rate 
and feeding rate of fish compared with the control group (P < 0.05), while VC 
supplementation improved the growth performance and feed utilization efficiency, 
and reached a level similar to the control group. Similarly, VC significantly 
increased the crude protein content of muscle and whole-body, and hepatopancreas 
and intestinal protease activities of fish fed with glycinin diet (P < 0.05). 
The distal intestine of fish in glycinin group showed typical damage 
characteristics, including breakage and atrophy of intestinal mucosal fold, and 
increased intestinal mucosal permeability. However, fish fed the glycinin + VC 
diet showed an unimpaired normal intestinal morphology. Usefully, VC 
supplementation could also restore impaired immune function and antioxidant 
capacity. VC down-regulated the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α 
and IL-1β, and up-regulated the mRNA levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 
and TGF-β in the distal intestine of fish fed with glycinin. Furthermore, 
glycinin exposure could reduce the mRNA levels of HO-1, CAT and GPx by 
inhibiting the activation of Nrf2-Keap1 signaling pathway, while VC 
supplementation reversed this phenomenon and maintained the homeostasis of 
antioxidant defense system. Concluded, glycinin causes growth inhibition, 
digestive dysfunction and intestinal damage of Rhynchocypris lagowskii Dybowski, 
while sufficient VC intake is beneficial for fish to resist the adverse effects 
of glycinin.

[(18)F]fluorinated Cyanine-Containing Probe and Preliminary In Vitro/Vivo 
Evaluation by Fluorescence Imaging.

Considering the individual characteristics of positron emission tomography (PET) 
and optical imaging (OI) in terms of sensitivity, spatial resolution, and tissue 
penetration, the development of dual imaging agents for bimodal PET/OI imaging 
is a growing field. A current major breakthrough in this field is the design of 
monomolecular agent displaying both a radioisotope for PET and a fluorescent dye 
for OI. We took advantage of the multifunctionalities allowed by a clickable 
C-glycosyl scaffold to gather the different elements. We describe, for the first 
time, the synthesis of a cyanine-based dual PET/OI imaging probe based on a 
versatile synthetic strategy and its direct radiofluorination via [18F]F-C bond 
formation. The non-radioactive dual imaging probe coupled with two c(RGDfK) 
peptides was evaluated in vitro and in vivo in fluorescence imaging. The binding 
on αvβ3 integrin (IC50 = 16 nM) demonstrated the efficiency of the dimeric 
structure and PEG linkers in maintaining the affinity. In vivo fluorescence 
imaging of U-87 MG engrafted nude mice showed a high tumor uptake (40- and 
100-fold increase for orthotopic and ectopic brain tumors, respectively, 
compared to healthy brain). In vitro and in vivo evaluations and resection of 
the ectopic tumor demonstrated the potential of the conjugate in glioblastoma 
cancer diagnosis and image-guided surgery.

Metallo-β-lactamase Inhibitors Showing Potent Synergistic Activity on VIM- and 
NDM-1-Producing Clinical Isolates.

Metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) contribute to the resistance of Gram-negative 
bacteria to carbapenems, last-resort antibiotics at hospital, and MBL inhibitors 
are urgently needed to preserve these important antibacterial drugs. Here, we 
describe a series of 1,2,4-triazole-3-thione-based inhibitors displaying an 
α-amino acid substituent, which amine was mono- or disubstituted by (hetero)aryl 
groups. Compounds disubstituted by certain nitrogen-containing heterocycles 
showed submicromolar activities against VIM-type enzymes and strong NDM-1 
inhibition (Ki = 10-30 nM). Equilibrium dialysis, native mass spectrometry, 
isothermal calorimetry (ITC), and X-ray crystallography showed that the 
compounds inhibited both VIM-2 and NDM-1 at least partially by stripping the 
catalytic zinc ions. These inhibitors also displayed a very potent synergistic 
activity with meropenem (16- to 1000-fold minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 
reduction) against VIM-type- and NDM-1-producing ultraresistant clinical 
isolates, including Enterobacterales and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Furthermore, 
selected compounds exhibited no or moderate toxicity toward HeLa cells, 
favorable absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADME) properties, and 
no or modest inhibition of several mammalian metalloenzymes.

Insertion of circularly permuted cyan fluorescent protein into the 
ligand-binding domain of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor for enhanced FRET 
upon binding of fluorescent ligand.

Binding of fluorescent ligand (FL) to the cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)-coupled 
ligand-binding domain of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor 
(CFP-LBP) produces fluorescence (Förster) resonance energy transfer (FRET). A 
competitive fluorescent ligand assay (CFLA), using the FRET signal from 
competition between FLs and IP3, can measure IP3 concentration. The FRET signal 
should be enhanced by attaching a FRET donor to an appropriate position. Herein, 
we inserted five different circularly permuted CFPs in the loop between the 
second and third α-helices to generate membrane-targeted fluorescent 
ligand-binding proteins (LBPs). Two such proteins, LBP-cpC157 and LBP-cpC173, 
localized at the plasma membrane, displayed FRET upon binding the high-affinity 
ligand fluorescent adenophostin A (F-ADA), and exhibited a decreased 
fluorescence emission ratio (480 nm / 535 nm) by 1.6- to 1.8-fold that of 
CFP-LBP. In addition, binding of a fluorescent low-affinity ligand (F-LL) also 
reduced the fluorescence ratio in a concentration-dependent manner, with EC50 
values for LBP-cpC157 and LBP-cpC173 of 34.7 nM and 27.6 nM, respectively. These 
values are comparable to that with CFP-LBP (29.2 nM), indicating that insertion 
of cpC157 and cpC173 did not disrupt LBP structure and function. The effect of 
100 nM F-LL on the decrease in fluorescence ratio was reversed upon addition of 
IP3, indicating binding competition between F-LL and IP3. We also constructed 
cytoplasmic fluorescent proteins cyLBP-cpC157 and cyLBP-cpC173, and bound them 
to DYK beads for imaging analyses. Application of F-ADA decreased the 
fluorescence ratio of the beads from the periphery to the center over 3 - 5 min. 
Application of F-LL also decreased the fluorescence ratio of cyLBP-cpC157 and 
cyLBP-cpC173 by 20-25%, and subsequent addition of IP3 recovered the 
fluorescence ratio in a concentration-dependent manner. The EC50 value and Hill 
coefficient obtained by curve fitting against the IP3-dependent recovery of 
fluorescence ratio can be used to estimate the IP3 concentration.

treatment in rheumatoid arthritis patients.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune condition, characterised by 
joint pain, damage and disability, which can be addressed in a high proportion 
of patients by timely use of targeted biologic treatments. However, the 
patients, non-responsive to the treatments often suffer from refractoriness of 
the disease, leading to poor quality of life. Additionally, the biologic 
treatments are expensive. We obtained plasma samples from N = 144 participants 
with RA, who were about to commence anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) 
therapy. These samples were sent to Olink Proteomics, Uppsala, Sweden, where 
proximity extension assays of 4 panels, containing 92 proteins each, were 
performed. A total of n = 89 samples of patients passed the quality control of 
anti-TNF treatment response data. The preliminary analysis of plasma protein 
expression values suggested that the RA population could be divided into two 
distinct molecular sub-groups (endotypes). However, these broad groups did not 
predict response to anti-TNF treatment, but were significantly different in 
terms of gender and their disease activity. We then labelled these patients as 
responders (n = 60) and non-responders (n = 29) based on the change in disease 
activity score (DAS) after 6 months of anti-TNF treatment and applied machine 
learning (ML) with a rigorous 5-fold nested cross-validation scheme to filter 17 
proteins that were significantly associated with the treatment response. We have 
developed a ML based classifier ATRPred (anti-TNF treatment response predictor), 
which can predict anti-TNF treatment response in RA patients with 81% accuracy, 
75% sensitivity and 86% specificity. ATRPred may aid clinicians to direct 
anti-TNF therapy to patients most likely to receive benefit, thus save cost as 
well as prevent non-responsive patients from refractory consequences. ATRPred is 
implemented in R.

BACKGROUND: Comprehensive pathogen genomic surveillance represents a powerful 
tool to complement and advance precision vaccinology. The emergence of the Alpha 
variant in December 2020 and the resulting efforts to track the spread of this 
and other severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants 
of concern led to an expansion of genomic sequencing activities in Germany.
METHODS: At Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the German National Institute of Public 
Health, we established the Integrated Molecular Surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 
(IMS-SC2) network to perform SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance at the national 
scale, SARS-CoV-2-positive samples from laboratories distributed across Germany 
regularly undergo whole-genome sequencing at RKI.
RESULTS: We report analyses of 3623 SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected between 
December 2020 and December 2021, of which 3282 were randomly sampled. All 
variants of concern were identified in the sequenced sample set, at ratios 
equivalent to those in the 100-fold larger German GISAID sequence dataset from 
the same time period. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed variant assignments. 
Multiple mutations of concern emerged during the observation period. To model 
vaccine effectiveness in vitro, we employed authentic-virus neutralization 
assays, confirming that both the Beta and Zeta variants are capable of immune 
evasion. The IMS-SC2 sequence dataset facilitated an estimate of the SARS-CoV-2 
incidence based on genetic evolution rates. Together with modeled vaccine 
efficacies, Delta-specific incidence estimation indicated that the German 
vaccination campaign contributed substantially to a deceleration of the nascent 
German Delta wave.
CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 molecular and genomic surveillance may inform public 
health policies including vaccination strategies and enable a proactive approach 
to controlling coronavirus disease 2019 spread as the virus evolves.

Phosphoenolpyruvate induces endothelial dysfunction and cell senescence through 
stimulation of metabolic reprogramming.

Endothelial dysfunction is a key early link in the pathogenesis of 
atherosclerosis, and the accumulation of senescent vascular endothelial cells 
causes endothelial dysfunction. Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), which is a 
high-energy glycolytic intermediate, protects against ischemia-reperfusion 
injury in isolated rat lung, heart, and liver tissue by quickly providing ATP. 
However, it was reported that serum PEP concentrations are 13-fold higher in 
healthy elderly compare to the young. Unlike that of other cell types, the 
energy required for the physiological function of endothelial cells is mainly 
derived from glycolysis. Recently, it is unclear whether circulating 
accumulation of PEP affects endothelial cell function. In this study, we found 
for the first time that 50-250 μM of PEP significantly promoted THP-1 monocyte 
adhesion to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) through increased 
expression of vascular endothelial adhesion factor 1 (VCAM1) and intercellular 
adhesion factor 1 (ICAM1) in HUVECs. Meanwhile, 50-250 μM of PEP decreased the 
expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and cellular level of 
nitric oxide (NO) in HUVECs. Moreover, PEP increased levels of ROS, enhanced the 
numbers of SA-β-Gal-positive cells and upregulated the expression of cell cycle 
inhibitors such as p21, p16 and the phosphorylation level of p53 on Ser15, and 
the expression of proinflammatory factors including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, 
IL-18 and MCP-1 in HUVECs. Furthermore, PEP increased both oxygen consumption 
rate (OCR) and glycolysis rate, and was accompanied by reduced NAD+/NADH ratios 
and enhanced phosphorylation levels of AMPKα (Thr172), p38 MAPK (T180/Y182) and 
NF-κB p65 (Ser536) in HUVECs. Notably, PEP had no significant effect on hepG2 
cells. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that PEP induced dysfunction 
and senescence in vascular endothelial cells through stimulation of metabolic 
reprogramming.

Synthesis and biological evaluation of geniposide derivatives as inhibitors of 
hyperuricemia, inflammatory and fibrosis.

MQ(2), Sun JY(5), Liu YF(6), Liu C(7).

Hyperuricemia is a metabolic disease caused by abnormal purine metabolism in the 
body. Long-term high levels of uric acid in the body will lead to gout and 
kidney disease. Xanthine oxidase (XOD) is a key enzyme in the pathogenesis of 
hyperuricemia. In this context, a series of geniposide derivatives were 
designed, synthesized and evaluated as xanthine oxidase inhibitors. Most of 
these compounds exhibited potent XOD inhibitory activities in vitro, and 
representatives 6a, 6c, 6g and 6j were found to be the most potent inhibitors 
against the enzyme with IC50 values of 2.15 ± 1.03, 1.37± 0.26, 4.14± 0.79 and 
1.86± 0.13 μM, which were 33.03-158.37 fold more active than geniposide, 
respectively. Compounds 6a, 6c, 6g and 6j were evaluated in hyperuricemia mice, 
and the results demonstrated that compound 6c showed the strongest 
anti-hyperuricemia and renal protective activity in vivo. Subsequently, the 
molecular mechanism of compound 6c was studied in this investigation. In vitro 
cell experiments showed that compound 6c inhibited the inflammation of 
HK-2 cells under high uric acid conditions by inhibiting the expressions of 
TGF-β, TNF-α and IL-1β, and reduced the cell fibrosis by decreasing the 
expressions of α-SMA and Collagen I. The results of the mice experiments 
indicated that compound 6c efficiently decreased the level of serum uric acid 
(SUA) in hyperuricemia mice by inhibiting the XOD activity. Moreover, compound 
6c effectively reduced the urate accumulation in the kidney and simultaneously 
decreased inflammation by regulating the expression of the TLR4/IκBα/NF-κB 
signaling pathway. In addition, consistent with cell experiments, compound 6c 
also reduced renal fibrosis in hyperuricemia mice, which may be due to compound 
6c inhibiting the expression of inflammatory factor TGF-β. Furthermore, a 
molecular docking study was performed to gain insight into the binding mode of 
compound 6c with XOD. These results suggest that compound 6c has the potential 
to be developed into a novel medicine to reduce blood uric acid and treat renal 
diseases caused by hyperuricemia.

ABSTRACTSARS-CoV-2 was first reported circulating in human populations in 
December 2019 and has since become a global pandemic. Recent history involving 
SARS-like coronavirus outbreaks have demonstrated the significant role of 
intermediate hosts in viral maintenance and transmission. Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 
natural infection and experimental infections of a wide variety of animal 
species has been demonstrated, and in silico and in vitro studies have indicated 
that deer are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. White-tailed deer (WTD) are 
amongst the most abundant and geographically widespread wild ruminant species in 
the US. Recently, WTD fawns were shown to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. In the 
present study, we investigated the susceptibility and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 
in adult WTD. In addition, we examined the competition of two SARS-CoV-2 
isolates, representatives of the ancestral lineage A and the alpha variant of 
concern (VOC) B.1.1.7 through co-infection of WTD. Next-generation sequencing 
was used to determine the presence and transmission of each strain in the 
co-infected and contact sentinel animals. Our results demonstrate that adult WTD 
are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and can transmit the virus 
through direct contact as well as vertically from doe to fetus. Additionally, we 
determined that the alpha VOC B.1.1.7 isolate of SARS-CoV-2 outcompetes the 
ancestral lineage A isolate in WTD, as demonstrated by the genome of the virus 
shed from nasal and oral cavities from principal infected and contact animals, 
and from the genome of virus present in tissues of principal infected deer, 
fetuses and contact animals.

Therapeutic drug monitoring guided dosing versus standard dosing of alectinib in 
advanced ALK positive non-small cell lung cancer patients: Study protocol for an 
international, multicenter phase IV randomized controlled trial (ADAPT ALEC).

ADR(1)(16)(17), Steeghs N(18), van der Wekken AJ(2).

BACKGROUND: Alectinib is first-line therapy in patients with stage IV non-small 
cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and an anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion. A 
shorter median progression-free survival (mPFS) was observed when alectinib 
minimum plasma concentrations during steady state (Cmin,SS) were below 435 
ng/mL. This may suggest that patients should have an alectinib Cmin,SS ≥ 435 
ng/mL for a more favorable outcome. This potential target could be attained by 
using therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), i.e. adjusting the dose based on 
measured plasma trough concentrations. Hypothetically, this will increase mPFS, 
but this has not yet been evaluated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). 
Therefore, the ADAPT ALEC trial is designed, with the primary objective to 
prolong mPFS in NSCLC patients treated with alectinib by using TDM.
METHODS: ADAPT ALEC is a multicenter, phase IV RCT, in which patients aged ≥ 18 
years with advanced ALK positive (+) NSCLC eligible for alectinib in daily care 
are enrolled. Participants will be randomized (1:1 ratio) into intervention arm 
A (TDM) or B (control), stratified by brain metastases and prior ALK treatments. 
Starting dose in both arms is the approved flat fixed dose of alectinib 600 mg 
taken twice daily with food. In case of alectinib Cmin,SS < 435 ng/mL, arm A 
will receive increased doses of alectinib till Cmin,SS ≥ 435 ng/mL when 
considered tolerable. The primary outcome is mPFS, where progressive disease is 
defined according to RECIST v1.1 or all-cause death and assessed by CT-scans and 
MRI brain. Secondary endpoints are feasibility and tolerability of TDM, patient 
and physician adherence, overall response rate, median overall survival, 
intracranial PFS, quality of life, toxicity, alectinib-M4 concentrations and 
cost-effectiveness of TDM. Exploratory endpoints are circulating tumor DNA and 
body composition.
DISCUSSION: The ADAPT ALEC will show whether treatment outcomes of patients with 
advanced ALK+ NSCLC improve when using TDM-guided dosing of alectinib instead of 
fixed dosing. The results will provide high quality evidence for deciding 
whether TDM should be implemented as standard of care and this will have 
important consequences for the prescribing of alectinib.

heterologous booster vaccination in health care workers primed with two doses of 
ChAdOx1 nCov-19: A single-blinded, randomized clinical trial.

OBJECTIVES: We conducted a single-blinded, randomized trial to evaluate the 
safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of heterologous booster vaccination 
in health care workers (HCW) who had received two doses of ChAdOx1 nCov-19.
METHODS: HCW who had at least 90 days after the second dose were enrolled to 
receive one of the four vaccines: BNT162b2 (30 μg), half-dose mRNA-1273 (50 μg), 
mRNA-1273 (100 μg), and MVC-COV1901 (15 μg). The primary outcomes were humoral 
and cellular immunogenicity and secondary outcomes assessed safety and 
reactogenicity at 28 days post-booster.
RESULTS: MVC-COV1901 Three hundred and forty HCW were enrolled: 83 received 
BNT162b2 (2 excluded), 85 half-dose mRNA-1273, 85 mRNA-1273, and 85 MVC-COV1901. 
mRNA vaccines had more reactogenicity than protein vaccine. The fold-rise of 
anti-spike IgG geometric mean titer was 8.4 (95% CI 6.8-10.4) for MVC-COV1901, 
32.2 (27.2-38.1) for BNT162b2, 47.6 (40.8-55.6) for half-dose mRNA-1273 and 63.2 
(53.6-74.6) for mRNA-1273. The live virus microneutralization assays (LVMNA) 
against the wild type, alpha and delta variants were consistent with anti-spike 
IgG for all booster vaccines. The LVMNA in the four groups against omicron BA.1 
variant were 6.4 to 13.5 times lower than those against the wild type. All 
booster vaccines induced a comparable T cell response.
CONCLUSIONS: Third dose booster not only increases neutralizing antibody titer 
but also enhances antibody breadth against SARS-CoV-2 variants. mRNA vaccines 
are preferred booster vaccines for those who received primary series of ChAdOx1 
nCov-19.

INTRODUCTION: The lack of knowledge regarding the differences between Chinese 
and other ethnicities in the early manifestation of late-onset Pompe disease 
(LOPD) prohibits the development of an effective screening strategy. We 
conducted a multicenter screening study to determine LOPD prevalence in 
high-risk populations and define the early manifestation of LOPD in China.
METHODS: Between August 2020 and April 2021, the participants were prospectively 
identified through medical examination at 20 centers from inpatient departments 
and outpatient neuromuscular clinics in China. The inclusion criteria were as 
follows: (1) age ≥ 1 year and (2) either one of the following conditions: (a) 
persistent hyperCKemia, (b) muscle weakness of the axial and/or limb-girdle 
muscles, or (c) unexplained restrictive respiratory insufficiency (RI). 
Enzymatic activity of acid α-glucosidase (GAA) was measured in a dried blood 
spot (DBS) using a tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) assay. Next-generation 
sequencing (NGS) was used to evaluate all samples with decreased GAA activity, 
searching for GAA mutations and pseudodeficiency alleles.
RESULTS: Among the 492 cases, 26 positive samples (5.3%) were detected in the 
DBS test. Molecular studies confirmed a diagnosis of LOPD in eight cases (1.6%). 
Using MS/MS assay, GAA activities in individuals with pseudodeficiency could be 
distinguished from those in patients with LOPD. The median interval from the 
onset of symptoms to diagnosis was 5 years. All patients also showed RI, with a 
mean forced vital capacity (FVC) of 48%, in addition to axial/proximal muscle 
weakness. The creatine kinase (CK) level ranged from normal to no more than 
5-fold the upper normal limit (UNL). LOPD with isolated hyperCKemia was not 
identified.
CONCLUSION: Less frequent hyperCKemia and predominant RI depict a different 
early portrait of adult Chinese patients with LOPD. A modified high-risk 
screening strategy should be proposed for the early diagnosis of Chinese 
patients with LOPD.

Polar auxin transport is unique to plants and coordinates their growth and 
development1,2. The PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin transporters exhibit highly 
asymmetrical localizations at the plasma membrane and drive polar auxin 
transport3,4; however, their structures and transport mechanisms remain largely 
unknown. Here, we report three inward-facing conformation structures of 
Arabidopsis thaliana PIN1: the apo state, bound to the natural auxin 
indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), and in complex with the polar auxin transport 
inhibitor N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA). The transmembrane domain of PIN1 
shares a conserved NhaA fold5. In the substrate-bound structure, IAA is 
coordinated by both hydrophobic stacking and hydrogen bonding. NPA competes with 
IAA for the same site at the intracellular pocket, but with a much higher 
affinity. These findings inform our understanding of the substrate recognition 
and transport mechanisms of PINs and set up a framework for future research on 
directional auxin transport, one of the most crucial processes underlying plant 
development.

Non-invasive assessment of fecal glucocorticoid, progesterone, and androgen 
metabolites and microbiome in free-ranging southern white rhinoceros 
(Ceratotherium simum simum) in South Africa.

Increased poaching in northern South Africa has necessitated relocation of large 
numbers of southern white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum simum) to the Eastern 
Cape Province. The climate and grassland ecology of this province differ from 
that of northern South Africa which may impact the health of this species. This 
assessment of fecal steroid levels and microbiome in 10 free-ranging southern 
white rhinoceros in the Eastern Cape will provide insights into white rhinoceros 
physiology in this biome. Fecal steroid metabolites were analyzed using enzyme 
immunoassay (EIA) and ultra-performance convergence chromatography tandem mass 
spectrometry (UPC2-MS/MS). Fecal microbial composition was assessed via next 
generation sequencing. EIAs with antibodies raised against progesterone (P4; 
mouse monoclonal - CL425 clone), testosterone (T; rabbit polyclonal), 
corticosterone (B; sheep polyclonal) were utilized. Pregnant females had large 
quantities of fecal progesterone metabolites (FPMs) detected by CL425 EIA. 
Pregnant females also had native P4 and 11α-hydroxydihydroprogesterone 
(11αOHDHP4; 4-pregnen-11α-ol-3,20-dione) detected by UPC2-MS/MS but these 
concentrations were 1000-fold less than the concentrations of FPMs detected by 
the CL425 EIA. By contrast, non-pregnant females had FPM concentrations detected 
by CL425 EIA which were similar to native P4 and 11αOHDHP4 concentrations 
detected by UPC2-MS/MS. Mean fecal androgen metabolite (FAM) concentrations 
detected by the T EIA were similar between males and females. 
11-ketoandrostenedione (11KA4) detected by UPC2-MS/MS was higher in females than 
males. However, there was no difference between males and females in the 
concentration of fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGMs) detected by the B EIA. 
Bacteroidia, followed by Clostridia, was the most abundant classes of fecal 
microbes. The unfiltered microbiome of females was more diverse than that of 
males. The core fecal microbiome of young rhinoceros had a higher observed 
species richness (Shannon diversity index, and Simpson diversity index) than 
that of old rhinoceros. In the alpha male, immobilization was associated with an 
increase in FGMs detected by 11-deoxycortisol (S) detected by UPC2-MS/MS coupled 
with decreased abundance of Spirochaetia. We detected substantially different 
FAM and FPM concentrations from those previously reported for both captive and 
wild white rhinoceros. Comparison of our UPC2-MS/MS and EIA results underscores 
the fact that most EIAs are highly cross reactive for many steroid metabolites. 
Our data also demonstrates a distinct effect of stress not only on FGMs but also 
on the fecal microbiome. This is the first non-invasive assessment of fecal 
steroid metabolites by UPC2-MS/MS and the fecal microbiome in wild white 
rhinoceros.

2019nCoV-101 Study Group(17).

The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
variants has significantly reduced the efficacy of some approved vaccines. A 
fourth dose of NVX-CoV2373 (5 µg SARS-CoV-2 recombinant spike [rS] 
protein + 50 µg Matrix-M™ adjuvant; Novavax, Gaithersburg, MD) was evaluated to 
determine induction of cross-reactive antibodies to variants of concern. A phase 
II randomized study (NCT04368988) recruited participants in Australia and the 
United States to assess a primary series of NVX-CoV2373 followed by two booster 
doses (third and fourth doses at 6-month intervals) in adults 18-84 years of 
age. The primary series was administered when the SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strain 
was prevalent and the third and fourth doses while the Alpha and Delta variants 
were prevalent in AUS and US. Local/systemic reactogenicity was assessed the day 
of vaccination and for 6 days thereafter. Unsolicited adverse events (AEs) were 
reported. Immunogenicity was measured before, and 14 days after, fourth dose 
administration, using anti-spike serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and neutralization 
assays against ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain and Omicron sublineages. Among 1283 
enrolled participants, 258 were randomized to receive the two-dose primary 
series, of whom 104 received a third dose, and 45 received a fourth dose of 
NVX-CoV2373. The incidence of local/systemic reactogenicity events increased 
after the first three doses of NVX-CoV2373 and leveled off after dose 4. 
Unsolicited AEs were reported in 9 % of participants after dose 4 (none of which 
were severe or serious). Anti-rS IgG levels and neutralization antibody titers 
increased following booster doses to a level approximately four-fold higher than 
that observed after the primary series, with a progressively narrowed gap in 
response between the ancestral strain and Omicron BA.5. A fourth dose of 
NVX-CoV2373 enhanced immunogenicity for ancestral and variant SARS-CoV-2 strains 
without increasing reactogenicity, indicating that updates to the vaccine 
composition may not be currently warranted.

Gut microbiota indole-3-propionic acid mediates neuroprotective effect of 
probiotic consumption in healthy elderly: A randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, multicenter trial and in vitro study.

Kim CS(1), Jung S(2), Hwang GS(2), Shin DM(3).

BACKGROUND & AIMS: The beneficial effects of probiotic consumption on 
age-related decline in cerebral function have been previously reported in the 
literature; however, the mechanistic link between gut and brain interactions has 
not yet been fully elucidated. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the role 
of gut microbiota-derived metabolites in gut-brain interactions via blood 
metabolomic profiling analysis in clinical trials and in vitro mechanistic 
studies.
METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical 
trial was conducted in 63 healthy elderly individuals (≥65 years of age). 
Participants were administered either placebo (placebo group, N = 31) or 
probiotic capsules (Bifidobacterium bifidum BGN4 and Bifidobacterium longum 
BORI; probiotics group, N = 32) for 12 weeks. Global and targeted metabolomic 
profiling analyses of their blood samples were then performed using 1H nuclear 
magnetic resonance and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry methods, both at 
baseline and at the end of the trial. Gut microbial analysis was conducted using 
the 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene sequencing method. Subsequently, 
microglial BV2 cells were treated in vitro with indole-3-propionic acid (IPA) 
following lipopolysaccharide stimulation, and neuronal SH-SY5Y cells were 
treated with conditioned media from the BV2 cells. Finally, the levels of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines in BV2 cells and neurotrophins in SH-SY5Y cells were 
quantified using a real-time polymerase chain reaction or enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: The metabolomic profiling analyses showed that probiotic consumption 
significantly altered the levels of metabolites involved in tryptophan 
metabolism (P < 0.01). Among these metabolites, gut microbiota-produced IPA had 
a 1.91-fold increase in the probiotics group (P < 0.05) and showed a significant 
relation to gut bacterial profiles (P < 0.01). Elevated IPA levels were also 
positively associated with the level of serum brain-derived neurotropic factor 
(BDNF) in the probiotics group (r = 0.28, P < 0.05), showing an inverse trend 
compared to the placebo group. In addition, in vitro treatment with IPA (5 μM) 
significantly reduced the concentration of proinflammatory TNF-α in activated 
microglia (P < 0.05), and neuronal cells cultured with conditioned media from 
IPA-treated microglia showed a significant increase in BDNF and nerve growth 
factor production (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: These results show that gut microbiota-produced IPA plays a role in 
protecting the microglia from inflammation, thus promoting neuronal function. 
Therefore, this suggests that IPA is a significant mediator linking the 
interaction between the gut and the brain in the elderly with probiotic 
supplementation.

Therapy with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has dramatically changed the 
natural history of Crohn's disease (CD). However, these drugs are not without 
adverse events, and up to 40% of patients could lose efficacy in the long term. 
We aimed to identify reliable markers of response to anti-TNF drugs in patients 
with CD. A consecutive cohort of 113 anti-TNF naive patients with CD was 
stratified according to clinical response as short-term remission (STR) or 
non-STR (NSTR) at 12 weeks of treatment. We compared the protein expression 
profiles of plasma samples in a subset of patients from both groups prior to 
anti-TNF therapy by SWATH proteomics. We identified 18 differentially expressed 
proteins (p ≤ 0.01, fold change ≥ 2.4) involved in the organization of the 
cytoskeleton and cell junction, hemostasis/platelet function, carbohydrate 
metabolism, and immune response as candidate biomarkers of STR. Among them, 
vinculin was one of the most deregulated proteins (p < 0.001), whose 
differential expression was confirmed by ELISA (p = 0.054). In the multivariate 
analysis, plasma vinculin levels along with basal CD Activity Index, 
corticosteroids induction, and bowel resection were factors predicting NSTR.

SH(11), Hussain G(4), Rasul A(12), Chatha SAS(13), Khan IU(1).

The current study was designed to formulate ternary solid dispersions (TSDs) of 
dexibuprofen (Dex) by solvent evaporation to augment the solubility and 
dissolution profile, in turn providing gastric protection and effective 
anti-inflammatory activity. Initially, nine formulations (S1 to S9) of binary 
solid dispersions (BSDs) were developed. Formulation S1 comprising a 1:1 weight 
ratio of Dex and Syloid 244FP® was chosen as the optimum BSD formulation due to 
its better solubility profile. Afterward, 20 TSD formulations were developed 
using the optimum BSD. The formulation containing Syloid 244FP® with 40% 
Gelucire 48/16® (S18) and Poloxamer 188® (S23) successfully enhanced the 
solubility by 28.23 and 38.02 times, respectively, in pH 6.8, while dissolution 
was increased by 1.99- and 2.01-fold during the first 5 min as compared to pure 
drug. The in vivo gastroprotective study in rats suggested that the average 
gastric lesion index was in the order of pure Dex (8.33 ± 2.02) > S1 (7 ± 1.32) 
> S18 (2.17 ± 1.61) > S23 (1.83 ± 1.04) > control (0). The in vivo 
anti-inflammatory study in rats revealed that the percentage inhibition of 
swelling was in the order of S23 (71.47 ± 2.16) > S18 (64.8 ± 3.79) > S1 (54.14 
± 6.78) > pure drug (18.43 ± 2.21) > control (1.18 ± 0.64) after 6 h. ELISA 
results further confirmed the anti-inflammatory potential of the developed 
formulation, where low levels of IL-6 and TNF alpha were reported for animals 
treated with S23. Therefore, S23 could be considered an effective formulation 
that not only enhanced the solubility and bioavailability but also reduced the 
gastric irritation of Dex.

The amplification of CNS damage in Alzheimer's disease due to SARS-CoV2 
infection.

Nuovo GJ(1), Suster D(2), Sawant D(3), Mishra A(3), Michaille JJ(4), Tili E(5).

Pre-existing Alzheimer's disease is a risk factor for severe/fatal COVID-19 and 
infection by SARS-CoV2 virus has been associated with an increased incidence of 
un-masked Alzheimer's disease. The molecular basis whereby SARS-CoV2 may amplify 
Alzheimer's disease is not well understood. This study analyzed the molecular 
changes in autopsy brain tissues from people with pre-existing dementia who died 
of COVID-19 (n = 5) which was compared to equivalent tissues of people who died 
of COVID-19 with no history of dementia (n = 8), Alzheimer's disease 
pre-COVID-19 (n = 10) and aged matched controls (n = 10) in a blinded fashion. 
Immunohistochemistry analyses for hyperphosphorylated tau protein, α-synuclein, 
and β-amyloid-42 confirmed the diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease (n = 4), and 
Lewy body dementia (n = 1) in the COVID-19 group. The brain tissues from 
patients who died of COVID-19 with no history of dementia showed a diffuse 
microangiopathy marked by endocytosis of spike subunit S1 and S2 in primarily 
CD31+ endothelia with strong co-localization with ACE2, Caspase-3, IL6, TNFα, 
and Complement component 6 that was not associated with SARS-CoV2 RNA. 
Microglial activation marked by increased TMEM119 and MCP1 protein expression 
closely paralleled the endocytosed spike protein. The COVID-19 tissues from 
people with no pre-existing dementia showed, compared to controls, 5-10× fold 
increases in expression of neuronal NOS and NMDAR2 as well as a marked decrease 
in the expression of proteins whose loss is associated with worsening 
Alzheimer's disease: MFSD2a, SHIP1, BCL6, BCL10, and BACH1. In COVID-19 tissues 
from people with dementia the widespread spike-induced microencephalitis with 
the concomitant microglial activation co-existed in the same areas where neurons 
had hyperphosphorylated tau protein suggesting that the already dysfunctional 
neurons were additionally stressed by the SARS-CoV2 induced microangiopathy. 
ACE2+ human brain endothelial cells treated with high dose (but not vaccine 
equivalent low dose) spike S1 protein demonstrated each of the molecular changes 
noted in the in vivo COVID-19 and COVID-19/Alzheimer's disease brain tissues. It 
is concluded that fatal COVID-19 induces a diffuse microencephalitis and 
microglial activation in the brain due to endocytosis of circulating viral spike 
protein that amplifies pre-existing dementia in at least two ways: 1) modulates 
the expression of proteins that may worsen Alzheimer's disease and 2) stresses 
the already dysfunctional neurons by causing an acute 
proinflammatory/hypercoagulable/hypoxic microenvironment in areas with abundant 
hyperphosphorylated tau protein and/or βA-42.

Synthesis and Inhibitory Activity of Machaeridiol-Based Novel Anti-MRSA and 
Anti-VRE Compounds and Their Profiling for Cancer-Related Signaling Pathways.

M(2), Bennett MM(1), Zhang J(1), Carr MA(3), Lovell KM(3), Wellington OI(3),

Three unique 5,6-seco-hexahydrodibenzopyrans (seco-HHDBP) machaeridiols A−C, 
reported previously from Machaerium Pers., have displayed potent activities 
against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant 
Enterococcus faecium, and E. faecalis (VRE). In order to enrich the pipeline of 
natural product-derived antimicrobial compounds, a series of novel 
machaeridiol-based analogs (1−17) were prepared by coupling stemofuran, 
pinosylvin, and resveratrol legends with monoterpene units R-(−)-α-phellandrene, 
(−)-p-mentha-2,8-diene-1-ol, and geraniol, and their inhibitory activities were 
profiled against MRSA ATCC 1708, VRE ATCC 700221, and cancer signaling pathways. 
Compounds 5 and 11 showed strong in vitro activities with MIC values of 2.5 
μg/mL and 1.25 μg/mL against MRSA, respectively, and 2.50 μg/mL against VRE, 
while geranyl analog 14 was found to be moderately active (MIC 5 μg/mL). The 
reduction of the double bonds of the monoterpene unit of compound 5 resulted in 
17, which had the same antibacterial potency (MIC 1.25 μg/mL and 2.50 μg/mL) as 
its parent, 5. Furthermore, a combination study between seco-HHDBP 17 and HHDBP 
machaeriol C displayed a synergistic effect with a fractional inhibitory 
concentrations (FIC) value of 0.5 against MRSA, showing a four-fold decrease in 
the MIC values of both 17 and machaeriol C, while no such effect was observed 
between vancomycin and 17. Compounds 11 and 17 were further tested in vivo 
against nosocomial MRSA at a single intranasal dose of 30 mg/kg in a murine 
model, and both compounds were not efficacious under these conditions. Finally, 
compounds 1−17 were profiled against a panel of luciferase genes that assessed 
the activity of complex cancer-related signaling pathways (i.e., transcription 
factors) using T98G glioblastoma multiforme cells. Among the compounds tested, 
the geranyl-substituted analog 14 exhibited strong inhibition against several 
signaling pathways, notably Smad, Myc, and Notch, with IC50 values of 2.17 μM, 
1.86 μM, and 2.15 μM, respectively. In contrast, the anti-MRSA actives 5 and 17 
were found to be inactive (IC50 > 20 μM) across the panel of these 
cancer-signaling pathways.

Anti-obesity effect of Lythri herba water extracts in vitro and in vivo.

Park YJ(1), Kim HY(2), Shin S(3), Lee J(4), Heo I(5), Cha YY(6), An HJ(7).

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Lythrum salicaria L., also called purple 
loosestrife, has traditionally been used as a medicinal plant to treat internal 
dysfunction, such as gastrointestinal disorders or hemorrhages. It contains 
numerous phytochemical compounds, including orientin, and has been reported to 
have anti-diarrheal, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antimicrobial 
properties.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The effects of Lythrum salicaria L. on obesity have not been 
explored. Therefore, we investigated the anti-obesity effects of Lythri Herba, 
the aerial part of this plant, in vitro and in vivo.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using distilled water, Lythri Herba water extracts (LHWE) 
were prepared by extracting Lythri Herba at 100°Ϲ. The contents of orientin in 
LHWE were identified using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) 
analysis. To evaluate the anti-obesity effect of LHWE, 3T3-L1 adipocytes and a 
high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice were used. Oil-red O staining was performed to 
examine the anti-adipogenic effects of LHWE in vitro. The histological changes 
in epididymal white adipose tissue (epiWAT) by LHWE were examined using 
hematoxylin and eosin staining. Serum leptin levels were measured by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Specific quantification kits measured total 
cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the serum. The relative fold induction of 
protein and mRNA was determined using western blot and Quantitative real-time 
Polymerase Chain Reaction analysis, respectively.
RESULTS: HPLC analysis demonstrated the presence of orientin in LHWE. LHWE 
treatment markedly reduced lipid accumulation in differentiated 3T3-L1 
adipocytes. LHWE administration also conferred resistance to HFD-induced weight 
gain in mice and reduced epiWAT mass. Mechanistically, LHWE significantly 
decreased lipogenesis by downregulating lipoprotein lipase (LPL), 
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, ATP-citrate lyase, fatty acid synthase, 
stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, sterol regulatory element binding transcription 
factor 1, and carbohydrate response element binding protein expression and 
increased the expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation (FAO), 
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 
1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and epiWAT. Furthermore, LHWE significantly up-regulated 
the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and 
epiWAT.
CONCLUSION: LHWE decreases white adipogenesis in vitro and HFD-induced weight 
gain in vivo, which is associated with reduced lipogenesis and enhanced FAO.

Transcriptome Analysis of Co-Cultures of THP-1 Human Macrophages with 
Inactivated Germinated Trichophyton rubrum Conidia.

Although most mycoses are superficial, the dermatophyte Trichophyton rubrum can 
cause systemic infections in patients with a weakened immune system, resulting 
in serious and deep lesions. The aim of this study was to analyze the 
transcriptome of a human monocyte/macrophage cell line (THP-1) co-cultured with 
inactivated germinated T. rubrum conidia (IGC) in order to characterize deep 
infection. Analysis of macrophage viability by lactate dehydrogenase 
quantification showed the activation of the immune system after 24 h of contact 
with live germinated T. rubrum conidia (LGC). After standardization of the 
co-culture conditions, the release of the interleukins TNF-α, IL-8, and IL-12 
was quantified. The greater release of IL-12 was observed during co-culturing of 
THP-1 with IGC, while there was no change in the other cytokines. 
Next-generation sequencing of the response to T. rubrum IGC identified the 
modulation of 83 genes; of these, 65 were induced and 18 were repressed. The 
categorization of the modulated genes showed their involvement in signal 
transduction, cell communication, and immune response pathways. In total, 16 
genes were selected for validation and Pearson's correlation coefficient was 
0.98, indicating a high correlation between RNA-seq and qPCR. Modulation of the 
expression of all genes was similar for LGC and IGC co-culture; however, the 
fold-change values were higher for LGC. Due to the high expression of the IL-32 
gene in RNA-seq, we quantified this interleukin and observed an increased 
release in co-culture with T. rubrum. In conclusion, the macrophages-T. rubrum 
co-culture model revealed the ability of these cells to modulate the immune 
response, as demonstrated by the release of proinflammatory cytokines and the 
RNA-seq gene expression profile. The results obtained permit to identify 
possible molecular targets that are modulated in macrophages and that could be 
explored in antifungal therapies involving the activation of the immune system.

L(1), Tüzün B(5), Taskin-Tok T(6)(7), Taslimi P(8).

In this study, the therapeutic potential and phytochemical composition of 
ethanolic extract of Cephalaria elazigensis var. purpurea (CE), an endemic 
species, were investigated. For this purpose, the antiproliferative effect of CE 
on the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line was evaluated by 
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, and 
its effectiveness on colony formation and cell migration was analyzed with 
clonogenic assay and wound healing assay, respectively. In addition, the cell 
death detection ELISA (CDDE) assay was conducted to determine the pro-apoptotic 
capacity of CE. The IC50 value of the CE was determined as 324.2 ± 14.7 µg/mL. 
Furthermore, upon 1000 µg/mL CE treatment, there was 4.96-fold increase in the 
population of cells undergoing apoptosis compared to the untreated control 
cells. The antioxidant activity tests were performed by DPPH free radical, ABTS 
cation radical, ferric-ion reducing power (FRAP) and ferrous-ion chelating power 
(FCAP) assays. Antioxidant activity values for the DPPH, ABTS and FRAP assays 
were found to be 125.6 ± 6.3, 34.09 ± 0.1 and 123.4 ± 4.2 µmol TE/mg DE, 
respectively. We further determined the effect of CE ethanolic extract against 
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) enzymes. CE plays 
an effective inhibitory role in AChE and BuChE (AChE: IC50: 10.54 µg/mL, BuChE: 
IC50: 6.84 µg/mL) respectively. Further, molecular docking stuy was conducted to 
understand the nature of the all compound against AChE an BChE. It is revealed 
that α-Linolenic acid shows lowest binding energy (-7.90 kcal/mol) towards AChE, 
on the other side, Linoleic acid shows good binding affinity (-7.40 kcal/mol) 
for BChE.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

Multi-DNA Adduct and Abasic Site Quantitation In Vivo by Nano-Liquid 
Chromatography/High-Resolution Orbitrap Tandem Mass Spectrometry: Methodology 
for Biomonitoring Colorectal DNA Damage.

Konorev D, Yao L, Turesky RJ.

Epidemiological and mechanistic studies suggest that processed and red meat 
consumption and tobacco smoking are associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) 
risk. Several classes of carcinogens, including N-nitroso compounds (NOCs) in 
processed meats and heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) and polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons (PAHs) in grilled meats and tobacco smoke, undergo metabolism to 
reactive intermediates that may form mutation-inducing DNA adducts in the 
colorectum. Heme iron in red meat may contribute to oxidative DNA damage and 
endogenous NOC formation. However, the chemicals involved in colorectal DNA 
damage and the paradigms of CRC etiology remain unproven. There is a critical 
need to establish physicochemical methods for identifying and quantitating DNA 
damage induced by genotoxicants in the human colorectum. We established robust 
nano-liquid chromatography/high-resolution accurate mass Orbitrap tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC/HRAMS2) methods to measure DNA adducts of nine meat and 
tobacco-associated carcinogens and lipid peroxidation products in the liver, 
colon, and rectum of carcinogen-treated rats employing fresh-frozen and 
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. Some NOCs form 
O6-carboxymethyl-2'-deoxyguanosine, O6-methyl-2'-deoxyguanosine, and unstable 
quaternary N-linked purine/pyrimidine adducts, which generate 
apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites. AP sites were quantitated following 
derivatization with O-(pyridin-3-yl-methyl)hydroxylamine. DNA adduct 
quantitation was conducted with stable isotope-labeled internal standards, and 
method performance was validated for accuracy and reproducibility. Limits of 
quantitation ranged from 0.1 to 1.1 adducts per 108 bases using 3 μg of DNA. 
Adduct formation in animals ranged from ∼1 in 108 to ∼1 in 105 bases, occurring 
at comparable levels in fresh-frozen and FFPE specimens for most adducts. AP 
sites increased by 25- to 75-fold in the colorectum and liver, respectively. 
Endogenous lipid peroxide-derived 
3-(2-deoxy-β-d-erythro-pentofuranosyl)pyrimido[1,2-α]purin-10(3H)-one (M1dG) and 
6-oxo-M1dG adduct levels were not increased by carcinogen dosing but increased 
in FFPE tissues. Human biomonitoring studies can implement LC/HRAMS2 assays for 
DNA adducts and AP sites outlined in this work to advance our understanding of 
CRC etiology.

Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) controls growth by regulating 
anabolic and catabolic processes in response to environmental cues, including 
nutrients1,2. Amino acids signal to mTORC1 through the Rag GTPases, which are 
regulated by several protein complexes, including GATOR1 and GATOR2. GATOR2, 
which has five components (WDR24, MIOS, WDR59, SEH1L and SEC13), is required for 
amino acids to activate mTORC1 and interacts with the leucine and arginine 
sensors SESN2 and CASTOR1, respectively3-5. Despite this central role in 
nutrient sensing, GATOR2 remains mysterious as its subunit stoichiometry, 
biochemical function and structure are unknown. Here we used cryo-electron 
microscopy to determine the three-dimensional structure of the human GATOR2 
complex. We found that GATOR2 adopts a large (1.1 MDa), two-fold symmetric, 
cage-like architecture, supported by an octagonal scaffold and decorated with 
eight pairs of WD40 β-propellers. The scaffold contains two WDR24, four MIOS and 
two WDR59 subunits circularized via two distinct types of junction involving 
non-catalytic RING domains and α-solenoids. Integration of SEH1L and SEC13 into 
the scaffold through β-propeller blade donation stabilizes the GATOR2 complex 
and reveals an evolutionary relationship to the nuclear pore and 
membrane-coating complexes6. The scaffold orients the WD40 β-propeller dimers, 
which mediate interactions with SESN2, CASTOR1 and GATOR1. Our work reveals the 
structure of an essential component of the nutrient-sensing machinery and 
provides a foundation for understanding the function of GATOR2 within the mTORC1 
pathway.

Impact of Protein Content on the Antioxidants, Anti-Inflammatory Properties and 
Glycemic Index of Wheat and Wheat Bran.

Jimenez-Pulido IJ(1), Daniel R(1), Perez J(2), Martínez-Villaluenga C(3), De 
Luis D(4), Martín Diana AB(1).

Conventional wheat milling generates important volumes of wheat bran (WB), which 
is a concentrated source of polyphenols and insoluble fiber. In terms of health 
benefits and based on epidemiological and experimental evidence, these compounds 
contribute to reducing the risk of certain chronic pathologies. Protein 
concentration is the main quality factor conditioning wheat use in the 
agroindustry. When turning waste into feasible resources, it is essential to 
evaluate the variability of the raw material. The aim of this study was the 
evaluation of the impact of protein content in the valorization of WB based on 
its antioxidants, anti-inflammatory properties and glycemic index (GI). A 
significantly (p ≤ 0.05) lower content of phenolic compounds was found in the 
whole grain (WG) fractions, both free (FP) and bound (BP), as compared to the WB 
phenolic fractions, differences that ranged from 4- to 6-fold (538 to 561 mg GAE 
100 g-1 in WG vs. 1027 to 1236 in WB mg GAE 100 g-1 in FP and 2245 to 2378 vs. 
6344 to 7232 mg GAE 100 g-1 in BP). A significant (p ≤ 0.05) effect of the 
protein content on the resulting phenolic content and antioxidant capacity was 
observed, especially in WG, but also in WB, although in the latter a significant 
(p ≤ 0.05) negative correlation was observed, and increasing the protein content 
resulted in decreasing total phenolic content, antioxidants, and ferric-reducing 
capacities, probably due to their different types of proteins. The highest 
protein content in WB produced a significant (p ≤ 0.05) reduction in GI value, 
probably due to the role of protein structure in protecting starch from 
gelatinization, along with phytic acid, which may bind to proteins closely 
associated to starch and chelate calcium ions, required for α-amylase activity. 
A significant (p ≤ 0.05) effect of the protein content on the GI was also found, 
which may be explained by the structural effect of the proteins associated with 
starch, reducing the GI (21.64). The results obtained show the importance of 
segregation of WB in valorization strategies in order to increase the efficiency 
of the processes.

Accommodating heterogeneous missing data patterns for prostate cancer risk 
prediction.

L(6), De Hoedt AM(3), Liss MA(7), Leach RJ(8), Boorjian SA(9), Cooperberg 
MR(10), Poyet C(11), Saba K(11)(12), Herkommer K(13), Meissner VH(13), Vickers 
AJ(14), Ankerst DP(15)(16).

BACKGROUND: We compared six commonly used logistic regression methods for 
accommodating missing risk factor data from multiple heterogeneous cohorts, in 
which some cohorts do not collect some risk factors at all, and developed an 
online risk prediction tool that accommodates missing risk factors from the 
end-user.
METHODS: Ten North American and European cohorts from the Prostate Biopsy 
Collaborative Group (PBCG) were used for fitting a risk prediction tool for 
clinically significant prostate cancer, defined as Gleason grade group ≥ 2 on 
standard TRUS prostate biopsy. One large European PBCG cohort was withheld for 
external validation, where calibration-in-the-large (CIL), calibration curves, 
and area-underneath-the-receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) were 
evaluated. Ten-fold leave-one-cohort-internal validation further validated the 
optimal missing data approach.
RESULTS: Among 12,703 biopsies from 10 training cohorts, 3,597 (28%) had 
clinically significant prostate cancer, compared to 1,757 of 5,540 (32%) in the 
external validation cohort. In external validation, the available cases method 
that pooled individual patient data containing all risk factors input by an 
end-user had best CIL, under-predicting risks as percentages by 2.9% on average, 
and obtained an AUC of 75.7%. Imputation had the worst CIL (-13.3%). The 
available cases method was further validated as optimal in internal 
cross-validation and thus used for development of an online risk tool. For 
end-users of the risk tool, two risk factors were mandatory: serum 
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and age, and ten were optional: digital rectal 
exam, prostate volume, prior negative biopsy, 5-alpha-reductase-inhibitor use, 
prior PSA screen, African ancestry, Hispanic ethnicity, first-degree prostate-, 
breast-, and second-degree prostate-cancer family history.
CONCLUSION: Developers of clinical risk prediction tools should optimize use of 
available data and sources even in the presence of high amounts of missing data 
and offer options for users with missing risk factors.

Peptide Conjugates Derived from flg15, Pep13, and PIP1 That Are Active against 
Plant-Pathogenic Bacteria and Trigger Plant Defense Responses.

Gil-Caballero S(3), Badosa E(2), Bonaterra A(2), Montesinos E(2), Feliu L(1), 
Planas M(1).

Thirty peptide conjugates were designed by combining an antimicrobial peptide 
(BP16, BP100, BP143, KSL-W, BP387, or BP475) at the N- or C-terminus of a plant 
defense elicitor peptide (flg15, BP13, Pep13, or PIP1). These conjugates were 
highly active in vitro against six plant-pathogenic bacteria, especially against 
Xanthomonas arboricola pv. pruni, Xanthomonas fragariae and Xanthomonas 
axonopodis pv. vesicatoria. The most active peptides were those incorporating 
Pep13. The order of the conjugation influenced the antibacterial activity and 
the hemolysis. Regarding the former, peptide conjugates incorporating the 
elicitor peptide flg15 or Pep13 at the C-terminus were, in general, more active 
against Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae and P. syringae pv. syringae, 
whereas those bearing these elicitor peptides at the N-terminus displayed higher 
activity against Erwinia. amylovora and the Xanthomonas species. The best 
peptide conjugates displayed MIC values between 0.8 and 12.5 μM against all the 
bacteria tested and also had low levels of hemolysis and low phytotoxicity. 
Analysis of the structural and physicochemical parameters revealed that a 
positive charge ranging from +5 to +7 and a moderate hydrophobic 
moment/amphipathic character is required for an optimal biological profile. 
Interestingly, flg15-BP475 exhibited a dual activity, causing the upregulation 
of the same genes as flg15 and reducing the severity of bacterial spot in tomato 
plants with a similar or even higher efficacy than copper oxychloride. 
Characterization by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of the secondary structure 
of flg15-BP475 showed that residues 10 to 25 fold into an α-helix. This study 
establishes trends to design new bifunctional peptides useful against plant 
diseases caused by plant-pathogenic bacteria. IMPORTANCE The consequences of 
plant pathogens on crop production together with the lack of effective and 
environmentally friendly pesticides evidence the need of new agents to control 
plant diseases. Antimicrobial and plant defense elicitor peptides have emerged 
as good candidates to tackle this problem. This study focused on combining these 
two types of peptides into a single conjugate with the aim to potentiate the 
activity of the individual fragments. Differences in the biological activity of 
the resulting peptide conjugates were obtained depending on their charge, 
amphipathicity, and hydrophobicity, as well as on the order of the conjugation 
of the monomers. This work provided bifunctional peptide conjugates able to 
inhibit several plant-pathogenic bacteria, to stimulate plant defense responses, 
and to reduce the severity of bacterial spot in tomato plants. Thus, this study 
could serve as the basis for the development of new antibacterial/plant defense 
elicitor peptides to control bacterial plant pathogens.

Anti-Inflammatory Effect of Ethanolic Extract from Tabebuia rosea (Bertol.) DC., 
Quercetin, and Anti-Obesity Drugs in Adipose Tissue in Wistar Rats with 
Diet-Induced Obesity.

Barrios-Nolasco A(1), Domínguez-López A(2), Miliar-García A(2), Cornejo-Garrido 
J(1), Jaramillo-Flores ME(3).

Obesity is characterized by the excessive accumulation of fat, which triggers a 
low-grade chronic inflammatory process. Currently, the search for compounds with 
anti-obesogenic effects that help reduce body weight, as well as associated 
comorbidities, continues. Among this group of compounds are plant extracts and 
flavonoids with a great diversity of action mechanisms associated with their 
beneficial effects, such as anti-inflammatory effects and/or as signaling 
molecules. In the bark of Tabebuia rosea tree, there are different classes of 
metabolites with anti-inflammatory properties, such as quercetin. Therefore, the 
present work studied the effect of the ethanolic extract of T. rosea and 
quercetin on the mRNA of inflammation markers in obesity compared to the drugs 
currently used. Total RNA was extracted from epididymal adipose tissue of 
high-fat diet-induced obese Wistar rats treated with orlistat, phentermine, T. 
rosea extract, and quercetin. The rats treated with T. rosea and quercetin 
showed 36 and 31% reductions in body weight compared to the obese control, and 
they likewise inhibited pro-inflammatory molecules: Il6, Il1b, Il18, Lep, Hif1a, 
and Nfkb1 without modifying the expression of Socs1 and Socs3. Additionally, 
only T. rosea overexpressed Lipe. Both T. rosea and quercetin led to a reduction 
in the expression of pro-inflammatory genes, modifying signaling pathways, which 
led to the regulation of the obesity-inflammation state.

Identification of Candidate Chemosensory Gene Families by Head Transcriptomes 
Analysis in the Mexican Fruit Fly, Anastrepha ludens Loew (Diptera: 
Tephritidae).

Sánchez-Galicia F(6).

Insect chemosensory systems, such as smell and taste, are mediated by 
chemosensory receptor and non-receptor protein families. In the last decade, 
many studies have focused on discovering these families in Tephritidae species 
of agricultural importance. However, to date, there is no information on the 
Mexican fruit fly Anastrepha ludens Loew, a priority pest of quarantine 
importance in Mexico and other countries. This work represents the first effort 
to identify, classify and characterize the six chemosensory gene families by 
analyzing two head transcriptomes of sexually immature and mature adults of A. 
ludens from laboratory-reared and wild populations, respectively. We identified 
120 chemosensory genes encoding 31 Odorant-Binding Proteins (OBPs), 5 
Chemosensory Proteins (CSPs), 2 Sensory Neuron Membrane Proteins (SNMPs), 42 
Odorant Receptors (ORs), 17 Ionotropic Receptors (IRs), and 23 Gustatory 
Receptors (GRs). The 120 described chemosensory proteins of the Mexican fruit 
fly significantly contribute to the genetic databases of insects, particularly 
dipterans. Except for some OBPs, this work reports for the first time the 
repertoire of olfactory proteins for one species of the genus Anastrepha, which 
provides a further basis for studying the olfactory system in the family 
Tephritidae, one of the most important for its economic and social impact 
worldwide.

M(6)(7), Siebes M(8), Christiansen EH(2), Van de Hoef T(1), Piek J(1).

BACKGROUND: Coronary angiography alone is insufficient to identify lesions 
associated with myocardial ischemia that may benefit from revascularization. 
Coronary physiology parameters may improve clinical decision making in addition 
to coronary angiography, but the association between 2D and 3D qualitative 
coronary angiography (QCA) and invasive pressure and flow measurements is yet to 
be elucidated.
METHODS: We associated invasive fractional flow reserve (FFR), coronary flow 
reserve (CFR) and coronary flow capacity (CFC) with 2D- and 3D-QCA in 430 
intermediate lesions of 366 patients.
RESULTS: Overall, 2D-QCA analysis resulted in less severe stenosis severity 
compared with 3D-QCA analysis. FFR+/CFR- lesions had similar 3D-QCA 
characteristics as FFR+/CFR+ lesions. In contrast, vessels with FFR-/CFR+ 
discordance had 3D-QCA characteristics similar to those of vessels with 
concordant FFR-/CFR-. Contrarily, FFR+/CFR- lesions had CFC similar to that of 
as FFR-/CFR- lesions.
CONCLUSIONS: Non-flow-limiting lesions (FFR+/CFR-) have 3D-QCA characteristics 
similar to those of FFR+/CFR+, but the majority are not associated with 
inducible myocardial ischemia as determined by invasive CFC. FFR-/CFR+ lesions 
have 3D-QCA characteristics similar to those of FFR-/CFR- lesions but are more 
frequently associated with a moderately to severely reduced CFC, illustrating 
the angiographic-functional mismatch in discordant lesions.

HIV-1 Drug Resistance Assay Using Ion Torrent Next Generation Sequencing and 
On-Instrument End-to-End Analysis Software.

Pyne MT(1), Simmon KE(1), Mallory MA(1), Hymas WC(1), Stevenson J(1), Barker 
AP(1)(2), Hillyard DR(1)(2).

HIV-1 antiretroviral therapy management requires sequencing the protease, 
reverse transcriptase, and integrase portions of the HIV-1 pol gene. Most 
resistance testing is performed with Sanger sequencing, which has limited 
ability to detect minor variants. Next generation sequencing (NGS) platforms 
enable variant detection at frequencies as low as 1% allowing for earlier 
detection of resistance and modification of therapy. Implementation of NGS 
assays in the clinical laboratory is hindered by complicated assay design, 
cumbersome wet bench procedures, and the complexity of data analysis and 
bioinformatics. We developed a complete NGS protocol and companion analysis and 
reporting pipeline using AmpliSeq multiplex PCR, Ion Torrent S5 XL sequencing, 
and Stanford's HIVdb resistance algorithm. Implemented as a Torrent Suite 
software plugin, the pipeline runs automatically after sequencing. An optimum 
variant frequency threshold of 10% was determined by comparing Sanger sequences 
of archived samples from ViroSeq testing, resulting in a sensitivity of 98.2% 
and specificity of 99.0%. The majority (91%) of drug resistance mutations were 
detected by both Sanger and NGS, with 1.7% only by Sanger and 7.3% only by NGS. 
Variant calls were highly reproducible and there was no cross-reactivity to VZV, 
HBV, CMV, EBV, and HCV. The limit of detection was 500 copies/mL. The NGS assay 
performance was comparable to ViroSeq Sanger sequencing and has several 
advantages, including a publicly available end-to-end analysis and reporting 
plugin. The assay provides a straightforward path for implementation of NGS for 
HIV drug resistance testing in the laboratory setting without additional 
investment in bioinformatics infrastructure and resources.

Soybean is a rich source of folates. We optimised the extraction and detection 
of folates from soybean seeds by HPLC-MS/MS and analysed the folate content and 
composition of 1074 accessions. Total folate content ranged from 64.51 to 
691.24 μg/100 g fresh weight, with 10-fold variation, and 60 elite accessions 
with over 400 μg/100 g of total folate were identified. The most abundant 
component was 5-CHO-H4folate, which accounted for an average of 60% of total 
folate content. Seed-coat colour, seed weight, ecoregion, and accession type 
significantly affected soybean folate content. Furthermore, 5-CH3-H4folate 
correlated positively with seed protein (r = 0.24***) and negatively with oil 
(r = -0.26***). The geographical distribution of folate according to accession 
origin revealed that accessions from Northeast China contain higher amounts of 
total folate and 5-CHO-H4folate. This study provides comprehensive and novel 
insights into the folate profile of soybean, which will benefit soybean breeding 
for folate enhancement.

WO(3)/Ag/ZnO S-scheme heterostructure thin film spinning disc photoreactor for 
intensified photodegradation of cephalexin antibiotic.

Zamani S(1), Rahimi MR(2), Ghaedi M(3), Dashtian K(4).

The presence of antibiotics in wastes and drinking water has led to serious 
environmental and health concerns, further necessitating the development of an 
advanced sustainable strategy to eliminate antibiotics from aquatic media. In 
this context, the present research reports the successful fabrication of a 
spinning disc photoreactor (SDPR) supported ZnO/Ag/WO3 S-scheme 
visible-light-driven thin-film photocatalyst to study the degradation of 
cephalexin (CPX) as a target pollutant under blue light irradiation. The 
optical, electrochemical and physicochemical characterization of the as-prepared 
thin-film samples were carried out by XRD, top-view FE-SEM, EDS-mapping, 
UV-Vis-DRS, contact angle, EIS, transient photocurrent, mott Schottky and AFM 
techniques. The rod shape morphology of the samples with moderate surface 
roughness, desirable hydrophobicity, low bandgap and remarkable band structure 
alignment confirmed the applicability of as-prepared thin-film with an average 
photon flux of 1.94 × 10-4-8.61 × 10-5 E's m-2 s-1. The use of a rotating 
catalytic disc impressively declined the photon propagation distance, 
decremented the probability of light absorption by the solution, and intensified 
the mass transfer rate. The maximum throughputs of 98.8% efficiencies for CPX 
degradation were achieved at a rotational speed of 180 rpm, the solution flow 
rate of 1.0 L min-1, the light intensity of 11 mW cm-2, and initial CPX 
concentration of 40 mg L-1, illumination time of 80 min, and pH of 6. Damkohler 
number (Da) value was found to be 1.23 × 10-2 at the optimum conditions, 
indicating the negligibility of the external mass transfer resistance in the 
SDPR. The photocatalytic mechanism was elucidated for finding the most operative 
radical species, suggesting the crucial role of ·O2- in photodegradation of CPX 
and a drastic improvement of the charge separation by S-scheme heterostructure 
and facilitation by Ag mediator. Findings indicated that the developed reusable

F(7)(3), Beach SR(7)(3), McCoy TH Jr(7)(3)(8).

BACKGROUND: The reduction of physical restraint utilization in the hospital 
setting is a key goal of high-quality care, but little is known about the rate 
of restraint use in general hospitals in the USA.
OBJECTIVE: This study reports the rate of physical restraint coding among acute 
care hospital discharges in the USA and explores associated demographic and 
diagnostic factors.
DESIGN: The National Inpatient Sample, a de-identified all-payors database of 
acute care hospital discharges in the USA, was queried for patients aged 18 and 
older with a diagnosis code for physical restraint status in 2019.
PARTICIPANTS: Hospitalized patients aged 18 and older.
MAIN MEASURES: Demographics, discharge diagnoses, in-hospital mortality, length 
of stay, total hospital charges.
KEY RESULTS: In total, 220,470 (95% CI: 208,114 to 232,826) hospitalizations, or 
0.7% of overall hospitalizations, included a discharge code for physical 
restraint status. There was a 700-fold difference in coding for restraint 
utilization based on diagnosis, with 7.4% of patients with encephalitis 
receiving restraint diagnosis codes compared to < 0.01% of patients with 
uncomplicated diabetes. In an adjusted model, male sex was associated with an 
odds ratio of 1.4 (95% CI: 1.4 to 1.5) for restraint utilization coding, and 
Black race was associated with an odds ratio of 1.3 (95% CI: 1.2 to 1.4) 
relative to white race.
CONCLUSIONS: In the general hospital setting, there is variability in physical 
restraint coding by sex, race, and clinical diagnosis. More research is needed 
into the appropriate utilization of restraints in the hospital setting and 
possible inequities in restraint utilization.

A multicomponent intranasal adjuvant drives durable humoral, cellular, and 
mucosal immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in young and aged mice.

Multiple FDA-approved SARS-CoV-2 vaccines provide excellent protection against 
severe disease. Despite this, immunity can wane relatively fast, particularly in 
the elderly and novel viral variants capable of evading infection- and 
vaccination-induced immunity continue to emerge. Intranasal (IN) vaccination 
more effectively induces mucosal immune responses than parenteral vaccines, 
which would improve protection and reduce viral transmission. Here, we developed 
a rationally designed IN adjuvant consisting of a combined nanoemulsion 
(NE)-based adjuvant and an RNA-based RIG-I agonist (IVT DI) to drive more 
robust, broadly protective antibody and T cell responses. We previously 
demonstrated this combination adjuvant (NE/IVT) potently induces protective 
immunity through synergistic activation of an array of innate receptors. We now 
demonstrate that NE/IVT with the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD), 
induces robust and durable humoral, mucosal, and cellular immune responses of 
equivalent magnitude and quality in young and aged mice. This contrasted with 
the MF59-like intramuscular adjuvant, Addavax, which showed a marked decrease in 
immunogenicity with age. Robust antigen-specific IFNγ/IL-2/TNF-α was induced in 
both young and aged NE/IVT-immunized animals, which is significant as their 
reduced production is associated with suboptimal protective immunity in the 
elderly. These findings highlight the potential of adjuvanted mucosal vaccines 
for improving protection against COVID-19.

Predictive capacity of COVID-19-related risk beliefs on weight management 
behaviors on a commercial weight loss program and speed of COVID-19 vaccination 
uptake: prospective cohort study.

Ho AS(1), Mitchell ES(1), Lee J(2), Steptoe A(3), Behr H(1)(4), May CN(5), 
Michaelides A(1).

BACKGROUND: Recent work has shown that obesity may be a risk factor for severe 
COVID-19. However, it is unclear to what extent individuals have heard or 
believe this risk factor information, and how these beliefs may predict their 
preventive behaviors (e.g., weight management behaviors or COVID-19 preventive 
behaviors). Previous work has primarily looked at overall risk likelihood 
perceptions (i.e., not about obesity as a risk factor) within general 
populations of varying weight and concentrated on COVID-19-related preventive 
behaviors. Therefore, this prospective cohort study explored whether beliefs 
about obesity as a risk factor and overall risk likelihood perceptions predicted 
weight management and COVID-19 preventive behaviors over the next 16 weeks in 
individuals with obesity or overweight.
METHODS: Participants were 393 individuals in the US who joined a commercial 
weight management program in January, 2021. We leveraged the mobile program's 
automatic measurement of real-time engagement in weight management behaviors 
(e.g., steps taken), while surveys measured risk beliefs at baseline as well as 
when individuals received COVID-19 vaccination doses (asked monthly) over the 
next 16 weeks. Mixed effects models predicted engagement and weight loss each 
week for 16 weeks, while ordinal logistic regression models predicted the month 
that individuals got vaccinated against COVID-19.
RESULTS: We found that belief in obesity as a risk factor at baseline 
significantly predicted greater engagement (e.g., steps taken, foods logged) in 
program-measured weight management behaviors over the next 16 weeks in models 
adjusted for baseline BMI, age, gender, and local vaccination rates (minimally 
adjusted) and in models additionally adjusted for demographic factors. Belief in 
obesity as a risk factor at baseline also significantly predicted speed of 
COVID-19 vaccination uptake in minimally adjusted models but not when 
demographic factors were taken into account. Exposure to obesity risk factor 
information at baseline predicted greater engagement over 16 weeks in minimally 
adjusted models.
CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the potential utility of effective education 
to increase individuals' belief in obesity risk factor information and 
ultimately promote engagement or faster vaccination. Future research should 
investigate to what extent the results generalize to other populations.

Ehrlich H(4), Tay FR(5), Niu LN(6).

The use of RNA as therapeutic agents is a visionary idea in contemporary 
medicine. Some forms of RNA can modulate the immune response of the host to 
enhance tissue regeneration events such as osteogenesis. Herein, RNA molecules 
commercially available for immunomodulatory applications (imRNA) were used to 
prepare biomaterials for bone regeneration. The polyanionic imRNA stabilized 
calcium phosphate ionic clusters to produce imRNA-ACP that had the capacity to 
mineralize the intrafibrillar compartments of collagen fibrils. For the first 
time, it was shown that incorporating imRNA-ACP into collagen scaffolds resulted 
in rapid new bone formation in cranial defects of mice. Both in vivo and in 
vitro results demonstrated that macrophage polarization was highly-sensitive to 
the imRNA-ACP containing collagen scaffolds. Macrophages were polarized into the 
anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype that produced anti-inflammation cytokines and 
growth factors. The favorable osteoimmunological microenvironment created by the 
scaffolds prevented their immunorejection and facilitated osteogenesis. The 
potential of RNA in creating immunomodulatory biomaterials has been 
underestimated in the past. The overall aim of this study was to explore the 
potential application of imRNA-based biomaterials in bone tissue engineering, 
with the competitive edge of facile synthesis and excellent biocompatibility. 
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: In this work, commercially available RNA extracted 
from bovine spleens for immunomodulatory applications (imRNA) were used to 
stabilize amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) and induce mineralization within 
collagen fibrils. Incorporation of imRNA-ACP into collagen scaffolds regenerated 
new bone in-situ. Because of its immunomodulatory effects, the imRNA-ACP that 
was incorporated into collagen scaffolds modulated the local immune environment 
of murine cranial defects by altering the macrophage phenotype through 
JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. The novelty of this work existed in the discovery 
of RNA's potential in creating immunomodulatory biomaterials. With the 
competitive edge of facile synthesis and excellent biocompatibility, the 
imRNA-based biomaterials are potentially useful for future bone tissue 
engineering applications.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron BA.2 
sub-lineage has gained in proportion relative to BA.1. Because spike (S) protein 
variations may underlie differences in their pathobiology, here we determine 
cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the BA.2 S ectodomain and 
compare these with previously determined BA.1 S structures. BA.2 
receptor-binding domain (RBD) mutations induce remodeling of the RBD structure, 
resulting in tighter packing and improved thermostability. Interprotomer RBD 
interactions are enhanced in the closed (or 3-RBD-down) BA.2 S, while the fusion 
peptide is less accessible to antibodies than in BA.1. Binding and pseudovirus 
neutralization assays reveal extensive immune evasion while defining epitopes of 
two outer RBD face-binding antibodies, DH1044 and DH1193, that neutralize both 
BA.1 and BA.2. Taken together, our results indicate that stabilization of the 
closed state through interprotomer RBD-RBD packing is a hallmark of the Omicron 
variant and show differences in key functional regions in the BA.1 and BA.2 S 
proteins.

Cerebral cortical encephalitis (CCE) is a recently described myelin 
oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) phenotype. In 
this observational retrospective study, we characterized 19 CCE patients (6.7% 
of our MOGAD cohort). Headache (n = 15, 79%), seizures (n = 13, 68%), and 
encephalopathy (n = 12, 63%) were frequent. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed 
unilateral (n = 12, 63%) or bilateral (n = 7, 37%) cortical T2 hyperintensity 
and leptomeningeal enhancement (n = 17, 89%). N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor 
autoantibodies coexisted in 2 of 15 tested (13%). CCE pathology (n = 2) showed 
extensive subpial cortical demyelination (n = 2), microglial reactivity (n = 2), 
and inflammatory infiltrates (perivascular, n = 1; meningeal, n = 1). Most 
received high-dose steroids (n = 17, 89%), and all improved, but 3 had CCE 
relapses. This study highlights the CCE spectrum and provides insight into its 
pathogenesis. ANN NEUROL 2023;93:297-302.

to CART cell therapy in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

BACKGROUND: Chimeric antigen receptor T (CART) cell therapy targeting the B cell 
specific differentiation antigen CD19 has shown clinical efficacy in a subset of 
relapsed/refractory (r/r) diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients. 
Despite this heterogeneous response, blood pre-infusion biomarkers predicting 
responsiveness to CART cell therapy are currently understudied.
METHODS: Blood cell and serum markers, along with clinical data of DLBCL 
patients who were scheduled for CART cell therapy were evaluated to search for 
biomarkers predicting CART cell responsiveness.
FINDINGS: Compared to healthy controls (n=24), DLBCL patients (n=33) showed 
significant lymphopenia, due to low CD3+CD4+ T helper and CD3-CD56+ NK cell 
counts, while cytotoxic CD3+CD8+ T cell counts were similar. Although 
lymphopenic, DLBCL patients had significantly more activated HLA-DR+ (P=0.005) 
blood T cells and a higher frequency of differentiated CD3+CD27-CD28- (28.7 ± 
19.0% versus 6.6 ± 5.8%; P<0.001) T cells. Twenty-six patients were infused with 
CART cells (median 81 days after leukapheresis) and were analyzed for the 
overall response (OR) 3 months later. Univariate and multivariate regression 
analyses showed that low levels of differentiated CD3+CD27-CD28- T cells (23.3 ± 
19.3% versus 35.1 ± 18.0%) were independently associated with OR. This 
association was even more pronounced when patients were stratified for complete 
remission (CR versus non-CR: 13.7 ± 11.7% versus 37.7 ± 17.4%, P=0.001). A 
cut-off value of ≤ 18% of CD3+CD27-CD28- T cells predicted CR at 12 months with 
high accuracy (P<0.001). In vitro, CD3+CD8+CD27-CD28- compared to 
CD3+CD8+CD27+CD28+ CART cells displayed similar CD19+ target cell-specific 
cytotoxicity, but were hypoproliferative and produced less cytotoxic cytokines 
(IFN-γ and TNF-α). CD3+CD8+ T cells outperformed CD3+CD4+ T cells 3- to 6-fold 
in terms of their ability to kill CD19+ target cells.
INTERPRETATION: Low frequency of differentiated CD3+CD27-CD28- T cells at 
leukapheresis represents a novel pre-infusion blood biomarker predicting a 
favorable response to CART cell treatment in r/r DLBCL patients.

response in rheumatoid arthritis.

Szabo Z(7), Rojkovich B(8), Merkely B(4)(5), Nagy G(1)(2)(3)(4).

BACKGROUND: To investigate the factors that have significant impact on the 
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and 
vaccination induced immune response in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: Serological response was measured by quantifying anti-SARS-CoV-2 
specific antibodies, while the cell-mediated response was measured by a 
whole-blood test quantifying the interferon (IFN)-γ response to different 
SARS-CoV-2-specific domains.
RESULTS: We prospectively enrolled 109 RA patients and 43 healthy controls. The 
median time (IQR) between the confirmed infection or the last vaccination dose 
and the day when samples were taken ("sampling interval") was 3.67 (2.03, 5.50) 
months in the RA group. Anti-Spike (anti-S) specific antibodies were detected in 
94% of RA patients. Among the investigated patient related variables, age 
(p<0.004), sampling interval (p<0.001), the brand of the vaccine (p<0.001) and 
targeted RA therapy (TNF-inhibitor, IL-6 inhibitor, anti-CD20 therapy) had 
significant effect on the anti-S levels. After covariate adjustment 
TNF-inhibitor therapy decreased the anti-S antibody concentrations by 80% 
(p<0.001). The same figures for IL-6 inhibitor and anti-CD20 therapy were 74% 
(p=0.049) and 97% (p=0.002), respectively. Compared to subjects who were 
infected but were not vaccinated, the RNA COVID-19 vaccines increased the anti-S 
antibody levels to 71.1 (mRNA-1273) and 36.0 (BNT162b2) fold (p<0.001). The 
corresponding figure for the ChAdOx1s vaccine is 18.1(p=0.037). Anti-CCP 
(anti-cyclic citrullinated peptides) positive patients had 6.28 times (p= 
0.00165) higher anti-S levels, than the anti-CCP negative patients. Positive 
T-cell response was observed in 87% of the healthy volunteer group and in 52% of 
the RA patient group. Following vaccination or infection it declined 
significantly (p= 0.044) but more slowly than that of anti-S titer (6%/month 
versus 25%). Specific T-cell responses were decreased by 65% in patients treated 
with anti-CD20 therapy (p=0.055).
CONCLUSION: Our study showed that the SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody levels were 
substantially reduced in RA patients treated with TNF-α-inhibitors (N=51) and 
IL-6-inhibitor (N=15). In addition, anti-CD20 therapy (N=4) inhibited both 
SARS-CoV-2-induced humoral and cellular immune responses. Furthermore, the 
magnitude of humoral and cellular immune response was dependent on the age and 
decreased over time. The RNA vaccines and ChAdOx1s vaccine effectively increased 
the level of anti-S antibodies.

BACKGROUND: Limited data are available on the long-term clinical and immunologic 
consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection in people with HIV (PWH).
METHODS: We measured SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral and cellular responses in 
people with and without HIV recovering from COVID-19 ( n  = 39 and n  = 43, 
respectively) using binding antibody, surrogate virus neutralization, 
intracellular cytokine staining, and inflammatory marker assays. We identified 
individuals experiencing postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) and 
evaluated immunologic parameters. We used linear regression and generalized 
linear models to examine differences by HIV status in the magnitude of 
inflammatory and virus-specific antibody and T-cell responses, as well as 
differences in the prevalence of PASC.
RESULTS: Among PWH, we found broadly similar SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody and 
T-cell responses as compared with a well matched group of HIV-negative 
individuals. PWH had 70% lower relative levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD8 
+ T cells ( P  = 0.007) and 53% higher relative levels of PD-1+ 
SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 + T cells ( P  = 0.007). Higher CD4 + /CD8 + ratio was 
associated with lower PD-1 expression on SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 + T cells 
(0.34-fold effect, P  = 0.02). HIV status was strongly associated with PASC 
(odds ratio 4.01, P  = 0.008), and levels of certain inflammatory markers (IL-6, 
TNF-alpha, and IP-10) were associated with persistent symptoms.
CONCLUSION: We identified potentially important differences in 
SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in PWH and HIV-negative participants 
that might have implications for long-term immunity conferred by natural 
infection. HIV status strongly predicted the presence of PASC. Larger and more 
detailed studies of PASC in PWH are urgently needed.

Characterization of a New Glucose-Tolerant GH1 β-Glycosidase from Aspergillus 
fumigatus with Transglycosylation Activity.

Concern over environmental impacts has spurred many efforts to replace fossil 
fuels with biofuels such as ethanol. However, for this to be possible, it is 
necessary to invest in other production technologies, such as second generation 
(2G) ethanol, in order to raise the levels of this product and meet the growing 
demand. Currently, this type of production is not yet economically feasible, due 
to the high costs of the enzyme cocktails used in saccharification stage of 
lignocellulosic biomass. In order to optimize these cocktails, the search for 
enzymes with superior activities has been the goal of several research groups. 
For this end, we have characterized the new β-glycosidase AfBgl1.3 from A. 
fumigatus after expression and purification in Pichia pastoris X-33. Structural 
analysis by circular dichroism revealed that increasing temperature destructured 
the enzyme; the apparent Tm value was 48.5 °C. The percentages of α-helix 
(36.3%) and β-sheet (12.4%) secondary structures at 25 °C were predicted. 
Biochemical characterization suggested that the optimal conditions for AfBgl1.3 
were pH 6.0 and temperature of 40 °C. At 30 and 40 °C, the enzyme was stable and 
retained about 90% and 50% of its activity, respectively, after pre-incubation 
for 24 h. In addition, the enzyme was highly stable at pH between 5 and 8, 
retaining over 65% of its activity after pre-incubation for 48 h. AfBgl1.3 
co-stimulation with 50-250 mM glucose enhanced its specific activity by 1.4-fold 
and revealed its high tolerance to glucose (IC50 = 2042 mM). The enzyme was 
active toward the substrates salicin (495.0 ± 49.0 U mg-1), pNPG (340.5 ± 18.6 U 
mg-1), cellobiose (89.3 ± 5.1 U mg-1), and lactose (45.1 ± 0.5 U mg-1), so it 
had broad specificity. The Vmax values were 656.0 ± 17.5, 706.5 ± 23.8, and 
132.6 ± 7.1 U mg-1 toward p-nitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (pNPG), 
D-(-)-salicin, and cellobiose, respectively. AfBgl1.3 displayed 
transglycosylation activity, forming cellotriose from cellobiose. The addition 
of AfBgl1.3 as a supplement at 0.9 FPU/g of cocktail Celluclast® 1.5L increased 
carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) conversion to reducing sugars (g L-1) by about 26% 
after 12 h. Moreover, AfBgl1.3 acted synergistically with other Aspergillus 
fumigatus cellulases already characterized by our research group-CMC and 
sugarcane delignified bagasse were degraded, releasing more reducing sugars 
compared to the control. These results are important in the search for new 
cellulases and in the optimization of enzyme cocktails for saccharification.

Hypoxia Attenuates Colonic Innate Immune Response and Inhibits TLR4/NF-κB 
Signaling Pathway in Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Colonic Epithelial Injury Mice.

High altitude hypoxia can lead to a spectrum of gastrointestinal problems. As 
the first line of host immune defense, innate immune response in the intestinal 
mucosa plays a pivotal role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and protecting 
against intestinal injury at high altitude. This study aimed to investigate the 
effect of hypoxia on the colonic mucosal barrier and toll-like receptor 4 
(TLR4)-mediated innate immune responses in the colon. The mice were exposed to a 
hypobaric chamber to simulate a 5,000 m plateau environment for 7 days, and the 
colonic mucosa changes were recorded. At the same time, the inflammation model 
was established by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to explore the effects of hypoxia on 
the TLR4/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway and its downstream 
inflammatory factors [tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and 
interferon (IFN)-γ] in the colon. We found that hypoxic exposure caused weight 
loss and structural disturbance of the colonic mucosa in mice. Compared with the 
control group, the protein levels of TLR4 [fold change (FC) = 0.75 versus 
FC = 0.23], MyD88 (FC = 0.80 versus FC = 0.30), TIR-domain-containing adaptor 
protein inducing interferon-β (TRIF: FC = 0.89 versus FC = 0.38), and NF-κB p65 
(FC = 0.75 versus FC = 0.24) in the colon of mice in the hypobaric hypoxia group 
were significantly decreased. LPS-induced upregulation of the TLR4/NF-κB 
signaling and its downstream inflammatory factors was inhibited by hypoxia. 
Specifically, compared with the LPS group, the protein levels of TLR4 
(FC = 1.18, FC = 0.86), MyD88 (FC = 1.20, FC = 0.80), TRIF (FC = 1.20, 
FC = 0.86), and NF-κB p65 (FC = 1.29, FC = 0.62) and the mRNA levels of IL-1β 
(FC = 7.38, FC = 5.06), IL-6 (FC = 16.06, FC = 9.22), and IFN-γ (FC = 2.01, 
FC = 1.16) were reduced in the hypobaric hypoxia plus LPS group. Our findings 
imply that hypoxia could lead to marked damage of the colonic mucosa and a 
reduction of TLR4-mediated colonic innate immune responses, potentially reducing 
host defense responses to colonic pathogens.

BACKGROUND: Cross-neutralizing capacity of antibodies against severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants is important in 
mitigating (re-)exposures. Role of antibody maturation, the process whereby 
selection of higher affinity antibodies augments host immunity, to determine 
SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing capacity was investigated.
METHODS: Sera from SARS-CoV-2 convalescents at 2, 6, or 10 months postrecovery, 
and BNT162b2 vaccine recipients at 3 or 25 weeks postvaccination, were analyzed. 
Anti-spike IgG avidity was measured in urea-treated ELISAs. Neutralizing 
capacity was assessed by surrogate neutralization assays. Fold change between 
variant and wild-type neutralization inferred the breadth of neutralizing 
capacity.
RESULTS: Compared with early-convalescent, avidity indices of late-convalescent 
sera were significantly higher (median, 37.7 [interquartile range 28.4-45.1] vs 
64.9 [57.5-71.5], P < .0001). Urea-resistant, high-avidity IgG best predicted 
neutralizing capacity (Spearman r = 0.49 vs 0.67 [wild-type]; 0.18-0.52 vs 
0.48-0.83 [variants]). Higher-avidity convalescent sera better cross-neutralized 
SARS-CoV-2 variants (P < .001 [Alpha]; P < .01 [Delta and Omicron]). Vaccinees 
only experienced meaningful avidity maturation following the booster dose, 
exhibiting rather limited cross-neutralizing capacity at week 25.
CONCLUSIONS: Avidity maturation was progressive beyond acute recovery from 
infection, or became apparent after the booster vaccine dose, granting broader 
anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing capacity. Understanding the maturation kinetics of 
the 2 building blocks of anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral immunity is crucial.

Multivalency, autoinhibition, and protein disorder in the regulation of 
interactions of dynein intermediate chain with dynactin and the nuclear 
distribution protein.

C(1), Vesely CH(1), Barbar EJ(1).

As the only major retrograde transporter along microtubules, cytoplasmic dynein 
plays crucial roles in the intracellular transport of organelles and other 
cargoes. Central to the function of this motor protein complex is dynein 
intermediate chain (IC), which binds the three dimeric dynein light chains at 
multivalent sites, and dynactin p150Glued and nuclear distribution protein 
(NudE) at overlapping sites of its intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain. 
The disorder in IC has hindered cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray 
crystallography studies of its structure and interactions. Here we use a suite 
of biophysical methods to reveal how multivalent binding of the three light 
chains regulates IC interactions with p150Glued and NudE. Using IC from 
Chaetomium thermophilum, a tractable species to interrogate IC interactions, we 
identify a significant reduction in binding affinity of IC to p150Glued and a 
loss of binding to NudE for constructs containing the entire N-terminal domain 
as well as for full-length constructs when compared to the tight binding 
observed with short IC constructs. We attribute this difference to 
autoinhibition caused by long-range intramolecular interactions between the 
N-terminal single α-helix of IC, the common site for p150Glued, and NudE 
binding, and residues closer to the end of the N-terminal domain. Reconstitution 
of IC subcomplexes demonstrates that autoinhibition is differentially regulated 
by light chains binding, underscoring their importance both in assembly and 
organization of IC, and in selection between multiple binding partners at the 
same site.

Plain Language Summary: Motor proteins are the freight trains of the cell, 
transporting large molecular cargo from one location to another using an array 
of ‘roads’ known as microtubules. These hollow tubes are oriented, with one 
extremity (the plus-end) growing faster than the other (the minus-end). While 
over 40 different motor proteins travel towards the plus-end of microtubules, 
just one is responsible for moving cargo in the opposite direction. This 
protein, called dynein, performs a wide range of functions which must be 
carefully regulated, often through changes in the shape and interactions of 
various dynein segments. The intermediate chain is one of the essential subunits 
that form dynein, and it acts as a binding site for a range of molecular actors. 
In particular, it connects the three other dynein subunits (known as the light 
chains) to the dynein heavy chain containing the motor domain. It also binds to 
two non-dynein proteins: NudE, which helps to organise microtubules, and the 
p150Glued region of dynactin, a protein required for dynein activity. Despite 
their distinct roles, p150Glued and NudE attach to the same region of the 
intermediate chain, a highly flexible ‘unstructured’ segment which is difficult 
to study. How the binding of p150Glued and NudE is regulated has therefore 
remained unsolved. In response, Jara et al. decided to investigate how the three 
dynein light chains may help to control interactions between the intermediate 
chain and non-dynein proteins. They used more stable versions of dynein, NudE 
and dynactin (from a fungus that grows at high temperatures) to produce the 
various subcomplexes formed by the intermediate chain, the three dynein light 
chains, and parts of p150Glued and NudE. A suite of biophysical techniques was 
applied to study these structures, as they are challenging to capture using 
traditional approaches. This revealed that the unstructured region of the 
intermediate chain can fold back on itself, bringing together its two 
extremities; such folding blocks the p150Glued and NudE binding site. This 
obstruction is cleared when the light chains bind to the intermediate chain, 
demonstrating how these three subunits can regulate dynein activity. In humans, 
mutations in dynein are associated with a range of serious neurological and 
muscular diseases. The work by Jara et al. brings new insight into the way this 
protein works; more importantly, it describes how to combine several biophysical 
techniques to study non-structured proteins, offering a blueprint that is likely 
to be relevant for a wide range of scientists.

IMPORTANCE: Cutaneous disease in dermatomyositis has no standardized treatment 
approach and so presents a challenging task for patients and clinicians.
OBJECTIVE: To study the efficacy and safety of apremilast as an add-on therapy 
in patients with recalcitrant cutaneous dermatomyositis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This phase 2a, open-label, single-arm 
nonrandomized controlled trial was conducted at a single center from June 2018 
to June 2021. Participants were 8 patients with recalcitrant cutaneous 
dermatomyositis, defined by a cutaneous disease activity severity index (CDASI) 
score greater than 5 despite treatment with steroids, steroid-sparing agents, or 
both. Data were analyzed from June 2018 to June 2021.
INTERVENTIONS: Apremilast 30 mg orally twice daily was added to ongoing 
treatment regimens.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the overall response rate 
(ORR) at 3 months. Key secondary outcomes were the safety and toxicity of 
apremilast and the durability of response at 6 months. The CDASI, muscle score, 
dermatology life quality index (DLQI), and depression assessments were performed 
at baseline and regularly until month 7. Skin biopsies were performed at 
baseline and 3 months after apremilast (defined as 3 months into active 
apremilast therapy) and tested for gene expression profiling and 
immunohistochemical stains. Adverse events were assessed using the Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0.
RESULTS: Among 8 patients with recalcitrant cutaneous dermatomyositis (all 
women; mean [SD] age, 54 [15.9] years), a response was found at 3 months after 
apremilast among 7 patients (ORR, 87.5%). The mean (SD) decrease in CDASI was 
12.9 (6.3) points at 3 months (P < .001). Apremilast was well tolerated, with no 
grade 3 or higher adverse events. Sequencing of RNA was performed on skin 
biopsies taken from 7 patients at baseline and at 3 months after therapy. 
Appropriate negative (ie, no primary antibody) and positive (ie, tonsil and 
spleen) controls were stained in parallel with each set of slides studied. Of 
39 076 expressed genes, there were 195 whose expression changed 2-fold or more 
at P < .01 (123 downregulated and 72 upregulated genes). Gene set enrichment 
analysis identified 13 pathways in which apremilast was associated with 
downregulated expression, notably signal transducers and activators of 
transcription 1 (STAT1), STAT3, interleukin 4 (IL-4), IL-6, IL-12, IL-23, 
interferon γ (IFNγ), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) pathways. In 
immunohistochemical staining, there was a mean (SD) decrease in phosphorylation 
levels STAT1 (22.3% [28.3%] positive cells) and STAT3 (13.4% [11.6%] positive 
cells) at the protein level, a downstream signaling pathway for the 
downregulated cytokines.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that apremilast was a safe and 
efficacious add-on treatment in recalcitrant dermatomyositis, with an overall 
response rate of 87.5% and associations with downregulation of multiple 
inflammatory pathways.

Nicotine promotes vascular calcification via intracellular Ca2+-mediated, 
Nox5-induced oxidative stress, and extracellular vesicle release in vascular 
smooth muscle cells.

AIMS: Smokers are at increased risk of cardiovascular events. However, the exact 
mechanisms through which smoking influences cardiovascular disease resulting in 
accelerated atherosclerosis and vascular calcification are unknown. The aim of 
this study was to investigate effects of nicotine on initiation of vascular 
smooth muscle cell (VSMC) calcification and to elucidate underlying mechanisms.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed vascular calcification of 62 carotid lesions of 
both smoking and non-smoking patients using ex vivo micro-computed tomography 
(µCT) scanning. Calcification was present more often in carotid plaques of 
smokers (n = 22 of 30, 73.3%) compared to non-smokers (n = 11 of 32, 34.3%; 
P < 0.001), confirming higher atherosclerotic burden. The difference was 
particularly profound for microcalcifications, which was 17-fold higher in 
smokers compared to non-smokers. In vitro, nicotine-induced human primary VSMC 
calcification, and increased osteogenic gene expression (Runx2, Osx, BSP, and 
OPN) and extracellular vesicle (EV) secretion. The pro-calcifying effects of 
nicotine were mediated by Ca2+-dependent Nox5. SiRNA knock-down of Nox5 
inhibited nicotine-induced EV release and calcification. Moreover, pre-treatment 
of hVSMCs with vitamin K2 ameliorated nicotine-induced intracellular oxidative 
stress, EV secretion, and calcification. Using nicotinic acetylcholine receptor 
(nAChR) blockers α-bungarotoxin and hexamethonium bromide, we found that the 
effects of nicotine on intracellular Ca2+ and oxidative stress were mediated by 
α7 and α3 nAChR. Finally, we showed that Nox5 expression was higher in carotid 
arteries of smokers and correlated with calcification levels in these vessels.
CONCLUSION: In this study, we provide evidence that nicotine induces 
Nox5-mediated pro-calcific processes as novel mechanism of increased 
atherosclerotic calcification. We identified that activation of α7 and α3 nAChR 
by nicotine increases intracellular Ca2+ and initiates calcification of hVSMCs 
through increased Nox5 activity, leading to oxidative stress-mediated EV 
release. Identifying the role of Nox5-induced oxidative stress opens novel 
avenues for diagnosis and treatment of smoking-induced cardiovascular disease.

The humoral immune response against severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern elicited by vaccination 
was evaluated in COVID-19 recovered individuals (Rec) separated 1-3 months 
(Rec2m) or 4-12 months (Rec9m) postinfection and compared to the response in 
naïve participants. Antibody-mediated immune responses were assessed in 66 
participants by three commercial immunoassays and a SARS-CoV-2 lentiviral-based 
pseudovirus neutralization assay. Immunoglobulin (Ig) levels against SARS-CoV-2 
spike were lower in naïve participants after two doses than in Rec after a 
single dose (p < 0.05). After two doses in Rec, levels of total Ig to 
receptor-binding domain were significantly increased in Rec9m compared to Rec2m 
(p < 0.001). The neutralizing potency observed in Rec9m was consistently higher 
than in Rec2m against variants of concern (VOCs) Alpha, Beta, Delta, and BA.1 
sublineage of Omicron with 2.2-2.8-fold increases. Increasing the interval 
between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the vaccination with messenger RNA-based 
vaccines to more than 3 months generates a more efficient heterologous humoral 
immune response against VOCs by allowing enough time to mount a strong recall 
memory B cell response.

PURPOSE: Periodontitis and coronavirus disease (COVID-19) share risk factors and 
activate similar immunopathological pathways, intensifying systemic 
inflammation. This study investigated the clinical, immunological and 
microbiological parameters in individuals with COVID-19 and controls, exploring 
whether periodontitis-driven inflammation contributes to worsening COVID-19 
endpoints.
METHODS: Case (positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2) and control (negative RT-PCR) 
individuals underwent clinical and periodontal assessments. Salivary levels of 
TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-10, OPG, RANKL, neutrophil extracellular traps, and 
subgingival biofilm were analyzed at two timepoints. Data on COVID-19-related 
outcomes and comorbidity information were evaluated from medical records.
RESULTS: Ninety-nine cases of COVID-19 and 182 controls were included for 
analysis. Periodontitis was associated with more hospitalization (p = 0.009), 
more days in the intensive care unit (ICU) (p = 0.042), admission to the 
semi-ICU (p = 0.047), and greater need for oxygen therapy (p = 0.042). After 
adjustment for confounders, periodontitis resulted in a 1.13-fold increase in 
the chance of hospitalization. Salivary IL-6 levels (p = 0.010) were increased 
in individuals with COVID-19 and periodontitis. Periodontitis was associated 
with increased RANKL and IL-1β after COVID-19. No significant changes were 
observed in the bacterial loads of the periodontopathogens Porphyromona 
gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Tanerella forsythia, and 
Treponema denticola.
CONCLUSIONS: Periodontitis was associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes, 
suggesting the relevance of periodontal care to reduce the burden of overall 
inflammation. Understanding the crosstalk between SARS-CoV-2 infection and 
chronic conditions such as periodontitis that can influence disease outcome is 
important to potentially prevent complications of COVID-19.

Circulating sTREM-1 as a predictive biomarker of pediatric multisystemic 
inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C).

The exacerbation of the inflammatory response caused by SARS-CoV-2 in adults 
promotes the production of soluble mediators that could act as diagnostic and 
prognostic biomarkers for COVID-19. Among the potential biomarkers, the soluble 
triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cell-1 (sTREM-1) has been described as 
a predictor of inflammation severity. The aim was to evaluate sTREM-1 and 
cytokine serum concentrations in pediatric patients during the acute and 
convalescent phases of COVID-19. This was a prospective study that included 53 
children/adolescents with acute COVID-19 (Acute-CoV group); 54 who recovered 
from COVID-19 (Post-CoV group) and 54 controls (Control group). Preexisting 
chronic conditions were present in the three groups, which were defined as 
follows: immunological diseases, neurological disorders, and renal and hepatic 
failures. The three groups were matched by age, sex, and similar preexisting 
chronic conditions. No differences in sTREM-1 levels were detected among the 
groups or when the groups were separately analyzed by preexisting chronic 
conditions. However, sTREM-1 analysis in the seven multisystemic inflammatory 
syndrome children (MIS-C) within the Acute-Cov group showed that sTREM-1 
concentrations were higher in MIS-C vs non-MIS-C acute patients. Then, the 
receiver operating curve analysis (ROC) performed with MIS-C acute patients 
revealed a significant AUC of 0.870, and the sTREM-1 cutoff value 
of > 5781 pg/mL yielded a sensitivity of 71.4 % and a specificity of 91.3 % for 
disease severity, and patients with sTREM-1 levels above this cutoff presented 
an elevated risk for MIS-C development in 22.85-fold (OR = 22.85 [95 % CI 
1.64-317.5], p = 0.02). The cytokine analyses in the acute phase revealed that 
IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 concentrations were elevated regardless of whether the 
patient developed MIS-C, and those levels decreased in the convalescent phase, 
even when compared with controls. Spearman correlation analysis generated 
positive indexes between sTREM-1 and IL-12 and TNF-α concentrations, only within 
the Acute-CoV group. Our findings revealed that sTREM-1 in pediatric patients 
has good predictive accuracy as an early screening tool for surveillance of 
MIS-C cases, even in patients with chronic underlying conditions.

The association of hyperketonemia with fecal and rumen microbiota at time of 
diagnosis in a case-control cohort of early lactation cows.

Miles AM(1)(2), McArt JAA(3), Lima SF(4), Neves RC(5), Ganda E(6).

BACKGROUND: Many dairy cows experience a state of energy deficit as they 
transition from late gestation to early lactation. The aims of this study were 
to 1) determine if the development of hyperketonemia in early lactation dairy 
cows is indicated by their gut microbiome, and 2) to identify microbial features 
which may inform health status. We conducted a prospective nested case-control 
study in which cows were enrolled 14 to 7 days before calving and followed 
through their first 14 days in milk (DIM). Hyperketonemic cows (HYK, n = 10) 
were classified based on a blood β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentration 
1.2 mmol/L within their first 14 DIM. For each HYK cow, two non-HYK (CON, 
n = 20) cows were matched by parity and 3 DIM, with BHB < 1.2 mmol/L. Daily 
blood BHB measures were used to confirm CON cows maintained their healthy 
status; some CON cows displayed BHB 1.2 mmol/L after matching and these cows 
were reclassified as control-HYK (C-HYK, n = 9). Rumen and fecal samples were 
collected on the day of diagnosis or matching and subjected to 16S rRNA 
profiling.
RESULTS: No differences in taxa abundance, or alpha and beta diversity, were 
observed among CON, C-HYK, and HYK health groups for fecal microbiomes. Similar 
microbiome composition based on beta diversity analysis was detected for all 
health statuses, however the rumen microbiome of CON and HYK cows were found to 
be significantly different. Interestingly, highly similar microbiome composition 
was observed among C-HYK cow rumen and fecal microbiomes, suggesting that these 
individual animals which initially appear healthy with late onset of 
hyperketonemia were highly similar to each other. These C-HYK cows had 
significantly lower abundance of Ruminococcus 2 in their rumen microbiome 
compared to CON and HYK groups. Multinomial regressions used to compute log-fold 
changes in microbial abundance relative to health status were not found to have 
predictive value, therefore were not useful to identify the role of certain 
microbial features in predicting health status.
CONCLUSIONS: Lower relative abundance of Ruminococcus 2 in C-HYK cow rumens was 
observed, suggesting these cows may be less efficient at degrading cellulose 
although the mechanistic role of Ruminococcus spp. in rumen metabolism is not 
completely understood. Substantial differences in fecal or rumen microbiomes 
among cows experiencing different levels of energy deficit were not observed, 
suggesting that hyperketonemia may not be greatly influenced by gut microbial 
composition, and vice versa. Further studies using higher resolution -omics 
approaches like meta-transcriptomics or meta-proteomics are needed to decipher 
the exact mechanisms at play.

Analyzing the Impact of Mobile App Engagement on Mental Health Outcomes: 
Secondary Analysis of the Unwinding Anxiety Program.

Nardi W(1), Roy A(1), Dunsiger S(1), Brewer J(1).

BACKGROUND: App-based interventions provide a promising avenue for mitigating 
the burden on mental health services by complimenting therapist-led treatments 
for anxiety. However, it remains unclear how specific systems' use of app 
features may be associated with changes in mental health outcomes (eg, anxiety 
and worry).
OBJECTIVE: This study was a secondary analysis of engagement data from a stage 1 
randomized controlled trial testing the impact of the Unwinding Anxiety mobile 
app among adults with generalized anxiety disorder. The aims of this study were 
2-fold: to investigate whether higher microengagement with the primary 
intervention feature (ie, educational modules) is associated with positive 
changes in mental health outcomes at 2 months (ie, anxiety, worry, interoceptive 
awareness, and emotional reactivity) and to investigate whether the use of 
adjunctive app features is also associated with changes in mental health 
outcomes.
METHODS: We analyzed the intervention group during the stage 1 trial of the 
Unwinding Anxiety mobile app. The total use of specific mobile app features and 
the use specific to each feature were calculated. We used multivariate linear 
models with a priori significance of α=.05 to investigate the impact of 
cumulative app use on anxiety, worry, interoceptive awareness, and emotional 
regulation at 2 months, controlling for baseline scores, age, and education 
level in all models. Significant relationships between system use metrics and 
baseline participant characteristics were assessed for differences in use 
groupings using between-group testing (ie, 2-tailed t tests for continuous data 
and chi-square analyses for categorical data).
RESULTS: The sample was primarily female (25/27, 93%), and the average age was 
42.9 (SD 15.6) years. Educational module completion, the central intervention 
component, averaged 20.2 (SD 11.4) modules out of 32 for the total sample. 
Multivariate models revealed that completing >75% of the program was associated 
with an average 22.6-point increase in interoceptive awareness (b=22.6; SE 8.32; 
P=.01; 95% CI 5.3-39.8) and an 11.6-point decrease in worry (b=-11.6; SE 4.12; 
P=.01; 95% CI -20.2 to -3.1). In addition, a single log unit change in the total 
number of meditations was associated with a 0.62-point reduction in the 
Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale scores (b=0.62; SE 0.27; P=.005; 95% CI 
-1.2 to -0.6), whereas a single log unit use of the stress meter was associated 
with an average of a 0.5-point increase in emotional regulation scores (Five 
Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire; b=0.5; SE 0.21; P=.03; 95% CI 0.1-0.9).
CONCLUSIONS: This study offers a clearer understanding of the impact of 
engagement with app features on broader engagement with the health outcomes of 
interest. This study highlights the importance of comprehensive investigations 
of engagement during the development of evidence-based mobile apps.

Impact of sex and age on adherence to guidelines in non-small cell lung cancer 
management.

Paakkola NM(1), Lindqvist J(2), Jekunen A(3), Sihvo E(4), Johansson M(5), 
Andersén H(6).

INTRODUCTION: Age-related disparities in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
treatment are well known, but few studies have assessed the impact of sex on 
treatment disparities. Disparities in guideline-adherence may explain the 
superior survival in women with NSCLC. Therefore, we aimed to define patient- 
and tumor-related factors associated with non-adherence to guidelines in NSCLC 
management with a special focus on sex and age.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with NSCLC who received first-line treatment at 
the Vaasa Central Hospital between 2016 and 2020 were included in the study. The 
primary outcome was guideline adherence, defined as adherent, undertreatment, or 
overtreatment considering performance status. A binary logistic regression model 
was used to calculate the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for non-adherence to 
treatment guidelines depending on patient- and tumor-related factors.
RESULTS: 321 patients were included in the study. Non-adherence was highest in 
≥75-year-old women (41.3%), followed by ≥75-year-old men (32.6%), <75-year-old 
men (27.6%) and lowest in women <75-year-old (19.7%) (p = 0.035). Non-adherent 
care consisted more often of undertreatment in <75-year-old men than women 
(26.0% versus 12.1%) and overtreatment in <75-year-old women than men (7.6% 
versus 1.6%). Non-adherence was associated with stage III disease (aOR 2.21; 95% 
CI 1.07-4.59), poor pulmonary function (aOR 3.69, 95% CI 1.56-8.71), and 
Charlson Comorbidity Index 1-2 (aOR 2.09; 95% CI 1.09-4.01).
CONCLUSION: Sex- and age-related disparities in guideline adherence were 
observed in <75-year-old men and in ≥75-year-olds. Stage III NSCLC was 
associated with non-adherence.

The Omicron (B.1.1.529) SARS-CoV-2 variant contains an unusually high number of 
mutations in the spike protein, raising concerns of escape from vaccines, 
convalescent serum, and therapeutic drugs. Here, we analyzed the degree to which 
Omicron pseudo-virus evades neutralization by serum or therapeutic antibodies. 
Serum samples obtained 3 months after two doses of BNT162b2 vaccination 
exhibited 18-fold lower neutralization titers against Omicron than parental 
virus. Convalescent serum samples from individuals infected with the Alpha and 
Delta variants allowed similar frequencies of Omicron breakthrough infections. 
Domain-wise analysis using chimeric spike proteins revealed that this efficient 
evasion was primarily achieved by mutations clustered in the receptor binding 
domain but that multiple mutations in the N-terminal domain contributed as well. 
Omicron escaped a therapeutic cocktail of imdevimab and casirivimab, whereas 
sotrovimab, which targets a conserved region to avoid viral mutation, remains 
effective. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) decoys are another 
virus-neutralizing drug modality that are free, at least in theory, from 
complete escape. Deep mutational analysis demonstrated that an engineered ACE2 
molecule prevented escape for each single-residue mutation in the receptor 
binding domain, similar to immunized serum. Engineered ACE2 neutralized Omicron 
comparably to the Wuhan strain and also showed a therapeutic effect against 
Omicron infection in hamsters and human ACE2 transgenic mice. Similar to 
previous SARS-CoV-2 variants, some sarbecoviruses showed high sensitivity 
against engineered ACE2, confirming the therapeutic value against diverse 
variants, including those that are yet to emerge.

progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.

BACKGROUND: Current diagnosis tools for prostate cancer (PCa) such as serum PSA 
detection and prostate biopsy cannot distinguish dormant tumors from invasive 
malignancies, either be used as prognosis marker for castration resistant 
prostate cancer (CRPC), the lethal stage of PCa patients. Exosomes have been 
widely investigated as promising biomarkers for various diseases. We aim to 
characterize the proteomic and metabolomic profile of exosomes and to evaluate 
their potential value for the diagnosis of PCa, especially CRPC. We also 
investigate the functions of some specific exosome biomarkers in the progression 
of CRPC.
METHODS: Integrated proteomics and metabolomics analysis were performed for 
plasma-derived exosomes collected from tumor-free controls (TFC), PCa and CRPC 
patients. Expression of specific exosomal proteins were further validated by 
targeted 4D-parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) mass spectrometry among the three 
cohorts. Tissue distribution and functional role of exosomal protein LRG1 was 
studied in clinical PCa tissue samples and cell line models.
RESULTS: Three potential exosomal protein markers were identified. The 
apolipoprotein E level in PCa samples was 1.7-fold higher than that in TFC 
(receiver operating characteristic value, 0.74). Similarly, the levels of 
exosome-derived leucine-rich alpha2-glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) and 
inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H3 (ITIH3) in the CRPC group were 1.7 
and 2.04 times, respectively, higher than those in the PCa group (ROC values, 
0.84 and 0.85, respectively), indicating that LRG1 and ITIH3 could serve as 
predictive markers for CRPC. For metabolomic evaluation of exosomes, a series of 
differentially expressed metabolites were identified, and a combined metabolite 
panel showed ROC value of 0.94 for distinguishing PCa from TFC and 0.97 for 
distinguishing CRPC from PCa. Immunohistochemistry of tissue microarray showed 
that LRG1 protein was significantly upregulated in advanced prostate cancer and 
functional assay revealed that ectopic expression of LRG1 can significantly 
enhance the malignant phenotype of prostate cancer cells. More importantly, PCa 
cell derived LRG1-overexpressed exosomes remarkably promoted angiogenesis.
CONCLUSION: Integration of proteomics and metabolomics data generated proteomic 
and metabolic signatures of plasma exosomes that may facilitate discrimination 
of CRPC from PCa and TFC patients, suggesting the potential of exosomal proteins 
and metabolites as CRPC markers. The study also confirmed the important role of 
exosomal protein LRG1 in PCa malignant progression.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic 
inflammatory disease that is related to the aberrant proliferation of 
fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS). Wasp venom (WV, Vespa magnifica, Smith), an 
insect secretion, has been used to treat RA in Chinese Jingpo national 
minority's ancient prescription. However, the potential mechanisms haven't been 
clarified.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The purposes of this paper were two-fold. First, to 
investigate which was the best anti-RA effective part of WV-I (molecular weight 
less than 3 kDa), WV-II (molecular weight 3-10 kDa) and WV-III (molecular weight 
more than 10 kDa) that were separated from WV. Second, to explore the underlying 
molecular mechanism of WV and WV-II that was best effective part in RA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The wasps were electrically stimulated and the secretions 
were collected. WV-I, WV-II and WV-III were acquired by ultracentrifuge method 
according to molecular weight. Next, WV, WV-I, WV-II and WV-III were identified 
by HPLC. Functional annotation and pathway analysis of WV used to bioinformatics 
analysis. RNA-seq analyses were constructed to identify differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs). GO and KEGG pathway analyses were performed by Metascape database. 
STRING was used to analyze the PPI network from DEGs. Next, PPI network was 
visualized using Cytoscape that based on MCODE. The pivotal genes of PPI network 
and MCODE analysis were verified by qRT-PCR. Subsequently, MH7A cells were 
performed MTT assay to evaluate the ability of inhibiting cell proliferation. 
Luciferase activity assay was conducted in HepG2/STAT1 or HepG2/STAT3 cells to 
assess STAT1/3 sensitivity of WV, WV-I, WV-II and WV-III. Additionally, 
interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 expression levels were detected by ELISA kits. 
Intracellular thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) enzyme was evaluated by TrxR activity 
assay kit. ROS levels, lipid ROS levels and Mitochondrial membrane potential 
(MMP) were assessed by fluorescence probe. Cell apoptosis and MMP were measured 
by using flow cytometry. Furthermore, the key proteins of JAK/STAT signaling 
pathway, protein levels of TrxR and glutathione peroxidase 4 axis (GPX4) were 
examined by Western blotting assay.
RESULTS: RNA-sequencing analysis of WV displayed be related to 
oxidation-reduction, inflammation and apoptosis. The data displayed that WV, 
WV-II and WV-III inhibited significantly cells proliferation in human MH7A cell 
line compared to WV-I treatment group, but WV-III had no significant suppressive 
effect on luciferase activity of STAT3 compared with IL-6-induce group. Combined 
with earlier reports that WV-III contained major allergens, we selected WV and 
WV-II further to study the mechanism of anti-RA. In addition, WV and WV-II 
decreased the level of IL-1β and IL-6 in TNF-α-induced MH7A cells via 
inactivating of JAK/STAT signaling pathway. On the other hand, WV and WV-II 
down-regulated the TrxR activity to produce ROS and induce cell apoptosis. 
Furthermore, WV and WV-II could accumulate lipid ROS to induce GPX4-mediated 
ferroptosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the experimental results revealed that WV and WV-II 
were potential therapeutic agents for RA through modulating JAK/STAT signaling 
pathways, redox homeostasis and ferroptosis in MH7A cells. Of note, WV-II was an 
effective part and the predominant active monomer in WV-II will be further 
explored in the future.

L(5).

OBJECTIVES: Fetal death is a complication of pregnancy caused by multiple 
etiologies rather than being the end-result of a single disease process. Many 
soluble analytes in the maternal circulation, such as hormones and cytokines, 
have been implicated in its pathophysiology. However, changes in the protein 
content of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which could provide additional insight 
into the disease pathways of this obstetrical syndrome, have not been examined. 
This study aimed to characterize the proteomic profile of EVs in the plasma of 
pregnant women who experienced fetal death and to evaluate whether such a 
profile reflected the pathophysiological mechanisms of this obstetrical 
complication. Moreover, the proteomic results were compared to and integrated 
with those obtained from the soluble fraction of maternal plasma.
METHODS: This retrospective case-control study included 47 women who experienced 
fetal death and 94 matched, healthy, pregnant controls. Proteomic analysis of 82 
proteins in the EVs and the soluble fractions of maternal plasma samples was 
conducted by using a bead-based, multiplexed immunoassay platform. Quantile 
regression analysis and random forest models were implemented to assess 
differences in the concentration of proteins in the EV and soluble fractions and 
to evaluate their combined discriminatory power between clinical groups. 
Hierarchical cluster analysis was applied to identify subgroups of fetal death 
cases with similar proteomic profiles. A p-value of <.05 was used to infer 
significance, unless multiple testing was involved, with the false discovery 
rate controlled at the 10% level (q < 0.1). All statistical analyses were 
performed by using the R statistical language and environment-and specialized 
packages.
RESULTS: Nineteen proteins (placental growth factor, macrophage migration 
inhibitory factor, endoglin, regulated upon activation normal T cell expressed 
and presumably secreted (RANTES), interleukin (IL)-6, macrophage inflammatory 
protein 1-alpha, urokinase plasminogen activator surface receptor, tissue factor 
pathway inhibitor, IL-8, E-Selectin, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 
2, pentraxin 3, IL-16, galectin-1, monocyte chemotactic protein 1, disintegrin 
and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 12, insulin-like growth 
factor-binding protein 1, matrix metalloproteinase-1(MMP1), and CD163) were 
found to have different plasma concentrations (of an EV or a soluble fraction) 
in women with fetal death compared to controls. There was a similar pattern of 
change for the dysregulated proteins in the EV and soluble fractions and a 
positive correlation between the log2-fold changes of proteins significant in 
either the EV or the soluble fraction (ρ = 0.89, p < .001). The combination of 
EV and soluble fraction proteins resulted in a good discriminatory model (area 
under the ROC curve, 82%; sensitivity, 57.5% at a 10% false-positive rate). 
Unsupervised clustering based on the proteins differentially expressed in either 
the EV or the soluble fraction of patients with fetal death relative to controls 
revealed three major clusters of patients.
CONCLUSION: Pregnant women with fetal death have different concentrations of 19 
proteins in the EV and soluble fractions compared to controls, and the direction 
of changes in concentration was similar between fractions. The combination of EV 
and soluble protein concentrations revealed three different clusters of fetal 
death cases with distinct clinical and placental histopathological 
characteristics.

The anti-caspase 1 inhibitor VX-765 reduces immune activation, CD4(+) T cell 
depletion, viral load, and total HIV-1 DNA in HIV-1 infected humanized mice.

M(2), Seguin-Devaux C(1).

HIV-1 infection results in the activation of inflammasome that may facilitate 
viral spread and establishment of viral reservoirs. We evaluated the effects of 
the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 on HIV-1 infection in humanized NSG mice 
engrafted with human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells. Expression of caspase-1, 
NLRP3, and IL-1β was increased in lymph nodes and bone marrow between day 1 and 
3 after HIV-1 infection (mean fold change (FC) of 2.08, 3.23, and 6.05, p<0.001, 
respectively). IFI16 and AIM2 expression peaked at day 24 and coincides with 
increased IL-18 levels (6.89 vs 83.19 pg/ml, p=0.004), increased viral load and 
CD4+ T cells loss in blood (p<0.005 and p<0.0001, for the spleen respectively). 
Treatment with VX-765 significantly reduced TNF-α at day 11 (0.47 vs 2.2 pg/ml, 
p=0.045), IL-18 at day 22 (7.8 vs 23.2 pg/ml, p=0.04), CD4+ T cells (44.3% vs 
36,7%, p=0.01), viral load (4.26 vs 4.89 log 10 copies/ml, p=0.027), and total 
HIV-1 DNA in the spleen (1 054 vs 2 889 copies /106 cells, p=0.029). We 
demonstrated that targeting inflammasome activation early after infection may 
represent a therapeutic strategy towards HIV cure to prevent CD4+ T cell 
depletion and reduce immune activation, viral load, and the HIV-1 reservoir 
formation.

Plain Language Summary: The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) affects millions 
of people across the world, and has caused over forty million deaths. HIV 
attacks the immune system, eventually leading to lower levels of immune cells, 
which prevent the body from fighting infections. One of the early effects of HIV 
infection is inflammation, an immune process that helps the body remove foreign 
invaders like viruses. Unfortunately, long term inflammation can lead to serious 
conditions like cardiovascular disease and cancer. Doctors manage HIV using a 
class of drugs known as antiretrovirals. These drugs reduce the amount of virus 
in the body, but they cannot eliminate it entirely. This is because, in the 
early days of infection, copies of the virus build up in certain organs and 
tissues, like the gut, forming viral reservoirs. Antiretroviral drugs cannot 
reach these reservoirs to eliminate them, making a cure for HIV out of reach. 
One way to address this problem is to develop a new class of drugs that can stop 
the virus from forming these reservoirs in the first place. Amand et al. wanted 
to see whether they could reduce the amount of viral reservoirs that form in HIV 
patients by interrupting a process called inflammasome activation, which occurs 
early after HIV infection. Inflammasomes are viral detectors that play a role in 
both inflammation and the formation of viral reservoirs. They activate an enzyme 
called caspase-1, which in turn activates proteins called cytokines. These 
cytokines go on to stimulate further inflammation. Amand et al. wanted to see 
whether a drug called VX-765, which blocks the activity of the caspase-1 enzyme, 
could reduce inflammation and stop the formation of viral reservoirs. To do 
this, Amand et al. first ‘humanized’ mice, by populating them with human immune 
cells, so they could become infected with HIV. They then infected these mice 
with HIV, and proceeded to treat them with VX-765 two days after infection. The 
results showed that these mice had fewer viral reservoirs, lower levels of 
cytokines and higher numbers of immune cells than untreated mice. The findings 
of Amand et al. show that targeting inflammasome activation early after 
infection could be a promising strategy for treating HIV. Indeed, if similar 
results were obtained in humans, then this technique may be the road towards a 
cure for this virus. In any case, it is likely that combining drugs like VX765 
with antiretrovirals will improve long term outcomes for people with HIV.

INTRODUCTION: Tubulointerstitial damage in diabetes and chronic kidney disease 
(CKD) is poorly captured by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and 
albuminuria. Urine biomarkers of kidney health may better elucidate disease 
progression in persons with diabetes and CKD.
METHODS: Per case-cohort design, we randomly selected a subcohort of 560 study 
participants of the REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke 
(REGARDS) study from 1092 adults with diabetes and baseline eGFR <60 ml/min per 
1.73 m2 and registered a total of 161 end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) cases (n = 
93 from the subcohort; n = 68 from outside the subcohort) during 4.3 ± 2.7 years 
mean follow-up. We measured urine biomarkers of kidney tubule injury (kidney 
injury molecule-1 [KIM-1]), inflammation and fibrosis (monocyte chemoattractant 
protein-1 [MCP-1]), repair (chitinase-3-like protein 1 [YKL-40]), and tubule 
function, including reabsorption (alpha-1-microglobulin [α1m]) and synthetic 
capacity (epidermal growth factor [EGF] and uromodulin [UMOD]). Weighted Cox 
regression models estimated ESKD risk adjusting for demographics, ESKD risk 
factors, and baseline eGFR and urine albumin. Least absolute shrinkage and 
selection operator (LASSO) regression identified a subset of biomarkers most 
strongly associated with ESKD.
RESULTS: At baseline, subcohort participants had mean age of 70 ± 9 years, mean 
eGFR of 40 ±13 ml/min per 1.73 m2, and median urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio 
of 33 (interquartile range 10-213) mg/g. Adjusting for baseline eGFR and 
albuminuria, each 2-fold higher urine KIM-1 (hazard ratio = 1.43 [95% CI: 
1.17-1.75]), α1m (hazard ratio = 1.47 [1.19-1.82]), and MCP-1 (hazard ratio = 
1.27 [1.06-1.53]) were independently associated with ESKD. LASSO retained KIM-1 
and α1m for associations with ESKD.
CONCLUSION: Among adults with diabetes and eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, higher 
urine KIM-1, α1m, and MCP-1 are independently associated with incident ESKD, 
providing insight into kidney disease progression in persons with diabetes and 
CKD.

OBJECTIVES: To find causal genes for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and its 
seropositive (RF and/or ACPA positive) and seronegative subsets.
METHODS: We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 31 313 RA cases 
(68% seropositive) and ~1 million controls from Northwestern Europe. We searched 
for causal genes outside the HLA-locus through effect on coding, mRNA expression 
in several tissues and/or levels of plasma proteins (SomaScan) and did network 
analysis (Qiagen).
RESULTS: We found 25 sequence variants for RA overall, 33 for seropositive and 2 
for seronegative RA, altogether 37 sequence variants at 34 non-HLA loci, of 
which 15 are novel. Genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of these 
yielded 25 causal genes in seropositive RA and additional two overall. Most 
encode proteins in the network of interferon-alpha/beta and IL-12/23 that signal 
through the JAK/STAT-pathway. Highlighting those with largest effect on 
seropositive RA, a rare missense variant in STAT4 (rs140675301-A) that is 
independent of reported non-coding STAT4-variants, increases the risk of 
seropositive RA 2.27-fold (p=2.1×10-9), more than the rs2476601-A missense 
variant in PTPN22 (OR=1.59, p=1.3×10-160). STAT4 rs140675301-A replaces 
hydrophilic glutamic acid with hydrophobic valine (Glu128Val) in a conserved, 
surface-exposed loop. A stop-mutation (rs76428106-C) in FLT3 increases 
seropositive RA risk (OR=1.35, p=6.6×10-11). Independent missense variants in 
TYK2 (rs34536443-C, rs12720356-C, rs35018800-A, latter two novel) associate with 
decreased risk of seropositive RA (ORs=0.63-0.87, p=10-9-10-27) and decreased 
plasma levels of interferon-alpha/beta receptor 1 that signals through 
TYK2/JAK1/STAT4.
CONCLUSION: Sequence variants pointing to causal genes in the JAK/STAT pathway 
have largest effect on seropositive RA, while associations with seronegative RA 
remain scarce.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 surveillance efforts integrated genome 
sequencing of clinical samples to identify emergent viral variants and to 
support rapid experimental examination of genome-informed vaccine and 
therapeutic designs. Given the broad range of methods applied to generate new 
viral genomes, it is critical that consensus and variant calling tools yield 
consistent results across disparate pipelines. Here we examine the impact of 
sequencing technologies (Illumina and Oxford Nanopore) and 7 different 
downstream bioinformatic protocols on SARS-CoV-2 variant calling as part of the 
NIH Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) 
Tracking Resistance and Coronavirus Evolution (TRACE) initiative, a 
public-private partnership established to address the COVID-19 outbreak. Our 
results indicate that bioinformatic workflows can yield consensus genomes with 
different single nucleotide polymorphisms, insertions, and/or deletions even 
when using the same raw sequence input datasets. We introduce the use of a 
specific suite of parameters and protocols that greatly improves the agreement 
among pipelines developed by diverse organizations. Such consistency among 
bioinformatic pipelines is fundamental to SARS-CoV-2 and future pathogen 
surveillance efforts. The application of analysis standards is necessary to more

AIM: To evaluate the real-world effectiveness and safety of insulin glargine 
300 U/ml (Gla-300) in achieving glycaemic goals in insulin-naïve people with 
type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Mexico, Colombia and Peru (Latin America region) in the 
A Toujeo Observational Study (ATOS).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: ATOS was a multicentre, prospective, 12-month 
observational study, which included 4422 insulin-naïve adults (age ≥ 18 years) 
with T2D uncontrolled (HbA1c > 7% and ≤11%) on at least one oral antidiabetic 
drug (OAD) who initiated Gla-300 treatment as per routine practice. The primary 
endpoint was the percentage of participants achieving their predefined 
individualized HbA1c goal at month 6. Key secondary endpoints included change 
from baseline in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting self-monitored 
blood glucose (SMBG), body weight and incidence of hypoglycaemia.
RESULTS: In this subgroup analysis, a total of 314 participants with T2D 
received Gla-300. At baseline, mean ± SD age was 56.0 ± 11.6 years, duration of 
diabetes was 9.7 ± 6.6 years and 65.9% of participants were on at least two 
OADs. The individualized HbA1c target was achieved by 25.8% of participants (95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 20.3-31.9) at month 6 and by 35.3% (95% CI: 28.5-42.5) 
at month 12. Gla-300 treatment improved glycaemic control with meaningful 
reductions in mean HbA1c, FPG and fasting SMBG. The incidence of hypoglycaemia 
reported was low and body weight remained stable.
CONCLUSIONS: In a real-world setting in the Latin America region, the initiation 
of Gla-300 in people with T2D uncontrolled on OADs resulted in improved 
glycaemic control with a low incidence of hypoglycaemia and no change in body 
weight.

simulations approach.

Computationally simulated micelle models provide useful structural information 
on the molecular and biological sciences. One strategy to study the 
self-aggregation process of surfactant molecules that make up a micelle is 
through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In this study, a theoretical 
approach with a coarse-grained MD simulation (CG-MD) was employed to evaluate 
the critical micellar concentration (CMC), the micellization process, building a 
tridimensional (3D) model system of a micelle using data from the experimentally 
enzymatically modified phospholipids (PL) by phospholipase A1 (PA1). This 
required enzymatic interesterification of soybean phosphatidylcholine (PC) with 
caprylic acid, along with purification and characterization by chromatographic 
techniques to measure the esterified fatty acids and the corresponding PL 
composition. The number of molecules used in the CG-MD simulation system was 
determined from the experimental CMC data which was 0.025%. The molecular 
composition of the system is: 1 C 18:2, 2 C 8:0/8:0, 3 C 8:0/18:3n-9, 4 C 
8:0/18:0, 5 C8:0/18:2n-6, 6 C8:0/18:1n-9, and 7 C 8:0/16:0. According to our 
theoretical results, the micelle model is structurally stable with an average Rg 
of 3.64 ± 0.10 Å, and might have an elliptical form with a radius of 24.6 Å. 
Regarding CMC value there was a relationship between the experimental data of 
the modified PLs and the theoretical analysis by GC-MD, which suggest that the 
enzymatic modification of PLs does not affect their self-aggregation properties. 
Finally, the micellar system obtained in the current research can be used as a 
simple and useful model to design optimal biocompatible nanoemulsions as 
possible vehicles for bioactive small molecules.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Tumor Growth Rate Informs Treatment Efficacy in Metastatic Pancreatic 
Adenocarcinoma: Application of a Growth and Regression Model to Pivotal Trial 
and Real-World Data.

T(8), Fojo T(2)(9), Manji GA(2), Von Hoff D(10)(11), Bates SE(2)(9).

BACKGROUND: Methods for screening agents earlier in development and strategies 
for conducting smaller randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed.
METHODS: We retrospectively applied a tumor growth model to estimate the rates 
of growth of pancreatic cancer using radiographic tumor measurements or serum CA 
19-9 values from 3033 patients with stages III-IV PDAC who were enrolled in 8 
clinical trials or were included in 2 large real-world data sets.
RESULTS: g correlated inversely with OS and was consistently lower in the 
experimental arms than in the control arms of RCTs. At the individual patient 
level, g was significantly faster for lesions metastatic to the liver relative 
to those localized to the pancreas. Regardless of regimen, g increased toward 
the end of therapy, often by over 3-fold.
CONCLUSIONS: Growth rates of PDAC can be determined using radiographic tumor 
measurement and CA 19-9 values. g is inversely associated with OS and can 
differentiate therapies within the same trial and across trials. g can also be 
used to characterize changes in the behavior of an individual's PDAC, such as 
differences in the growth rate of lesions based on metastatic site, and the 
emergence of chemoresistance. We provide examples of how g can be used to 
benchmark phase II and III clinical data to a virtual reference arm to inform 
go/no go decisions and consider novel trial designs to optimize and accelerate 
drug development.

[Pseudotargeted metabolomics analysis of pine pollen intervention in the liver 
of premature ovarian failure rats].

[Article in Chinese]

J(2), Zeng M(2).

Premature ovarian failure (POF) is a prevalent gynecological disease. In 
traditional Chinese medicine, it is believed that POF is directly related to 
abnormal function of the liver and kidneys. As such, regulation of the liver 
metabolism through the use of medicinal and edible substances is important for 
the treatment of POF. Pine pollen, a traditional Chinese medicinal and edible 
pollen variety, contains various active substances, such as sex hormones and 
phytohormones, which have been used to inhibit inflammation, regulate the immune 
system, and protect reproductive tissues. Using ultra-high performance liquid 
chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS), this study 
examined the influence of pine pollen on the liver metabolome of 
cyclophosphamide-induced POF model Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. The variations in 
the metabolites present in the liver tissue of control SD rats, model SD rats, 
and SD rats treated with various doses of pine pollen or estrogen were analyzed 
using principal component analysis (PCA) in combination with orthogonal partial 
least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) and other multivariate statistical 
methods to reveal the mechanism of pine pollen intervention in the livers of POF 
SD rats. An animal model experiment was conducted using six groups of 
ten-week-old rats. Cyclophosphamide was administered intraperitoneally to the 
model group and four intervention groups at a dosage of 60 mg/kg for 1 d 
followed by a dosage of 10 mg/kg for 14 d. Within the following four weeks, each 
of the four intervention groups received the intragastric administration of 0.1, 
0.5, or 1.5 g/kg bodyweight (BW) of pine pollen, or 0.075 g/kg BW of conjugated 
estrogens (positive control). Equal quantities of normal saline were 
administered to the control and cyclophosphamide-treated model groups. 
Subsequently, the rat livers were subject to pseudotargeted metabolomics, and a 
total of 687 liver metabolites were discovered using both positive and negative 
ions. The metabolites differing in content were screened using the t-test 
(p<0.05) and the fold change (FC>2 or <0.5) in univariate analysis, and the 
variable importance in projection (VIP>1) in multivariate analysis. It was found 
that in comparison with the control group, the contents of 32 metabolites 
significantly increased, while those of 28 metabolites significantly decreased 
in the model group. The majority of these metabolites were involved α-linolenic 
acid metabolism, vitamin B6 metabolism, and purine metabolism, along with the 
lysine degradation and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis metabolic pathways. Compared 
with the cyclophosphamide-induced model group, the estrogen group exhibited 
increased levels of 47 metabolites and decreased levels of 29 metabolites, 
wherein 34 metabolites were restored to the levels found in the control group. 
These metabolites mainly involved the vitamin B6, lysine, 
glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, arginine and proline, and cysteine and methionine 
metabolic pathways. In the low/medium/high-dose pine pollen groups, the contents 
of 34/32/34 metabolites increased, the contents of 30/37/24 metabolites 
decreased, and the contents of 47/38/34 metabolites were restored to the levels 
found in the control group, respectively. These metabolites were mainly involved 
in vitamin B6 metabolism, purine metabolism, and the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis 
metabolic pathway. These results therefore indicate that the restoring effect of 
pine pollen is equivalent or superior to that of conjugated estrogen. 
Additionally, based on the known metabolic pathways, it appears that when 
estrogen interferes with the liver metabolism, the key metabolic pathways that 
become affected are the arginine and proline metabolism and cysteine and 
methionine metabolism pathways. In contrast, pine pollen intervention affected 
existing metabolic pathways that were known to be disordered by 
cyclophosphamide. The use of pine pollen may therefore restore the levels of 
many metabolites. It should be noted that 23 overlaps exist between the 
estrogen-restored metabolites and the pine pollen-restored metabolites, 
including a variety of acylcarnitines, such as ACar 10∶0. As a result, pine 
pollen extract may be able to normalize the liver metabolic abnormalities 
induced by POF. This study therefore establishes a theoretical reference for the 
development of functional applications for pine pollen and for the treatment of 
POF.

卵巢早衰是妇科领域的常见病,中医认为卵巢早衰与肝肾的正常与否息息相关,通过药食两用物质对肝脏代谢的调理是治疗卵巢早衰的一种重要手段。该研究基于超高效液相色谱-三重四极杆质谱(UHPLC-MS/MS)建立的广泛靶向代谢组学技术,探讨破壁松花粉对环磷酰胺诱导的卵巢早衰模型大鼠肝脏代谢的影响,旨在通过测定对照组、模型组、雌激素阳性对照组及施以不同剂量的松花粉干预组的SD大鼠肝脏组织中代谢物的含量变化,结合主成分分析(PCA)、正交偏最小二乘判别分析(OPLS-DA)等多元统计方法揭示松花粉干预卵巢早衰大鼠肝脏代谢的作用机制。通过正、负离子模式共检测出687种肝脏代谢物,PCA与OPLS-DA显示环磷酰胺诱导的模型组能够与对照组、阳性对照组、松花粉干预组等组别之间的代谢物较好的分离。通过单变量分析中的t检验(p<0.05)、变异倍数(FC>2或<0.5)与多变量分析中变量投影重要性(VIP值)>1相结合对差异代谢物进行筛选。与对照组相比,模型组SD大鼠肝脏中的32个生物标志物含量显著升高,28个生物标志物含量显著降低,主要涉及α-亚麻酸代谢、维生素B6代谢、嘌呤代谢、赖氨酸降解和糖酵解/糖异生途径;松花粉的干预可以使代谢物回调,以雌激素组为参考,松花粉的有效干预主要涉及维生素B6的代谢途径。研究表明,花粉提取物可以调节伴随卵巢早衰的肝脏代谢紊乱,促进代谢向正常水平回归。

MJ(7), Chen YJ(8), Li GC(9), Ho SY(10), Chen HH(11), Huang YS(12), Hung CC(13), 
Chen YC(14), Chang SY(15), Chang SC(16).

BACKGROUND: Patients recovering from COVID-19 may need vaccination against 
SARS-CoV-2 because acquired immunity from primary infection may wane, given the 
emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants. Understanding the trends of anti-spike IgG 
and neutralizing antibody titers in patients recovering from COVID-19 may inform 
the decision made on the appropriate interval between recovery and vaccination.
METHODS: Participants aged 20 years or older and diagnosed with COVID-19 between 
January and December, 2020 were enrolled. Serum specimens were collected every 
three months from 10 days to 12 months after the onset of symptom for 
determinations of anti-spike IgG and neutralizing antibody titers against 
SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain with D614G mutation, alpha, gamma and delta variants.
RESULTS: Of 19 participants, we found a decreasing trend of geometric mean 
titers of anti-spike IgG from 560.9 to 217 and 92 BAU/mL after a 4-month and a 
7-month follow-up, respectively. The anti-spike IgG titers declined more quickly 
in the ten participants with severe or critical disease than the nine 
participants with only mild to moderate disease between one month and seven 
months after SARS-CoV-2 infection (-8.49 vs - 2.34-fold, p < 0.001). The 
neutralizing activity of the convalescent serum specimens collected from 
participants recovering from wild-type SARS-CoV-2 infection against different 
variants was lower, especially against the delta variants (p < 0.01 for each 
variant with Wuhan strain as reference).
CONCLUSION: Acquired immunity from primary infection with SARS-CoV-2 waned 
within 4-7 months in COVID-19 patients, and neutralizing cross-activities 
against different SARS-CoV-2 variants were lower compared with those against 
wild-type strain.

Effective mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are available but need to be stored in 
freezers, limiting their use to countries that have appropriate storage 
capacity. ChulaCov19 is a prefusion non-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 
spike-protein-encoding, nucleoside-modified mRNA, lipid nanoparticle 
encapsulated vaccine that we report to be stable when stored at 2-8 °C for up to 
3 months. Here we report safety and immunogenicity data from a phase I 
open-label, dose escalation, first-in-human trial of the ChulaCov19 vaccine 
(NCT04566276). Seventy-two eligible volunteers, 36 of whom were aged 18-55 
(adults) and 36 aged 56-75 (elderly), were enroled. Two doses of vaccine were 
administered 21 d apart at 10, 25 or 50 μg per dose (12 per group). The primary 
outcome was safety and the secondary outcome was immunogenicity. All three 
dosages of ChulaCov19 were well tolerated and elicited robust dose-dependent and 
age-dependent B- and T-cell responses. Transient mild/moderate injection site 
pain, fever, chills, fatigue and headache were more common after the second 
dose. Four weeks after the second dose, in the adult cohort, MicroVNT-50 
geometric mean titre against wild-type SARS-CoV-2 was 848 (95% CI, 483-1,489), 
736 (459-1,183) and 1,140 (854-1,522) IU ml-1 at 10, 25 and 50 μg doses, 
respectively, versus 285 (196-413) IU ml-1 for human convalescent sera. All dose 
levels elicited 100% seroconversion, with geometric mean titre ratios 4-8-fold 
higher than for human convalescent sera (P < 0.01), and high IFNγ spot-forming 
cells per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The 50 μg dose induced 
better cross-neutralization against Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants than 
lower doses. ChulaCov19 at 50 μg is well tolerated and elicited higher 
neutralizing antibodies than human convalescent sera, with strong T-cell 
responses. These antibodies cross-neutralized four variants of concern. 
ChulaCov19 has proceeded to phase 2 clinical trials. We conclude that the mRNA 
vaccine expressing a prefusion non-stabilized spike protein is safe and highly 
immunogenic.

Multi-proteomic Analysis Revealed Distinct Protein Profiles in Cerebrospinal 
Fluid of Patients Between Anti-NMDAR Encephalitis NORSE and Cryptogenic NORSE.

Y(2)(3)(4)(5), Xu K(6).

New-onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE) is rare but intractable. 
Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis and cryptogenic 
etiologies are the two major causes of NORSE with distinct clinical features. To 
elucidate the underlying mechanisms, 6 patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis 
NORSE and 5 with cryptogenic NORSE (C-NORSE) were enrolled. Five patients of 
cerebrovascular disorders were used as controls. Quantitative proteomic analysis 
of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of the patients revealed 101 and 56 
proteins were changed, respectively. The average fold-change of the upregulated 
proteins, namely up-proteomic score in this study, was positively correlated 
with the severity and prognosis of the diseases, including ICU stay (r = 0.9308, 
P = 0.0035 in NMDAR group; r = 0.8977, P = 0.0193 in C-NORSE group), mRS score 
at discharge (r = 0.9710, P = 0.0111 in NMDAR group; r = 0.7071, P = 0.2000 in 
C-NORSE group), and time taken for patients awaking from a coma (r = 0.8823, 
P = 0.0100 in NMDAR group; r = 0.7906, P = 0.2000 in C-NORSE group). Pathways 
involved in humoral immune response, wound healing, and epigenetic regulation of 
transcription were upregulated in anti-NMDAR encephalitis NORSE. Pathways of 
innate and lymphocyte mediated immune response, synaptic functions, 
ubiquitination, and cell apoptosis were up-regulated in C-NORSE, which was 
consistent with a mouse model of status epilepticus. Fc receptor and B cell 
mediated immunity signaling pathways were downregulated in C-NORSE. Immunome 
microarray analysis demonstrated high autoantibody targeting 48 proteins in CSF 
samples of anti-NMDAR encephalitis NORSE. While the reaction was kept at a very 
low level in C-NORSE. There is no significant difference in inflammatory 
cytokine level between each group. The level of IL-4 (r = 0.7435, P = 0.0451), 
IL-13 (r = 0.7643, P = 0.0384), IFN-γ (r = 0.7973, P = 0.0287) and TNF-α 
(r = 0.8598, P = 0.0141) in NMDAR group, and IL-6 (r = 0.8479, P = 0.0348), IL-8 
(r = 0.9076, P = 0.0166) in C-NORSE group were positively correlated with the 
up-proteomic score. The present study suggests that the up-proteomic score of 
CSF could be a promising indicator for assessment of the severity of anti-NMDAR 
encephalitis NORSE and C-NORSE. The distinct CSF proteomes imply different 
pathogenic mechanisms of the two diseases, and immunotherapy strategies as well.

BACKGROUND: Ischemia-reperfusion (IR) of a kidney transplant (KTx) upregulates 
TNF α production that amplifies allograft inflammation and may negatively affect 
transplant outcomes.
METHODS: We tested the effects of blocking TNF peri-KTx via a randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, 15-center, phase 2 clinical trial. A total of 
225 primary transplant recipients of deceased-donor kidneys (KTx; 38.2% 
Black/African American, 44% White) were randomized to receive intravenous 
infliximab (IFX) 3 mg/kg or saline placebo (PLBO) initiated before kidney 
reperfusion. All patients received rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin induction and 
maintenance immunosuppression (IS) with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and 
prednisone. The primary end point was the difference between groups in mean 
24-month eGFR.
RESULTS: There was no difference in the primary end point of 24-month eGFR 
between IFX (52.45 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 ; 95% CI, 48.38 to 56.52) versus PLBO 
(57.35 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 ; 95% CI, 53.18 to 61.52; P =0.1). There were no 
significant differences between groups in rates of delayed graft function, 
biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR), development of de novo donor-specific 
antibodies, or graft loss/death. Immunosuppression did not differ, and day 7 
post-KTx plasma analyses showed approximately ten-fold lower TNF ( P <0.001) in 
IFX versus PLBO. BK viremia requiring IS change occurred more frequently in IFX 
(28.9%) versus PLBO (13.4%; P =0.004), with a strong trend toward higher rates 
of BKV nephropathy in IFX (13.3%) versus PLBO (4.9%; P =0.06).
CONCLUSIONS: IFX induction therapy does not benefit recipients of kidney 
transplants from deceased donors on this IS regimen. Because the intervention 
unexpectedly increased rates of BK virus infections, our findings underscore the 
complexities of targeting peritransplant inflammation as a strategy to improve 
KTx outcomes.Clinical Trial registry name and registration

A 2.5-Year Weight Management Program Using Noom Health: Protocol for a 
Randomized Controlled Trial.

Sysko R(1), Bibeau J(1), Boyar A(1), Costello K(1), Michaelides A(2), Mitchell 
ES(2), Susanin A(1), Hildebrandt T(1).

BACKGROUND: Overweight and obesity are serious public health concerns. As the 
prevalence of excess weight among individuals continues to increase, there is a 
parallel need for inexpensive, highly accessible, and evidence-based weight loss 
programs.
OBJECTIVE: This weight loss trial will aim to examine the efficacy of the Noom 
weight loss program in comparison to a digital control after a 6-month 
intervention phase and a 24-month maintenance phase, with assessments continuing 
for 2 years beyond the intervention (to 30 months-after the baseline). The 
secondary outcomes include quality of life, psychosocial functioning, sleep 
quality, physical activity, diet, and health status. This trial will also 
examine the severity of obesity-related functional impairment, weight loss 
history, and demographic moderators, along with adherence and self-efficacy as 
mediators of the outcome.
METHODS: A total of 600 participants were randomized in a parallel-group, 
controlled trial to either Noom Healthy Weight Program (intervention) or Noom 
Healthy Weight Control (control) for a 6-month intervention. Both intervention 
and control groups include diet and exercise recommendations, educational 
content, daily logging capabilities, and daily weigh-in entries. The Noom 
Healthy Weight Program also includes a coach support for weight loss. Remote 
follow-up assessments of eating, physical activity, psychosocial factors, app 
use data, and weight will be conducted at 1, 4, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 months 
after baseline. Weight is measured at each follow-up point during a Zoom call 
using the participants' scales.
RESULTS: Enrollment began in March 2021 and the 6-month intervention phase ended 
in March 2022. Data collection for the final assessment will be completed in 
March 2024.
CONCLUSIONS: This study tests commercially available digital lifestyle 
interventions for individuals with overweight and obesity seeking weight loss 
support. Data obtained from the study will evaluate whether the Noom Healthy 
Weight Control Program can help individuals overcome weight loss, achieve 
long-term maintenance, adhere to lifestyle changes, and feature use barriers 
that are present in other traditional weight loss treatments.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to persist due to mutations 
resulting in newer, more infectious variants of concern. We aimed to leverage an 
ongoing private SARS-CoV-2 testing laboratory's infrastructure to monitor 
SARS-CoV-2 variants in two large California counties. Study enrollment was 
offered to adults aged 18 years or older in Los Angeles County and Riverside 
County who recently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) assay. A cycle threshold value less than or equal to 30 cycles 
was considered a positive test for sequencing purposes. Within 5 days of study 
enrollment, clinician-monitored, self-collected oral fluid and anterior nares 
swab specimens were obtained from participants. Specimens were transported and 
stored at 8 °C or cooler. Samples underwent ribonucleic acid extraction, library 
preparation, and sequencing. SARS-CoV-2 lineages were identified using 
sequencing data. Participant and genomic data were analyzed using statistical 
tools and visualized with toolkits. The study was approved by Advarra 
Institutional Review Board (Pro00053729). From May 27, 2021 to September 9, 
2021, 503 individuals were enrolled and underwent specimen collection. Of the 
503 participants, 238 (47.3%) participants were women, 329 (63.6%) participants 
were vaccinated, and 221 (43.9%) participants were of Hispanic or Spanish 
origin. Of the cohort, 496 (98.6%) participants had symptoms at the time of 
collection. Among the 503 samples, 443 (88.1%) nasal specimens and 353 (70.2%) 
oral specimens yielded positive sequencing results. Over our study period, the 
prevalence of the Alpha variant of SARS-CoV-2 decreased (initially 23.1% [95% 
confidence interval (95% CI): 0-0.49%] to 0% [95% CI 0.0-0.0%]) as the 
prevalence of the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 increased (initially 33.3% [95% CI 
0.0-100.0%] to 100.0% [95% CI 100.0-100.0%]). A strain that carried mutations of 
both Delta and Mu was identified. We found that outpatient SARS-CoV-2 variant 
surveillance could be conducted in a timely and accurate manner. The prevalence 
of different variants changed over time. A higher proportion of nasal specimens 
yielded results versus oral specimens. Timely and regional outpatient SARS-CoV-2 
variant surveillance could be used for public health efforts to identify changes 
in SARS-CoV-2 strain epidemiology.

APOE*4Pittsburgh) in late-onset Alzheimer disease.

A rare missense APOE variant (L28P; APOE*4Pittsburgh), which is present only in 
populations with European ancestry, has been reported to be a risk factor for 
late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). However, due to the complete linkage 
disequilibrium of L28P with APOE*4 (C112R), its independent genetic association 
is uncertain. The original association study implicating L28P with LOAD risk was 
carried out in a relatively small sample size. In the current study, we have 
re-evaluated this association in a large case-control sample of 15,762 White 
U.S. subjects and investigated its independent effect in APOE 3/4 subjects, as 
L28P has been observed only in the heterozygous state of APOE*4 carriers and 3/4 
is the most common genotype containing the APOE*4 allele. The heterozygous 
carrier frequency of L28P, all with APOE*4, was about 3-fold higher in AD cases 
than in cognitively intact controls (0.845% vs. 0.277%). The age- and 
sex-adjusted meta-analysis odds ratio (OR) was 2.87 (95% CI: 1.34 - 
6.13; = 0.0066). Among APOE 3/4 subjects, age- and sex-adjusted meta-analysis OR 
was 1.53 (95% CI: 0.70 - 3.36; p = 0.28), indicating its effect was independent 
of APOE*4. The lack of statistical significance appears mainly due to the low 
power of 4138 subjects with the 3/4 genotype (12% power at α= 0.05) compared to 
the required sample of 139,088 subjects with the 3/4 genotype to detect an OR of 
1.5 at α= 0.05 and 80% power. Our data suggesting that L28P has an independent 
genetic effect on AD risk is reinforced by earlier experimental findings showing 
that this mutation leads to significant structural and conformational changes in 
the ApoE4 molecule and can induce functional defects associated with neuronal 
Aβ42 accumulation and oxidative stress. Additional functional studies in 
cell-based systems and animal models will help to delineate its functional 
significance in the etiology of AD.

Embryologist agreement when assessing blastocyst implantation probability: is 
data-driven prediction the solution to embryo assessment subjectivity?

STUDY QUESTION: What is the accuracy and agreement of embryologists when 
assessing the implantation probability of blastocysts using time-lapse imaging 
(TLI), and can it be improved with a data-driven algorithm?
SUMMARY ANSWER: The overall interobserver agreement of a large panel of 
embryologists was moderate and prediction accuracy was modest, while the 
purpose-built artificial intelligence model generally resulted in higher 
performance metrics.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Previous studies have demonstrated significant 
interobserver variability amongst embryologists when assessing embryo quality. 
However, data concerning embryologists' ability to predict implantation 
probability using TLI is still lacking. Emerging technologies based on 
data-driven tools have shown great promise for improving embryo selection and 
predicting clinical outcomes.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: TLI video files of 136 embryos with known 
implantation data were retrospectively collected from two clinical sites between 
2018 and 2019 for the performance assessment of 36 embryologists and comparison 
with a deep neural network (DNN).
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: We recruited 39 embryologists from 13 
different countries. All participants were blinded to clinical outcomes. A total 
of 136 TLI videos of embryos that reached the blastocyst stage were used for 
this experiment. Each embryo's likelihood of successfully implanting was 
assessed by 36 embryologists, providing implantation probability grades (IPGs) 
from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates a very low likelihood of implantation and 5 
indicates a very high likelihood. Subsequently, three embryologists with over 5 
years of experience provided Gardner scores. All 136 blastocysts were 
categorized into three quality groups based on their Gardner scores. 
Embryologist predictions were then converted into predictions of implantation 
(IPG ≥ 3) and no implantation (IPG ≤ 2). Embryologists' performance and 
agreement were assessed using Fleiss kappa coefficient. A 10-fold 
cross-validation DNN was developed to provide IPGs for TLI video files. The 
model's performance was compared to that of the embryologists.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Logistic regression was employed for the 
following confounding variables: country of residence, academic level, embryo 
scoring system, log years of experience and experience using TLI. None were 
found to have a statistically significant impact on embryologist performance at 
α = 0.05. The average implantation prediction accuracy for the embryologists was 
51.9% for all embryos (N = 136). The average accuracy of the embryologists when 
assessing top quality and poor quality embryos (according to the Gardner score 
categorizations) was 57.5% and 57.4%, respectively, and 44.6% for fair quality 
embryos. Overall interobserver agreement was moderate (κ = 0.56, N = 136). The 
best agreement was achieved in the poor + top quality group (κ = 0.65, N = 77), 
while the agreement in the fair quality group was lower (κ = 0.25, N = 59). The 
DNN showed an overall accuracy rate of 62.5%, with accuracies of 62.2%, 61% and 
65.6% for the poor, fair and top quality groups, respectively. The AUC for the 
DNN was higher than that of the embryologists overall (0.70 DNN vs 0.61 
embryologists) as well as in all of the Gardner groups (DNN vs 
embryologists-Poor: 0.69 vs 0.62; Fair: 0.67 vs 0.53; Top: 0.77 vs 0.54).
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Blastocyst assessment was performed using 
video files acquired from time-lapse incubators, where each video contained data 
from a single focal plane. Clinical data regarding the underlying cause of 
infertility and endometrial thickness before the transfer was not available, yet 
may explain implantation failure and lower accuracy of IPGs. Implantation was 
defined as the presence of a gestational sac, whereas the detection of fetal 
heartbeat is a more robust marker of embryo viability. The raw data were 
anonymized to the extent that it was not possible to quantify the number of 
unique patients and cycles included in the study, potentially masking the effect 
of bias from a limited patient pool. Furthermore, the lack of demographic data 
makes it difficult to draw conclusions on how representative the dataset was of 
the wider population. Finally, embryologists were required to assess the 
implantation potential, not embryo quality. Although this is not the traditional 
approach to embryo evaluation, morphology/morphokinetics as a means of assessing 
embryo quality is believed to be strongly correlated with viability and, for 
some methods, implantation potential.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Embryo selection is a key element in IVF 
success and continues to be a challenge. Improving the predictive ability could 
assist in optimizing implantation success rates and other clinical outcomes and 
could minimize the financial and emotional burden on the patient. This study 
demonstrates moderate agreement rates between embryologists, likely due to the 
subjective nature of embryo assessment. In particular, we found that average 
embryologist accuracy and agreement were significantly lower for fair quality 
embryos when compared with that for top and poor quality embryos. Using 
data-driven algorithms as an assistive tool may help IVF professionals increase 
success rates and promote much needed standardization in the IVF clinic. Our 
results indicate a need for further research regarding technological advancement 
in this field.

Placental protein levels in maternal serum are associated with adverse pregnancy 
outcomes in nulliparous patients.

CB(2); Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-Be Group.

BACKGROUND: The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and 
Human Development Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-Be 
was established to investigate the underlying causes and pathophysiological 
pathways associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes in nulliparous gravidas.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to study placental physiology and identify novel 
biomarkers concerning adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preterm birth 
(medically indicated and spontaneous), preeclampsia, small-for-gestational-age 
neonates, and stillbirth. We measured levels of placental proteins in the 
maternal circulation in the first 2 trimesters of pregnancy.
STUDY DESIGN: Maternal serum samples were collected at 2 study visits (6-13 
weeks and 16-21 weeks), and levels of 9 analytes were measured. The analytes we 
measured were vascular endothelial growth factor, placental growth factor, 
endoglin, soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1, A disintegrin and 
metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 12, pregnancy-associated plasma 
protein A, free beta-human chorionic gonadotropin, inhibin A, and 
alpha-fetoprotein. The primary outcome was preterm birth between 20 0/7 and 36 
6/7 weeks of gestation. The secondary outcomes were spontaneous preterm births, 
medically indicated preterm births, preeclampsia, small-for-gestational-age 
neonates, and stillbirth.
RESULTS: A total of 10,038 eligible gravidas were enrolled in the Nulliparous 
Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-Be cohort, from which a nested 
case-control study was performed comparing 800 cases with preterm birth (466 
spontaneous preterm births, 330 medically indicated preterm births, and 4 
unclassified preterm births), 568 with preeclampsia, 406 with 
small-for-gestational-age birth, and 49 with stillbirth with 911 controls who 
delivered at term without complications. Although levels of each analyte 
generally differed between cases and controls at 1 or 2 visits, the odds ratios 
revealed a <2-fold difference between cases and controls in all comparisons. 
Receiver operating characteristic curves, generated to determine the 
relationship between analyte levels and preterm birth and the other adverse 
pregnancy outcomes, resulted in areas under the receiver operating 
characteristic curves that were relatively low (range, 0.50-0.64) for each 
analyte. Logistic regression modeling demonstrated that areas under the receiver 
operating characteristic curves for predicting adverse pregnancy outcomes were 
greater using baseline clinical characteristics and combinations of analytes 
than baseline characteristics alone, but areas under the receiver operating 
characteristic curves remained relatively low for each outcome (range, 
0.65-0.78).
CONCLUSION: We have found significant associations between maternal serum levels 
of analytes evaluated early in pregnancy and subsequent adverse pregnancy 
outcomes in nulliparous gravidas. However, the test characteristics for these 
analytes do not support their use as clinical biomarkers to predict adverse 
pregnancy outcomes, either alone or in combination with maternal clinical 
characteristics.

PURPOSE: To compare the long-term clinical efficacy provided by intra-articular 
injections of either Pure Platelet-rich Plasma (P-PRP) or sham saline to treat 
knee osteoarthritis (KOA).
METHODS: This prospective, parallel-group, double-blind, multi-center, 
sham-controlled randomized clinical trial recruited participants with KOA from 
orthopedic departments at nine public hospitals (five tertiary medical centers, 
four secondary medical units) starting January 1, 2014, with follow-up completed 
on February 28, 2021. Participants were randomly allocated to interventions in a 
1:1 ratio. Data were analyzed from March 1, 2021, to July 15, 2021. Three 
sessions (1 every week) of P-PRP or sham saline injected by physicians. The 
primary outcome was the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis 
Index (WOMAC) at 3, 6, 12, 24, 60 months of follow-up. Secondary outcomes 
included the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective score, 
visual analogue scale (VAS) score, intra-articular biochemical marker 
concentrations, cartilage volume, and adverse events. Laboratory of each 
hospital analyzed the content and quality of P-PRP.
RESULTS: 610 participants (59% women) with KOA who received three sessions of 
P-PRP (n = 308, mean age 53.91 years) or sham saline (n = 302, mean age 
54.51 years) injections completed the trial. The mean platelet concentration in 
PRP is 4.3-fold (95% confidence interval 3.6-4.5) greater than that of whole 
blood. Both groups showed significant improvements in IKDC, WOMAC, and VAS 
scores at 1 month of follow-up. However, only the P-PRP group showed a sustained 
improvement in clinical outcome measurements at month 24 (P < 0.001). There were 
statistically significant differences between the P-PRP and sham saline groups 
in all clinical outcome measurements at each follow-up time point (P < 0.001). 
The benefit of P-PRP was clinically better in terms of WOMAC-pain, 
WOMAC-physical function and WOMAC-total at 6, 12, 24, and 60 months of 
follow-up. No clinically significant differences between treatments were 
documented in terms of WOMAC-stiffness at any follow-up. A clinically 
significant difference favoring P-PRP group against saline in terms of IKDC and 
VAS scores was documented at 6, 12, 24 and 60 months of follow-up. At 6 months 
after injection, TNF-α and IL-1β levels in synovial fluid were lower in the 
P-PRP group (P < 0.001). Tibiofemoral cartilage volume decreased by a mean value 
of 1171 mm3 in the P-PRP group and 2311 mm3 in the saline group over 60 months 
and the difference between the group was statistically significant (intergroup 
difference, 1140 mm3, 95% CI - 79 to 1320 mm3; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized clinical trial of patients with KOA, P-PRP was 
superior to sham saline in treating KOA. P-PRP was effective for achieving at 
least 24 months of symptom relief and slowing the progress of KOA, with both 
P-PRP and saline being comparable in safety profiles.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, including infliximab and 
adalimumab, are a mainstay of pediatric Crohn's disease therapy; however, 
nonresponse and loss of response are common. As combination therapy with 
methotrexate may improve response, we performed a multicenter, randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled pragmatic trial to compare tumor necrosis 
factor inhibitors with oral methotrexate to tumor necrosis factor inhibitor 
monotherapy.
METHODS: Patients with pediatric Crohn's disease initiating infliximab or 
adalimumab were randomized in 1:1 allocation to methotrexate or placebo and 
followed for 12-36 months. The primary outcome was a composite indicator of 
treatment failure. Secondary outcomes included anti-drug antibodies and 
patient-reported outcomes of pain interference and fatigue. Adverse events (AEs) 
and serious AEs (SAEs) were collected.
RESULTS: Of 297 participants (mean age, 13.9 years, 35% were female), 156 were 
assigned to methotrexate (110 infliximab initiators and 46 adalimumab 
initiators) and 141 to placebo (102 infliximab initiators and 39 adalimumab 
initiators). In the overall population, time to treatment failure did not differ 
by study arm (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.45-1.05). Among infliximab 
initiators, there were no differences between combination and monotherapy 
(hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.55-1.56). Among adalimumab initiators, 
combination therapy was associated with longer time to treatment failure (hazard 
ratio, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.19-0.81). A trend toward lower anti-drug antibody 
development in the combination therapy arm was not significant (infliximab: odds 
ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.49-1.07; adalimumab: odds ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 
0.24-2.07). No differences in patient-reported outcomes were observed. 
Combination therapy resulted in more AEs but fewer SAEs.
CONCLUSIONS: Among adalimumab but not infliximab initiators, patients with 
pediatric Crohn's disease treated with methotrexate combination therapy 
experienced a 2-fold reduction in treatment failure with a tolerable safety 
profile.

BACKGROUND: SOBERANA 02 has been evaluated in phase I and IIa studies comparing 
homologous versus heterologous schedule (this one, including SOBERANA Plus). 
Here, we report results of immunogenicity, safety, and reactogenicity of 
SOBERANA 02 in a two- or three-dose heterologous scheme in adults.
METHOD: Phase IIb was a parallel, multicenter, adaptive, double-blind, 
randomized, and placebo-controlled trial. Subjects (n = 810) aged 19-80 years 
were randomized to receive two doses of SARS-CoV-2 RBD conjugated to tetanus 
toxoid (SOBERANA 02) and a third dose of dimeric RBD (SOBERANA Plus) 28 days 
apart; two production batches of active ingredients of SOBERANA 02 were 
evaluated. Primary outcome was the percentage of seroconverted subjects with 
≥4-fold the anti-RBD immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration. Secondary outcomes 
were safety, reactogenicity, and neutralizing antibodies.
FINDINGS: Seroconversion rate in vaccinees was 76.3% after two doses and 96.8% 
after the third dose of SOBERANA Plus (7.3% in the placebo group). Neutralizing 
IgG antibodies were detected against D614G and variants of concern (VOCs) Alpha, 
Beta, Delta, and Omicron. Specific, functional antibodies were detected 
7-8 months after the third dose. The frequency of serious adverse events (AEs) 
associated with vaccination was very low (0.1%). Local pain was the most 
frequent AE.
CONCLUSIONS: Two doses of SOBERANA 02 were safe and immunogenic in adults. The 
heterologous combination with SOBERANA Plus increased neutralizing antibodies, 
detectable 7-8 months after the third dose.

Comment in
    A data compendium associating the genomes of 12,289 Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis isolates with quantitative resistance phenotypes to 13 antibiotics.

The emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis is a major global public health 
concern that threatens the ability to control the disease. Whole-genome 
sequencing as a tool to rapidly diagnose resistant infections can transform 
patient treatment and clinical practice. While resistance mechanisms are well 
understood for some drugs, there are likely many mechanisms yet to be uncovered, 
particularly for new and repurposed drugs. We sequenced 10,228 Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis (MTB) isolates worldwide and determined the minimum inhibitory 
concentration (MIC) on a grid of 2-fold concentration dilutions for 13 
antimicrobials using quantitative microtiter plate assays. We performed 
oligopeptide- and oligonucleotide-based genome-wide association studies using 
linear mixed models to discover resistance-conferring mechanisms not currently 
catalogued. Use of MIC over binary resistance phenotypes increased sample 
heritability for the new and repurposed drugs by 26% to 37%, increasing our 
ability to detect novel associations. For all drugs, we discovered uncatalogued 
variants associated with MIC, including in the Rv1218c promoter binding site of 
the transcriptional repressor Rv1219c (isoniazid), upstream of the vapBC20 
operon that cleaves 23S rRNA (linezolid) and in the region encoding an α-helix 
lining the active site of Cyp142 (clofazimine, all p < 10-7.7). We observed that 
artefactual signals of cross-resistance could be unravelled based on the 
relative effect size on MIC. Our study demonstrates the ability of very 
large-scale studies to substantially improve our knowledge of genetic variants 
associated with antimicrobial resistance in M. tuberculosis.

What a difference a methylene makes: replacing Glu with Asp or Aad in the 
Lys-urea-Glu pharmacophore of PSMA-targeting radioligands to reduce kidney and 
salivary gland uptake.

Kuo HT(1), Lin KS(1)(2)(3), Zhang Z(1), Zhang C(1), Merkens H(1), Tan R(1), 
Roxin A(1)(3), Uribe CF(2)(3), Bénard F(1)(2)(3).

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of replacing Glu in the 
Lys-urea-Glu PSMA-targeting pharmacophore of [68Ga]Ga-HTK03041 with a close 
analog on the uptake of kidneys, salivary glands and PSMA-expressing tumor 
xenografts. Methods: HTK03161, HTK03149 and HTK03189A/B were obtained by 
replacing Glu in HTK03041 with Asp, Aad (L-2-aminoadipic acid) and Api 
(2-aminopimelic acid), respectively. PSMA binding affinities were measured by 
competition binding assays. PET imaging and biodistribution studies of 
68Ga-labeled ligands were performed in LNCaP tumor-bearing mice. The best 
candidate HTK03149 was selected and radiolabeled with 177Lu, and SPECT imaging 
and biodistribution studies were performed in LNCaP tumor-bearing mice. 
Radiation dosimetry calculation was conducted using the OLINDA software. 
Radioligand therapy study was performed in LNCaP tumor-bearing mice treated with 
[177Lu]Lu-HTK03149 (9.3-148 MBq), [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 (37 MBq) or natLu-HTK03149 
(500 pmol). Results: PSMA binding affinities (Ki) of Ga-HTK03161, Ga-HTK03149, 
Ga-HTK03189A and Lu-HTK03149 were 3.88±0.66, 6.99±0.80, 550±35.7 and 1.57±0.42 
nM, respectively. PET imaging showed that all 68Ga-labeled HTK03161, HTK03149 
and HTK03189A/B were excreted mainly via the renal pathway and had minimal 
uptake in all organs/tissues including kidneys and salivary glands. Tumor 
xenografts were clearly visualized in PET images of [68Ga]Ga-HTK03161 and 
[68Ga]Ga-HTK03149 but were barely visualized using [68Ga]Ga-HTK03189A/B. Tumor 
uptake values for [68Ga]Ga-HTK03161, [68Ga]Ga-HTK03149, [68Ga]Ga-HTK0189A and 
[68Ga]Ga-HTK03189B were 12.7±1.91, 19.1±6.37, 2.10±0.28 and 0.67±0.15 %IA/g, 
respectively at 1h post-injection, and their average kidney and salivary gland 
uptake values were 2.13-4.41 and 0.20-0.23 %IA/g, respectively. Longitudinal 
SPECT imaging studies showed that [177Lu]Lu-HTK03149 was excreted mainly through 
the renal pathway with high uptake in LNCaP tumors and minimal uptake in all 
normal organs/tissues. The tumor uptake of [177Lu]Lu-HTK03149 peaked at 4h 
post-injection (20.9±2.99 %IA/g) and the uptake was sustained over time. 
Compared to [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617, [177Lu]Lu-HTK03149 had 145% increase in tumor 
absorbed dose but 70% less in kidney absorbed dose, leading to an 7.1-fold 
increase in tumor-to-kidney absorbed dose ratio. Radioligand therapy studies 
showed that only half of the [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 injected dosage was needed for 
[177Lu]Lu-HTK03149 to achieve the same median survival. Conclusion: Replacing 
Glu in the PSMA-targeting Lys-urea-Glu pharmacophore of [68Ga]Ga-HTK03041 with 
Asp and Aad generates [68Ga]Ga-HTK03161 and [68Ga]Ga-HTK03149, respectively, and 
the new derivatives retain high uptake in LNCaP tumors and have minimal uptake 
in normal organs/tissues including kidneys and salivary glands. 
[177Lu]Lu-HTK03149 also retain high uptake in LNCaP tumors and has minimal 
uptake in normal organs/tissues, and is, therefore, promising for clinical 
translation to treat prostate cancer.

(COVID-19).

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the illness caused by severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has had a devastating effect on 
the world's population resulting in more than 6 million deaths worldwide and 
emerging as the most significant global health crisis since the influenza 
pandemic of 1918. Since being declared a global pandemic by the World Health 
Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020, the virus continues to cause devastation, 
with many countries continuing to endure multiple waves of outbreaks of this 
viral illness. Adaptive mutations in the viral genome can alter the 
virus's pathogenic potential. Even a single amino acid exchange can drastically 
affect a virus's ability to evade the immune system and complicate the vaccine 
development progress against the virus. SARS-CoV-2, like other RNA viruses, is 
prone to genetic evolution while adapting to their new human hosts with the 
development of mutations over time, resulting in the emergence of multiple 
variants that may have different characteristics compared to its ancestral 
strains. Periodic genomic sequencing of viral samples helps detect new genetic 
variants of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in communities, especially in a global 
pandemic. The genetic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 was minimal during the early phase 
of the pandemic, with the emergence of a globally dominant variant called D614G, 
which was associated with higher transmissibility but without increased disease 
severity of its ancestral strain. Another variant was identified in humans, 
attributed to transmission from infected farmed mink in Denmark, which was not 
associated with increased transmissibility.  Since then, multiple variants of 
SARS-CoV-2 have been described, of which a few are considered variants of 
concern (VOCs), given their impact on public health. VOCs are associated with 
enhanced transmissibility or virulence, reduction in neutralization by 
antibodies obtained through natural infection or vaccination, the ability to 
evade detection, or a decrease in therapeutics or vaccination effectiveness. 
Based on the epidemiological update by the WHO, as of 11 December 2021, five 
SARS-CoV-2 VOCs have been identified since the beginning of the pandemic: Alpha 
(B.1.1.7): first variant of concern described in the United Kingdom (UK) in late 
December 2020. Beta (B.1.351): first reported in South Africa in December 2020. 
Gamma(P.1): first reported in Brazil in early January 2021. Delta 
(B.1.617.2): first reported in India in December 2020. Omicron (B.1.1.529): 
first reported in South Africa in November 2021. All five reported VOCs 
-Alpha(B.1.1.7); Beta(B.1.351); Gamma (P.1); Delta(B.1.617.2); and 
Omicron (B.1.1.529) have mutations in the RBD and the NTD, of which N501Y 
mutation located on the RBD is common to all variants except the Delta variant 
which results in increased affinity of the spike protein to ACE 2 receptors 
enhancing the viral attachment and its subsequent entry into the host cells. 
Along with NBD, RBD serves as the dominant neutralization target and facilitates 
antibody production in response to antisera or vaccines. Two recent preprints 
reported that a single mutation of N501Y alone increases the affinity between 
RBD and ACE2 approximately ten times more than the ancestral strain 
(N501-RBD). Interestingly the binding affinity of the Beta (B.1.351) variant and 
Gamma (P.1) variant with mutations N417/K848/Y501-RBD and ACE2 was much lower 
than that of N501Y-RBD and ACE2. The mutations seen in Omicron are described 
below.  Despite the extraordinary speed of vaccine development against COVID-19 
and continued mass vaccination efforts, including guidelines recommending 
vaccine boosters, the continued emergence of new variant strains of SARS-CoV-2 
threatens to overturn the significant progress made so far in halting the spread 
of SARS-CoV-2. This review article aims to comprehensively describe these new 
variants of concern, the latest therapeutics available in managing COVID-19 in 
adults, and the efficacy of different available vaccines against this virus and 
its new variants. SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern (VOCs) With the emergence of 
multiple variants, the CDC and the WHO have independently established a 
classification system for distinguishing the emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 
into variants of concern(VOCs) and variants of interest(VOIs). Alpha (B.1.1.7 
lineage): In late December 2020, a new SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern, B.1.1.7 
lineage, also referred to as Alpha variant or GRY(formerly GR/501Y.V1), was 
reported in the UK based on whole-genome sequencing of samples from patients who 
tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In addition to being detected by genomic 
sequencing, the B.1.1.7 variant was identified in a frequently used commercial 
assay characterized by the absence of the S gene (S-gene target failure, SGTF) 
PCR samples. The B.1.1.7 variant includes 17 mutations in the viral genome. Of 
these, eight mutations (Δ69-70 deletion, Δ144 deletion, N501Y, A570D, P681H, 
T716I, S982A, D1118H) are in the spike (S) protein. N501Y shows an increased 
affinity of the spike protein to ACE 2 receptors, enhancing the viral attachment 
and subsequent entry into host cells. This variant of concern was circulating in 
the UK as early as September 2020 and was based on various model projections. It 
was reported to be 43% to 82% more transmissible, surpassing preexisting 
variants of SARS-CoV-2 to emerge as the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the 
UK. The B.1.1.7 variant was reported in the United States (US) at the end of 
December 2020. An initial matched case-control study reported no significant 
difference in the risk of hospitalization or associated mortality with the 
B.1.1.7 lineage variant compared to other existing variants. However, subsequent 
studies have reported that people infected with B.1.1.7 lineage variant had 
increased disease severity compared to those infected with other circulating 
virus variants. A large matched cohort study performed in the UK reported that 
the mortality hazard ratio of patients infected with the B.1.1.7 lineage variant 
was 1.64 (95% confidence interval 1.32 to 2.04, P<0.0001) patients with 
previously circulating strains. Another study reported that the B 1.1.7 variant 
was associated with increased mortality compared to other SARS-CoV-2 variants 
(HR= 1.61, 95% CI 1.42-1.82). The risk of death was reportedly greater (adjusted 
hazard ratio 1.67, 95% CI 1.34-2.09) among individuals with confirmed B.1.1.7 
variant of concern compared with individuals with non-1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2. Beta 
(B.1.351 lineage): Tegally et al. reported a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 lineage 
B.1.351, also referred to as Beta variant or GH501Y.V2, with multiple spike 
mutations, which resulted in the second wave of COVID-19 infections in Nelson 
Mandela Bay in South Africa in October 2020. The B.1.351 variant includes nine 
mutations (L18F, D80A, D215G, R246I, K417N, E484K, N501Y, D614G, and A701V) in 
the spike protein, of which three mutations (K417N, E484K, and N501Y) are 
located in the RBD and increase the binding affinity for the ACE 
receptors. SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2(B.1.351 lineage) was reported in the US at the end 
of January 2021. This variant is reported to have an increased risk of 
transmission and reduced neutralization by monoclonal antibody therapy, 
convalescent sera, and post-vaccination sera. Gamma (P.1 lineage): The third 
variant of concern, the P.1 variant, also known as the Gamma 
variant or GR/501Y.V3, was identified in December 2020 in Brazil and was first 
detected in the US in January 2021. . The B.1.1.28 variant harbors 11 mutations 
in the spike protein (L18F, T20N, P26S, D138Y, R190S, H655Y, T1027I V1176, 
K417T, E484K, and N501Y). Three mutations (L18F, K417N, E484K) are located in 
the RBD, similar to the B.1.351 variant. Based on the WHO epidemiological update 
on 30 March 2021, this variant has spread to 45 countries. Significantly, this 
variant may have reduced neutralization by monoclonal antibody therapies, 
convalescent sera, and post-vaccination sera. Delta (B.1.617.2 lineage): The 
fourth variant of concern, B.1.617.2, also referred to as the Delta variant, was 
initially identified in December 2020 in India and was responsible for the 
deadly second wave of COVID-19 infections in April 2021 in India. In the United 
States, this variant was first detected in March 2021 and is currently the most 
dominant SARS-CoV-2 strain in the US. The Delta variant was initially considered 
a variant of interest. However, this variant rapidly spread worldwide, prompting 
the WHO to classify it as a VOC in May 2021. The B.1.617.2 variant harbors ten 
mutations ( T19R, (G142D*), 156del, 157del, R158G, L452R, T478K, D614G, P681R, 
D950N) in the spike protein. Omicron (B.1.1.529 lineage): The fifth variant of 
concern, B.1.1.529, also designated as the Omicron variant by the WHO, was first 
identified in South Africa on 23 November 2021 after an uptick in the number of 
cases of COVID-19. . Omicron was quickly recognized as a VOC due to more than 30 
changes to the spike protein of the virus, along with the sharp rise in the 
number of cases observed in South Africa. The reported mutations include T91 in 
the envelope, P13L, E31del, R32del, S33del, R203K, G204R in the nucleocapsid 
protein, D3G, Q19E, A63T in the matrix, N211del/L212I, Y145del, Y144del, 
Y143del, G142D, T95I, V70del, H69del, A67V in the N-terminal domain of the 
spike, Y505H, N501Y, Q498R, G496S, Q493R, E484A, T478K, S477N, G446S, N440K, 
K417N, S375F, S373P, S371L, G339D in the receptor-binding domain of the spike, 
D796Y in the fusion peptide of the spike, L981F, N969K, Q954H in the heptad 
repeat 1 of the spike as well as multiple other mutations in the non-structural 
proteins and spike protein. Initial modeling suggests that Omicron shows 
a 13-fold increase in viral infectivity and is 2.8 times more infectious than 
the Delta variant. Previously authorized monoclonal antibodies demonstrated 
reduced efficacy against the Omicron variant and subsequently revoked their 
emergency use authorizations. The only authorized monoclonal antibody at this 
time is sotrovimab because it remains effective against this variant. . The 
Spike mutation K417N (also seen in the Beta variant) along with E484A is 
predicted to have an overwhelmingly disruptive effect, making Omicron more 
likely to have vaccine breakthroughs. The Omicron (B.1.1.529) became the 
dominant VOC in many countries, and many subvariants, such as BA.1, BA.2, BA.3, 
BA.4, and BA.5, were identified. The Omicron VOC is currently the dominant 
SARS-CoV-2 variant in the US, according to the CDC. SARS-CoV-2 Variants of 
Interest (VOIs) VOIs are defined as variants with specific genetic markers that 
have been associated with changes that may cause enhanced transmissibility or 
virulence, reduction in neutralization by antibodies obtained through natural 
infection or vaccination, the ability to evade detection, or a decrease in the 
effectiveness of therapeutics or vaccination. So far, since the beginning of the 
pandemic, the WHO has described eight variants of interest (VOIs), 
namely Epsilon (B.1.427 and B.1.429); Zeta (P.2); Eta( B.1.525); Theta (P.3); 
Iota (B.1.526); Kappa(B.1.617.1); Lambda(C.37)and Mu (B.1.621). Epsilon (B.1.427 
and B.1.429) variants, also called CAL.20C/L452R, emerged in the US around June 
2020 and increased from 0% to >50% of sequenced cases from 1 September 2020 to 
29 January 2021, exhibiting an 18.6-24% increase in transmissibility relative to 
wild-type circulating strains. These variants harbor specific mutations 
(B.1.427: L452R, D614G; B.1.429: S13I, W152C, L452R, D614G). Due to its 
increased transmissibility, the CDC classified this strain as a variant of 
concern in the US. Zeta (P.2) has key spike mutations (L18F; T20N; P26S; F157L; 
E484K; D614G; S929I; and V1176F) and was first detected in Brazil in April 2020. 
This variant is classified as a VOI by the WHO and the CDC due to its potential 
reduction in neutralization by antibody treatments and vaccine sera. Eta 
(B.1.525) and Iota (B.1.526) variants harbor key spike mutations (B.1.525: A67V, 
Δ69/70, Δ144, E484K, D614G, Q677H, F888L; B.1.526: (L5F*), T95I, D253G, 
(S477N*), (E484K*), D614G, (A701V*)) and were first detected in New York in 
November 2020 and classified as a variant of interest by CDC and the WHO due to 
their potential reduction in neutralization by antibody treatments and vaccine 
sera. Theta (P.3) variant, also called GR/1092K.V1, carries key spike mutations 
(141-143 deletion E484K; N501Y; and P681H) and was first detected in the 
Philippines and Japan in February 2021 and is classified as a variant of 
interest by the WHO. Kappa(B.1.617.1) variant harbors key mutations ((T95I), 
G142D, E154K, L452R, E484Q, D614G, P681R, and Q1071H) and was first detected in 
India in December 2021 and is classified as a variant of interest by the WHO and 
the CDC. Lambda(C.37) variant was first detected in Peru and has been designated 
as a VOI by the WHO in June 2021 due to a heightened presence of this variant in 
the South American region. Mu(B.1.621) variant was identified in Columbia and 
was designated as a VOI by the WHO in August 2021. The CDC has designated 
the Epsilon (B.1.427 and B.1.429) variants as VOC and Eta(B.1.525); 
Iota (B.1.526); Kappa(B.1.617.1); Zeta (P.2); Mu(B.1.621, B.1.621.1) 
and B.1.617.3 as VOIs. In comparison to the current circulating SARS-CoV-2 
variants, previously designated VOCs and VOIs that are circulating in at 
negligible levels or are undetectable and do not pose a significant risk to 
global public health are designated as previously circulating VOCs or VOIs by 
the WHO and Variants Being Monitored (VBM) by the CDC.

Dietary interventions may best be delivered at supermarkets, which offer 
convenience, accessibility, full food inventories and, increasingly, in-store 
registered dietitians, online shopping and delivery services. In collaboration 
with a large retail supermarket chain, we conducted a multisite supermarket and 
web-based intervention targeting nutrition trial (no. NCT03895580), randomizing 
participants (n = 247 (139 women and 108 men)) 2:2:1 to two levels of dietary 
education (Strategy 1 and Strategy 2) or an enhanced control group that included 
educational components beyond the routine standard of care. Both Strategies 1 
and 2 included individualized, in-person, dietitian-led, purchasing data-guided 
interventions. Strategy 2 also included online tools for shopping, home 
delivery, selection of healthier purchases, meal planning and healthy recipes. 
The primary endpoint was change in dietary approaches to stop hypertension 
(DASH) score (a measure of adherence to the DASH diet) from baseline to 
3 months. The primary endpoint was met because, at 3 months, the DASH score 
increased by 4.7 more for the combined Strategy 1 and Strategy 2 groups than for 
the control group (95% confidence interval (CI) (0.9, 8.5), P = 0.02). In a 
prespecified hierarchical test, at 3 months, DASH score increased by 3.8 more 
for the Strategy 2 group than for the Strategy 1 group (95% CI (0.8, 6.)9, 
P = 0.01). This trial demonstrates the efficacy of data-guided, 
supermarket-based, dietary interventions and modern online shopping tools in 
improving dietary quality in a free-living, community-based population. The 
trial also demonstrates the opportunity for academic investigators to 
collaborate with retailers to design and rigorously test comprehensive 
healthcare interventions.

BACKGROUND: Anti-drug antibodies are associated with treatment failure to 
anti-TNF agents in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
AIM: To assess whether immunogenicity to a patient's first anti-TNF agent would 
be associated with immunogenicity to the second, irrespective of drug sequence 
METHODS: We conducted a UK-wide, multicentre, retrospective cohort study to 
report rates of immunogenicity and treatment failure of second anti-TNF 
therapies in 1058 patients with IBD who underwent therapeutic drug monitoring 
for both infliximab and adalimumab. The primary outcome was immunogenicity to 
the second anti-TNF agent, defined at any timepoint as an anti-TNF antibody 
concentration ≥9 AU/ml for infliximab and ≥6 AU/ml for adalimumab.
RESULTS: In patients treated with infliximab and then adalimumab, those who 
developed antibodies to infliximab were more likely to develop antibodies to 
adalimumab, than patients who did not develop antibodies to infliximab (OR 1.99, 
95%CI 1.27-3.20, p = 0.002). Similarly, in patients treated with adalimumab and 
then infliximab, immunogenicity to adalimumab was associated with subsequent 
immunogenicity to infliximab (OR 2.63, 95%CI 1.46-4.80, p < 0.001). For each 
10-fold increase in anti-infliximab and anti-adalimumab antibody concentration, 
the odds of subsequently developing antibodies to adalimumab and infliximab 
increased by 1.73 (95% CI 1.38-2.17, p < 0.001) and 1.99 (95%CI 1.34-2.99, 
p < 0.001), respectively. Patients who developed immunogenicity with 
undetectable drug levels to infliximab were more likely to develop 
immunogenicity with undetectable drug levels to adalimumab (OR 2.37, 95% CI 
1.39-4.19, p < 0.001). Commencing an immunomodulator at the time of switching to 
the second anti-TNF was associated with improved drug persistence in patients 
with immunogenic, but not pharmacodynamic failure.
CONCLUSION: Irrespective of drug sequence, immunogenicity to the first anti-TNF 
agent was associated with immunogenicity to the second, which was mitigated by 
the introduction of an immunomodulator in patients with immunogenic, but not 
pharmacodynamic treatment failure.

Collaborators.

BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
(HIV/AIDS) is still among the leading causes of disease burden and mortality in 
sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and the world is not on track to meet targets set for 
ending the epidemic by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) 
and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Precise HIV burden 
information is critical for effective geographic and epidemiological targeting 
of prevention and treatment interventions. Age- and sex-specific HIV prevalence 
estimates are widely available at the national level, and region-wide local 
estimates were recently published for adults overall. We add further 
dimensionality to previous analyses by estimating HIV prevalence at local 
scales, stratified into sex-specific 5-year age groups for adults ages 15-59 
years across SSA.
METHODS: We analyzed data from 91 seroprevalence surveys and sentinel 
surveillance among antenatal care clinic (ANC) attendees using model-based 
geostatistical methods to produce estimates of HIV prevalence across 43 
countries in SSA, from years 2000 to 2018, at a 5 × 5-km resolution and 
presented among second administrative level (typically districts or counties) 
units.
RESULTS: We found substantial variation in HIV prevalence across localities, 
ages, and sexes that have been masked in earlier analyses. Within-country 
variation in prevalence in 2018 was a median 3.5 times greater across ages and 
sexes, compared to for all adults combined. We note large within-district 
prevalence differences between age groups: for men, 50% of districts displayed 
at least a 14-fold difference between age groups with the highest and lowest 
prevalence, and at least a 9-fold difference for women. Prevalence trends also 
varied over time; between 2000 and 2018, 70% of all districts saw a reduction in 
prevalence greater than five percentage points in at least one sex and age 
group. Meanwhile, over 30% of all districts saw at least a five percentage point 
prevalence increase in one or more sex and age group.
CONCLUSIONS: As the HIV epidemic persists and evolves in SSA, geographic and 
demographic shifts in prevention and treatment efforts are necessary. These 
estimates offer epidemiologically informative detail to better guide more 
targeted interventions, vital for combating HIV in SSA.

    J Neurol. 2023 Apr 18;:

Risdiplam is an oral, survival of motor neuron 2 (SMN2) pre-mRNA splicing 
modifier approved for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). SUNFISH 
(NCT02908685) Part 2, a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
study, investigated the efficacy and safety of risdiplam in type 2 and 
non‑ambulant type 3 SMA. The primary endpoint was met: a significantly greater 
change from baseline in 32-item Motor Function Measure (MFM32) total score was 
observed with risdiplam compared with placebo at month 12. After 12 months, all 
participants received risdiplam while preserving initial treatment blinding. We 
report 24-month efficacy and safety results in this population. Month 24 
exploratory endpoints included change from baseline in MFM32 and safety. 
MFM‑derived results were compared with an external comparator. At month 24 of 
risdiplam treatment, 32% of patients demonstrated improvement (a change of ≥ 3) 
from baseline in MFM32 total score; 58% showed stabilization (a change of ≥ 0). 
Compared with an external comparator, a treatment difference of 3.12 (95% 
confidence interval [CI] 1.67-4.57) in favor of risdiplam was observed in 
MFM-derived scores. Overall, gains in motor function at month 12 were maintained 
or improved upon at month 24. In patients initially receiving placebo, MFM32 
remained stable compared with baseline (0.31 [95% CI - 0.65 to 1.28]) after 
12 months of risdiplam; 16% of patients improved their score and 59% exhibited 
stabilization. The safety profile after 24 months was consistent with that 
observed after 12 months. Risdiplam over 24 months resulted in further 
improvement or stabilization in motor function, confirming the benefit of 
longer-term treatment.

INTRODUCTION: Despite a growing body of research on the risks of SARS-CoV-2 
infection during pregnancy, there is continued controversy given heterogeneity 
in the quality and design of published studies.
METHODS: We screened ongoing studies in our sequential, prospective 
meta-analysis. We pooled individual participant data to estimate the absolute 
and relative risk (RR) of adverse outcomes among pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 
infection, compared with confirmed negative pregnancies. We evaluated the risk 
of bias using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.
RESULTS: We screened 137 studies and included 12 studies in 12 countries 
involving 13 136 pregnant women.Pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection-as 
compared with uninfected pregnant women-were at significantly increased risk of 
maternal mortality (10 studies; n=1490; RR 7.68, 95% CI 1.70 to 34.61); 
admission to intensive care unit (8 studies; n=6660; RR 3.81, 95% CI 2.03 to 
7.17); receiving mechanical ventilation (7 studies; n=4887; RR 15.23, 95% CI 
4.32 to 53.71); receiving any critical care (7 studies; n=4735; RR 5.48, 95% CI 
2.57 to 11.72); and being diagnosed with pneumonia (6 studies; n=4573; RR 23.46, 
95% CI 3.03 to 181.39) and thromboembolic disease (8 studies; n=5146; RR 5.50, 
95% CI 1.12 to 27.12).Neonates born to women with SARS-CoV-2 infection were more 
likely to be admitted to a neonatal care unit after birth (7 studies; n=7637; RR 
1.86, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.08); be born preterm (7 studies; n=6233; RR 1.71, 95% CI 
1.28 to 2.29) or moderately preterm (7 studies; n=6071; RR 2.92, 95% CI 1.88 to 
4.54); and to be born low birth weight (12 studies; n=11 930; RR 1.19, 95% CI 
1.02 to 1.40). Infection was not linked to stillbirth. Studies were generally at 
low or moderate risk of bias.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis indicates that SARS-CoV-2 infection at any time 
during pregnancy increases the risk of maternal death, severe maternal 
morbidities and neonatal morbidity, but not stillbirth or intrauterine growth 
restriction. As more data become available, we will update these findings per 
the published protocol.
